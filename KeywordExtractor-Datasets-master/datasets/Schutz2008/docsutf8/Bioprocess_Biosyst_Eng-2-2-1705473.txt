Corynebacterium glutamicum
, higher glutamate concentration could be achieved by constantly controlling dissolved oxygen concentration (DO) at a lower level; however, by-product lactate also severely accumulated. The results of analyzing activities changes of the two key enzymes, glutamate and lactate dehydrogenases involved with the fermentation, and the entire metabolic network flux analysis showed that the lactate overproduction was because the metabolic flux in TCA cycle was too low to balance the glucose glycolysis rate. As a result, the respiratory quotient (RQ) adaptive control based “balanced metabolic control” (BMC) strategy was proposed and used to regulate the TCA metabolic flux rate at an appropriate level to achieve the metabolic balance among glycolysis, glutamate synthesis, and TCA metabolic flux. Compared with the best results of various DO constant controls, the BMC strategy increased the maximal glutamate concentration by about 15% and almost completely repressed the lactate accumulation with competitively high glutamate productivity.

], we found that dissolved oxygen (DO) largely affected the metabolic flux distribution and the glutamate fermentation performance. The comprehensive analysis or evaluation of a fermentation process by the MR model-based metabolic flux analysis integrated with the intracellular enzymes activities monitoring, might gain a deeper insight into the entire fermentation process and the metabolic regulation mechanisms, so as to supply a more comprehensive and accurate information base for the subsequent process control and optimization of the fermentation process.
C. glutamicum
, the two major enzymes (GDH and LDH), which possibly dominated the overall glutamate metabolism, were carefully investigated. Then, based on the comprehensive evaluation results of both the metabolic flux analysis and intracellular enzymes activities monitoring, a new optimization strategy of “balanced metabolic control (BMC)” was proposed and verified experimentally, aiming to increase the glutamate production yield, while completely repressing the by-product overproduction simultaneously.

 was cultured for glutamate production at 32°C in a 5 L fermentor (BIOTECH-5BG, Baoxing Co., China) containing about 3.4 L medium. Concentrated glucose was fed based on requirement to ensure the substrate concentration above a suitable level (15 g/L) throughout the fermentation period. pH was controlled at 7.1 ± 0.1 by automatic addition of 25% (w/w) ammonia water which also supplied the nitrogen source required for glutamate synthesis. DO was controlled at various levels by automatically or manually controlling the agitation speed based on particular requirements. The air aeration rate and fermentor pressure were kept constantly at 1.60 vvm and 0.07 MPa, respectively.

b indicated the changing pattern of the GDH and LDH activities under the same DO control levels. The GDH activity for the lower DO case (10%) was much higher and declined slower than that of the higher DO case (50%) after experiencing the enzymatic activity peak of about 1.8 U/mg-protein around 12–13 h. This result could at least explain or account for the fact that, higher glutamate production rate and accumulation occurred at lower DO control level in the initial and middle production phases of 8–20 h. The slow down of glutamate production rate in the late production stage (20–30 h) and the final stoppage of glutamate production were due to the reduction of the co-enzyme NADPH regeneration rate, which will be further discussed in the following section. As for the LDH activities, from the result of severe lactate’s accumulation at lower DO level, it was speculated that the LDH activity under lower DO level (10%) should also be much higher than that of the higher DO case. However, the result did not agree with the expectation. Although the LDH activity under lower DO level was slightly higher than that of the higher DO for the majority of the fermentation period, this result could not stand for the large difference in the lactate accumulation under different DO levels.

] showed that at the end of the fermentation, the coenzyme NADPH regeneration rate had decreased to 5–20% of its peak level (figure not presented). Therefore, it could be concluded that, the glutamate synthesis stoppage was due to the significant reduction of NADPH regeneration rate instead of the reduction in GDH activity.

Summary
A novel fermentation optimization method—the “balanced metabolic control” (BMC) strategy was proposed and successfully used by feedback controlling RQ to regulate the TCA metabolic flux rate at an appropriate level to achieve the metabolic balance among glycolysis, glutamate synthesis, and TCA metabolic flux for glutamate fermentation. The proposed BMC strategy greatly improved the fermentation performance in the two terms of maximal glutamate concentration and the lactate overflow repression. The maximal glutamate concentration increased by about 15% compared with the best results of the DO constant controls, and furthermore, the lactate overproduction occurred in the DO constant control cases could be completely relieved when using the BMC strategy. As a result, the proposed BMC strategy is expected to be applicable for optimization of other aerobic amino acids fermentations in potential.
