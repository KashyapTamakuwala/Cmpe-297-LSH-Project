We assessed peer status with respect to both achievement-related (being a good learner, being good at sports, being good-looking) and affection-related (being liked, being disliked, being best friend) areas. In boys, depressive problems were most strongly associated with not being good at sports, while in girls the association was strongest for not being liked. The risk of a low status in one area could largely be compensated by a high status in another area.

Social status can be defined in at least two ways: in terms of achievements (being admired) and in terms of affection (being liked). These two definitions are related, but by no means interchangeable, and could be differentially linked to depressive problems. The former contains an element of competition (being better than others), while the latter relates to being accepted or rejected by the social group. We will compare the relative importance of both of them with respect to depressive problems in early adolescent girls and boys.

We hypothesized that low peer status in the achievement-related domain would be most relevant for depressive problems in boys, whereas girls’ depressive problems would be more strongly associated with low affection-related peer status. A further hypothesis was that high peer status in a particular area, although not necessarily associated with the probability of depressive problems in itself, would reduce the association between depressive problems and low status in another status area.


Method
Sample
The TRacking Adolescents’ Individual Lives Survey (TRAILS) is a prospective cohort study of Dutch (pre)adolescents, with the aim to chart and explain the development of mental health from preadolescence into adulthood, which started in 2001.
Sample selection involved two steps. First, five municipalities in the North of the Netherlands, including both urban and rural areas, were requested to give names and addresses of all inhabitants born between 10‒01‒1989 and 09‒30‒1990 (first two municipalities) or 10‒01‒1990 and 09‒30‒1991 (last three municipalities), yielding 3483 names. Simultaneously, primary schools (including schools for special education) within these municipalities were approached with the request to participate in TRAILS. School participation was a prerequisite for eligible children and their parents to be approached by the TRAILS staff. Of the 135 primary schools within the municipalities, 122 (90.4% of the schools accommodating 90.3% of the children) agreed to participate in the study.

Disruptive behavior
Disruptive behavior was included to adjust for comorbidity. Disruptive behavior was assessed with the CBCL and the YSR, by combining the items for Oppositional Defiant Disorder and Conduct Disorder, which resulted in a scale of 22 (CBCL, Cronbach’s α = 0.86) or 20 (YSR, Cronbach’s α = 0.79) items.

Finally, we examined whether low status in (at least) one area could be compensated by high status in one or more other areas. Peer-status variables that were significantly related to depressive problems (as established by correlations with the effects of gender and disruptive behavior partialled out) were used to create four combined status groups: 1 = low & high, referring to adolescents with a low status (i.e., below the 20th percentile) in at least one area and a high status (above the 80th percentile) in at least one area; 2 = only low, designating adolescents with a low status in at least one area and no high status; 3 = only high, representing adolescents with a high status in at least one area and no low status, and 4 = intermediate, that is, adolescents with an intermediate status in all areas. Depressive problems in the only-low, only-high, and intermediate group were compared to those in the low & high group (the reference category) by linear regression analysis, adjusting for disruptive behaviors and for dependent observations within classes. Gender differences in each of the associations were tested by interaction effects. A lower depression score in the low & high group than in the only-low group suggests that compensation of a low status by a high status in another area is possible; a lower depression score in the only-high group than in the low & high group suggests that a low status counteracts the benefits of a high status in another area. Comparison of the intermediate group with the low & high group provides insight in the differences between being extraordinary (in any direction) and being average. To take into account that the specific areas may represent the two broad domains of achievement-related and affection-related status disproportionately, this procedure was repeated for the strongest predictor of each.
p
-value smaller than .05 was considered statistically significant. Because we performed multiple statistical tests, the results may suffer from capitalization on chance: one would expect some 5% of the associations examined to be significant merely on the basis of chance, and the probability to find at least one significant effect increases with every additional statistical test. We therefore recommend to consider the general pattern of associations, rather than interpreting each individual effect as if it were the only one tested.

Hierarchy of status areas
To distinguish between associations with low and high status, each of the peer-status variables was categorized into low status (below the 20th percentile), high status (above the 80th percentile), and intermediate status (between the 20th and 80th percentile). For being disliked, high status referred to the lowest 20% (few nominations) and low status to the highest 20% (many nominations). The distribution of the peer nominations precluded that the high-status group of being disliked contained approximately 20% of the cases: 32.0% of the adolescents were nominated by no one and hence classified as having high disliked status.

). For adolescents, one of the most salient social groups is made up by their classmates. In this study on associations between classroom peer status and depressive problems in young adolescents from the general population, the peer status variables explained about 7% of the variance in depressive problems (unadjusted for measurement error, hence underestimating the true variance), which is a modest, yet noteworthy amount.
We hypothesized that peer status in the achievement-related domain would be most relevant for depressive problems in boys, whereas girls’ depressive problems would be more strongly associated to their affection-related peer nominations. A further hypothesis was that high alternative hierarchical positions would (wholly or partly) counteract the association between depressive problems and low status in a particular status area. These hypotheses were largely supported by the data, although it should be noted that the expected patterns were not found in all status areas investigated. Compared with other status areas, not being good at sports, hence a low achievement-related status, was most strongly associated with depressive problems in boys; while not being liked, hence a low status on an affection-related area, had the strongest association with depressive problems in girls. However, our data suggest that not being good at sports may affect girls’ well-being as well, and the gender difference regarding this status domain, although showing a trend, was not statistically significant. Not being liked, on the other hand, appeared to be related to depressive problems in girls only. Hence, girls seem to be more sensitive than boys to affection-related status, particularly to a lack of peers that like them.

), which apparently makes them more vulnerable to low status in relevant areas. However, we found some indications that sports-related achievements may be relevant for girls too. This finding could hint at a dwindling of traditional socio-cultural gender differences; but it could as well be due to the fact that not being good at sports reflects not only a low probability of winning in ritual fights, but also lack of physical energy and activity, which is likely to occur in both depressed boys and depressed girls. The issue of reverse causality is discussed more extensively hereafter.

). Secondly, the study could be extended to include other outcomes, not only within the domain of psychopathology, but also regarding somatic health. Thirdly, it is highly relevant from a public-health point of view to (further) explore to what extent and how peer processes can be manipulated in order to prevent aversive outcomes.
