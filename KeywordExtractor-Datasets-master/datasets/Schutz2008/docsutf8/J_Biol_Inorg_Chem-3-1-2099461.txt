In contrast, attempts to understand the reaction mechanism of tungstoenzymes, in particular for the members of the AOR family, are more recent and of limited extent, although the available structural information on tungstoenzymes and that on molybdoenzymes are comparable. The present study leads to the first proposal of a complete catalytic cycle of the AOR family member formaldehyde oxidoreductase (FOR).

Subunit molecular weight and degree of purity were determined with sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using a Phast system (GE Healthcare).
FOR activity was routinely assayed at 80 °C, under anaerobic conditions, with formaldehyde, or glutardialdehyde, as the substrate and 3 mM benzyl viologen as the electron acceptor in 50 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazinepropanesulfonic acid (Epps) buffer, pH 8.4.

The UV–vis data were obtained by recording 400 spectra at different time scales (16, 65 and 250 s). A spectrum obtained 2 ms after mixing was taken as the “oxidized” reference spectrum. Fluorescence data were obtained by exciting the samples at 280 nm, and the change in maximum fluorescence emission was measured at 340 nm.

 reported in the literature for ferredoxin was determined with high concentrations of formaldehyde. An explanation for this high value is that at high concentrations (50 mM) formaldehyde inhibits and partially denatures FOR.

Pre-steady-state kinetics
Pre-steady-state kinetics studies were performed at 50 °C. This relatively low temperature was dictated by technical limitations of the stopped-flow apparatus. FOR activity at 50 °C is 2.8 times less than at 80 °C, which affords an increased time resolution of enzyme intermediates.
Difference spectra from the pre-steady-state data revealed peak shifts and a lack of isosbestic points. These features are an indication that several processes are happening in the first seconds of the reaction. The visible spectrum of the iron–sulfur cubane consists of a single broad line at approximately 400–430 nm; the relatively weakly colored metallopterin is found at different wavelengths.

 formaldehyde oxidoreductase reacting with formaldehyde. Rate constants with capital letters as a subscript involve binding, oxidizing the substrate, releasing the product, and rearranging electrons between the tungsten center and the iron–sulfur cluster. Alternatively, rate constants with numbered subscripts involve oxidation of substrate, a conformational change leading to weakened product binding, release of product, and electron rearrangement

 as a rectangle with two redox groups, a tungstopterin (W) with oxidation states 6+, 5+, or 4+, and a [4Fe–4S] cubane cluster with oxidation states 2+ or 1+. On the left of W is an empty binding pocket which can be occupied by substrate (A), by product (P), or by ready-to-leave deactivated product (P*). Occupation by A means that the enzyme has acquired a molecule of substrate in the previous reaction. Similarly, a W capped by a double-bonded O means that the enzyme has previously acquired an oxygen (protonation undefined) from the solvent. The protein is initially in the fully oxidized form; the tungsten center is 6+ and has an oxygen atom bound that was previously acquired from a water molecule, and the iron–sulfur cluster is 2+.

. The fully oxidized enzyme is reductively activated by the reaction with formaldehyde to enter a redox cycle in which the enzyme shuttles between one--electron-reduced, two--electron-reduced, and three-electron-reduced states. See the text for additional explanation




Under this model the steps observed in the pre-steady-state experiments would actually constitute an activation process. Note that once the steady state of this cycle has been reached, the enzyme reacts sequentially with one formaldehyde and two ferredoxin molecules consistent with the “A+2B” Michaelis–Menten steady-state analysis.
7
 is based on a combination of steady state-kinetics, pre-steady-state kinetics, and EPR studies in the absence of an electron acceptor and available structural data. Future pre-steady-state kinetics studies in the presence of excess natural electron acceptor ferredoxin may put the model to a rigorous, be it experimentally challenging, test.
