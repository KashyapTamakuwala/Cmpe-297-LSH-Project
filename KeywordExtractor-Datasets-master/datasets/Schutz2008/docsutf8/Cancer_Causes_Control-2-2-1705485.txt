The anatomic distribution of cutaneous melanoma reflects people’s levels and patterns of sun exposure. While examining trends of incident invasive melanomas by site in recent decades in Australia we noted significant increases in incidence on the ears but not the face or any other site in women younger than 40 years, by 6% (95% confidence interval [CI] 2–10%) per year, and 40–59 years by 7% (95% CI 4–10%) per year. Men of the same age showed no corresponding changes in ear melanoma. However incidence rates of ear melanoma in general were fourfold higher in males than females in Australia. Further, using data from the National Cancer Institute’s Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Program, rates of invasive melanoma on the ear were found to be sevenfold higher in males than females in the US population in the same period. Higher rates of scalp and neck melanomas were also seen in men and women in both populations. We therefore speculated that the isolated rises of ear melanoma in younger women in Australia, and the higher overall rates of ear, scalp and neck melanoma in men compared with women, reflect differences in hair coverage. We tested the specific hypothesis that hair cover reduces sun exposure of the ears using experimental manikins and found that hair cover of the ear reduced solar ultraviolet-B exposure by 81% [SE ±8] compared with uncovered ears. We conclude that hair cover can protect against invasive melanoma on the ear and may similarly protect on the scalp and neck. When discretionary, hair may be an important additional factor to be considered for melanoma prevention.

]. When we searched for published data regarding the sun protection factor of hair we found none. Hence we set out to test the specific hypothesis that hair cover protects the ear from sun exposure using experimental manikins.

Recent trends in melanoma in Australia
Based on data for 109,062 invasive melanomas assembled by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare from cancer registries in all Australian states and territories, trends in incidence of cutaneous melanoma in Australia 1982–1999 by sex and site were examined. Sites of invasive melanoma were pre-classified by cancer registries according to a standard protocol. For each site annual notifications were provided with age in 5-year bands. Population estimates by age and sex were obtained for each year from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Annual sex-specific incidence rates of melanoma age-standardized to the WHO World Population were computed for each site and relative rates of increase were calculated for three age bands, less than 40 years, 40–59 years and 60 years and over, by regressing the logarithms of these rates on years.

Measurement of solar ultraviolet radiation on ears in relation to hair cover using head-forms and polysulfone dosimeters




Ears covered by hair received on average 81% [SE ±8] less solar UV radiation than bare ears when exposed to the sun. As a control site on the face, the corresponding solar UV exposures to the noses of the manikins were monitored (Fig. 1) and showed a slight variation during the experiment in the reverse direction, namely a 5% [SE ±3.4] increase in UV radiation to the wigged manikins compared with the bare manikin.

Discussion
These experimental data support our hypothesis that hair cover offers substantial sun protection of the skin of the ear and by extrapolation, the skin of the scalp and back of the neck as well if hair is worn long. Taken together with the recently observed change in incidence of invasive melanoma on the ear in women in Australia and the consistent pattern in Australia and the United States of lower incidence of melanoma in females on the scalp, ear and neck – sites that are more frequently covered or screened by hair than in males, the evidence suggests that hair cover can indeed protect against invasive melanoma on these sites.

] if caps rather than hats were worn. However even if change from hats to caps did explain the recent rise in incidence of ear melanomas in Australian women, difference in hat wear between the sexes does not explain the systematically higher rates of invasive melanoma in men than in women across the various sub-sites of the head and neck with less discrepant rates on the face. (Indeed facial hair cover in men with beards may mitigate the effect of overall higher outdoor exposure of men than women for facial melanomas). We also speculated that younger women’s hair styles may have changed over time and become shorter leading to greater exposure of the ears and neck, but there is little evidence available to address this question.

]. If our general hypothesis is confirmed, hair cover of the ears in particular would add another potential means of melanoma prevention, especially in high-risk populations, among individuals in whom amount of hair cover is discretionary.
