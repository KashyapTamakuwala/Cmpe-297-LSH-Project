Our findings provide preliminary evidence that increased disease severity, longer duration of disease, and younger age of onset of kidney disease potentially place children with CKD at increased risk of neurocognitive deficits. Additional investigation is required to better quantify these risk factors, particularly regarding how much variability is accounted for by these specific risk factors.

] examined the long-term outcomes of children diagnosed with CKD and identified persistent difficulties with a limited knowledge base, memory, and concentration into adulthood, as well as lower educational attainment. A better understanding of potential risk factors for cognitive impairment and decline in the pediatric CKD population could allow for earlier intervention and, possibly, less morbidity, particularly for certain cognitive deficiencies.

]. The measures of cognitive performance in each of these studies varied widely but, when viewed collectively, suggest that children with CKD are vulnerable to cognitive deficiencies in IQ, memory and attention.
One thing to note, however, is that most studies to date have focused primarily on children with ESRD, leaving unanswered whether children with mild to moderate CKD also suffer this same vulnerability. Cognitive deficiencies in children with CKD could arise through a gradual process, proportional to the level of kidney dysfunction, or may develop once a filtration threshold has been passed. It seems logical that the severity of CKD might be proportional to the degree of cognitive impairment, but the data are not yet available to support this. The stage of neurologic development at the time of disease onset or the cumulative time children spend with CKD may also impact on the degree or type of cognitive impairment experienced. To our knowledge, no published study has yet focused specifically on isolating risk factors to identify which children with CKD are most at risk for cognitive decline. The primary goal of this study was to explore associations between clinical aspects describing CKD and selected neurocognitive test scores in a sample of children and adolescents with CKD. In addition, this study should provide the foundation for identifying specific clinical risk factors for subsequent neurodevelopmental dysfunction.

 body surface area for at least 3 months duration. Renal transplant recipients and children with profound developmental delays were excluded. Following parental consent and patient assent, 29 children meeting these criteria underwent neurocognitive testing at a single point in time. A standardized physical examination and laboratory sample collection were also performed within 2 weeks of cognitive testing. A questionnaire providing demographic and historic information was completed by a parent or legal guardian. The study was reviewed and approved by the University of North Carolina Institutional Review Board.

In all instances, higher scores represented higher function for each cognitive test result. All tasks were administered by trained examiners who were supervised by a child neuropsychologist.

]. For this study, the vigilance task was administered, which requires the individual to respond to specific visual stimuli (e.g., the number 1 followed by the number 9) from a series of numbers presented at a rate of approximately one per second. This task yields standard scores for the number correct, correct variability, commissions, and commission variability. For this study, the total correct standard score was employed.

]. It includes nine different subtests that measure short-term verbal memory (story memory, sentence memory, number/letter), short-term visual memory (picture memory, design memory, finger windows), and new learning capabilities (sound symbol, visual learning, verbal learning). A general memory index is also computed from the nine subtests. Normative data are available for ages 6 through 18 years. The WRAML was administered and scored according to standardized procedures, with the general memory index being employed for this study.

Clinical measures
Disease severity, age of onset, and duration of renal disease, coded as time in years and as percent of life with CKD, as well as the presence of anemia or hypertension were explored as potential risk factors of interest, given their association with detrimental cognitive outcomes in the CKD literature. Clinical data were collected through physical examinations and laboratory tests performed within 2 weeks of cognitive testing. Age of disease onset, as well as duration and percent of life with CKD, were determined through record reviews and were based on the date of primary disease diagnosis.

Results
An initial inspection of the neurocognitive test scores showed that the sample of children and adolescents with CKD was mildly variable, with most of the participants falling within the low average to average range on most tasks. For the full study sample, the mean IQ score was 91 (range 61 to 117, SD 16), and the mean memory score was 88 (range 65 to 128, SD 16), both falling within the low average to average range when compared with normative expectations. The mean attention score of 96 fell well within the average range but did show much more variability (range 37 to 120, SD 23).

 = 0.01). However, this must be interpreted with caution, since only three participants fulfilled this criterion for anemia.
We should also acknowledge that there is a high degree of correlation among the results of the individual cognitive domains tested. Among the children included in our study, 12 (41%) had no cognitive scores greater than one standard deviation below the normative mean of 100, eight (28%) deviated in this fashion in a single cognitive domain, three (10%) did so in two areas, and six (21%) did so in all three areas. The level of overlap is, in part, likely due to the nature of cognitive testing, whereby testing in one area is, to some degree, dependent upon function in another area. The fact that there is not complete overlap, however, indicates that cognitive testing can distinguish among these deficits with some level of specificity.


Discussion
Neurocognitive deficits among children with ESRD have been demonstrated in the literature, with some suggestion that key clinical variables can be associated with the level and, perhaps, the pattern of these deficits. The primary purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between targeted clinical variables, based on the available literature, and selected neurocognitive functions as defined by IQ, memory, and attention. Further, the current study examines these relationships across the full spectrum of CKD, including the mild to moderate stages of CKD. While it is recognized that some of the etiologies leading to CKD in our patients, namely cystinosis, calcineurin inhibitor toxicity, and ischemic injury, could potentially be independently associated with some level of cognitive dysfunction, in all three cases the children did not demonstrate evidence of other neurologic signs that would indicate central nervous system damage from their underlying disorders. Additionally, these children are representative of a typical pediatric CKD population, and any contribution from the presence of their comorbid conditions would not compromise the validity of our findings.

], in which children with renal disease had scores that included some in the average range but still had mean IQ and achievement scores significantly lower than their healthy sibling controls. These findings support the hypothesis that disease severity plays a strong role in predicting neurocognitive vulnerability, yet also suggest that there might be additional contributing variables characterizing end stage disease that warrant further investigation. In an effort to explore this issue further, the sub-analysis confined to the relationship between disease severity and cognitive outcomes in the non-dialysis participants demonstrated a more subtle downward trend of scores across all cognitive domains that did not reach statistical significance. This was likely, in part, due to the reduction in power resulting from our limiting the analysis to only 15 participants. It also might suggest that therapy with dialysis itself contributes to cognitive dysfunction.
The literature has been more ambiguous with regard to attention, and our findings did not demonstrate a significant deficit in attention. Our sample did, however, demonstrate significantly more variation in the attention measure among children with CKD than one would anticipate in the general population, as exhibited by the large standard deviation in our study sample. This suggests the possibility that there may be a subset of children with CKD who are more vulnerable to attention-related problems. More extensive exploration of the various components of attention may be required to explore this observation further.

] showed that hypertension was significantly associated with lower neurocognitive scores representative of short-term memory, attention and concentration problems. In our study sample of children with CKD, the majority of our participants were on antihypertensive therapy, so any existing hypertension in our study sample was at least partially treated, thus significantly restricting the range of variance available for correlation analysis. Furthermore, some antihypertensive therapies, for instance clonidine, have the potential to cause sedating effects in children but can actually help concentration in other children. The effects of medications on just a few children could appear amplified in our small study sample, and, thus, a true relationship could be obscured.

] used erythropoietin in 24 adult hemodialysis patients to improve their average hematocrit from 23% to 36%, resulting in significantly improved neuropsychological test scores reflecting memory, learning and attention. In our study sample of children with CKD, only three children had a low hemoglobin level, and these were between 10.1 mg/dl and 10.8 mg/dl. The mean scores for memory and attention among those three children were 8 points and 22 points lower, respectively, than those for non-anemic children, suggesting that there could be a relationship that would require a larger sample size to identify. In the normal or near-normal range, detrimental effects of lower hemoglobin levels are likely more subtle and, thus, less likely to be captured in analysis of a small sample. Our time-averaged hemoglobin analysis supported this as well.
This is the first study to date that focuses specifically on identifying potential risk factors for neurocognitive decline in children and adolescents with CKD. Its value is further enhanced by the inclusion of children with mild to moderate CKD, thus extending findings to a wider range of pediatric CKD patients. Increased disease severity, duration of CKD, and younger age at CKD onset were identified as potential risk factors for the targeted neuropsychological functions of IQ and memory. Our results further suggest a significant linear relationship with disease severity, with IQ scores continuously declining as disease severity worsens. Not only does this finding argue against a threshold effect, it implicates disease severity as an important risk factor for neuropsychological dysfunction. These findings also suggest the possible utility of these variables in a cumulative risk model to predict neurocognitive dysfunction in CKD and lay the foundation for exploration of such a model. Finally, these findings emphasize the importance of conducting further research in neurocognitive development among children with CKD. This includes research both to more clearly predict which children with CKD are most vulnerable to neuropsychological dysfunction and to identify specific correlates of this dysfunction. While there have been great strides in improving quality and length of life among children with CKD, a better understanding of those processes that interfere with normal neurodevelopment is a critical element of providing optimal care to these children.
