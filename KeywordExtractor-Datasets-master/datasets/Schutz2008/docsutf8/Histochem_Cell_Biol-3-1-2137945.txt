Trafficking of proteins and RNAs is essential for cellular function and homeostasis. While it has long been appreciated that proteins and RNAs move within cells, only recently has it become possible to visualize trafficking events in vivo. Analysis of protein and RNA motion within the cell nucleus have been particularly intriguing as they have revealed an unanticipated degree of dynamics within the organelle. These methods have revealed that the intranuclear trafficking occurs largely by energy-independent mechanisms and is driven by diffusion. RNA molecules and non-DNA binding proteins undergo constrained diffusion, largely limited by the spatial constraint imposed by chromatin, and chromatin binding proteins move by a stop-and-go mechanism where their free diffusion is interrupted by random association with the chromatin fiber. The ability and mode of motion of proteins and RNAs has implications for how they find nuclear targets on chromatin and in nuclear subcompartments and how macromolecular complexes are assembled in vivo. Most importantly, the dynamic nature of proteins and RNAs is emerging as a means to control physiological cellular responses and pathways.

A key question in understanding nuclear architecture is how protein and RNAs move within the nucleus. This is a key issue if we are to gain a full appreciation of what the nuclear environment is like. More importantly, the mode of nuclear motion of molecules has physiological implications as it affects how proteins find their target sequences in the genome, how RNAs are exported from the nucleus upon transcription and how proteins are sequestered within the nucleus for regulatory purposes. Some initial insights into these issues are summarized in broad terms here.

 are similar to those observed in the cytoplasm and are only ∼5 times less than that in solution. As expected for diffusion, this rapid motion is energy-independent and non-directional.

). These studies show that RNAs synthesized from genes positioned in proximity to the nuclear envelope diffuse away from their site of synthesis in all directions rather than follow a direct path to the nearest nuclear pore. This observation powerfully demonstrates the non-directed, diffusion-based motion of RNAs in the nucleus.

Trafficking as a means of targeting
2001
). The power of targeting by random diffusion within the nucleus is best illustrated when considering how a transcription factor finds its target genes but it also applies to targeting of proteins to nuclear compartments or any other nuclear site.
2001
). This occurs by a transcription factor freely diffusing within the nucleoplasm until it interacts by chance with chromatin. The molecule will now probe whether the sequence it has encountered is a specific binding site such as in the promoter of one of its target genes. If it is, the transcription factor will be captured and stably associated with its specific target site. If the sequence is not a binding site, the molecule, after a short interaction, will dissociate from chromatin and continue its diffusional journey through the nucleus.
2006
1999
2000
2004
2006

). Since proteins similarly move by diffusional motion within the cytoplasm, it stands to reason that the random scanning is also a key mechanism of protein targeting in the cytoplasm and represents a universal mechanism for how proteins find their targets.
2006
2004
2006
). The transient nature of protein–chromatin interactions is important for three reasons. First, it allows proteins to maintain a high rate of motion and thus allows faster scanning. Were protein–chromatin interactions static, they would get stuck at non-specific or incorrect binding sites which would slow down their overall motion. Second, the short-life of protein–chromatin interactions continuously makes available binding sites which can then be scanned by diffusing transcription factors. If proteins interacted for extended periods of time on chromatin, non-specific or improper binding would block access of the correct factors. Third, the dynamic dissociation allows for change. Were protein complexes permanently bound to their target sites, changes in transcriptional activity such as in response to physiological stimuli could only occur after active removal of the bound complex, presumably by dedicated and specialized molecular machinery. In contrast, in a dynamic binding model the natural flux of proteins provides a window of opportunity for association of a distinct regulator each time a bound protein or complex dissociates as part of its normal binding cycle.

). Typical residence times of proteins within a compartment are in the seconds range. In practical terms the dynamic behavior of nuclear body proteins means that they undergo repeated rapid cycles of association and dissociation between the nuclear body and the nucleoplasm. As a consequence, a nuclear body is in perpetual flux and its structure is determined by the ratio of on-rate versus off-rate of its proteins.
2006
2007
). In this model, nuclear bodies are essentially dynamic protein aggregates which form as a consequence of multiple, transient interactions amongst a large number of proteins. This is consistent with the lack of defining intranuclear membranes and with the absence of any known dedicated structural elements within intranuclear bodies. While dynamic observations on nucleoli, splicing factor compartments and Cajal bodies support this view, this model has not been rigorously tested experimentally. A key prediction, and a way to experimentally address this fundamental question, is that it should be possible to create nuclear bodies de novo and that any nuclear body component should be able to nucleate the formation of a body. Experimental systems to test these predictions are now available, and we are eagerly awaiting the results of these key experiments.

The importance of protein and RNA dynamics in regulatory events
The observation of dynamic properties of proteins in the cell nucleus of living cells has suggested that dynamic trafficking is an intrinsic property of proteins and RNAs. The dynamic behavior of proteins and RNAs clearly contributes to their proper function. However, is dynamic trafficking important for physiological regulation? Several observations demonstrate that dynamic trafficking of both proteins and RNA indeed can have regulatory function by several means.

Conclusions
The past few years have seen a dramatic change in how we view the cell nucleus. We have come to appreciate the presence of distinct structural elements within the nucleus, the presence of a multitude of intranuclear bodies and the fact that genomes are non-randomly organized within the nuclear space. One of the most consequential findings has been the realization that just about every aspect of nuclear organization is highly dynamic. Both proteins and RNAs move rapidly within the nucleus, and they only transiently interact with chromatin and nuclear bodies. It is now clear that the dynamic nature of nuclear components is a fundamental property and has implications for how molecules are targeted to their final destinations and for how intranuclear compartments form. Most importantly, it is becoming clear that the dynamic properties of nuclear proteins are critical for various mechanisms of physiological regulation, particularly via sequestration and retention of proteins and RNA. It is likely that these recently discovered examples of regulation by modulation of dynamic interactions within the cell nucleus are only the proverbial tip of the iceberg, and it stands to reason that we should consider the contribution of dynamic interactions and trafficking in any nuclear event we investigate in the future.
