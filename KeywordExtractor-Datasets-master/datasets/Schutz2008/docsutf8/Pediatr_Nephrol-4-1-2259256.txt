A review of the various causes of neurologic impairment to the lower urinary tract in children was the aim of this presentation. The emphasis was on diagnosis, pathophysiology, and treatment that strive to maintain as normal a function as possible in order to achieve eventual urinary continence and health of the upper urinary tract. The latest principles based on the most up to date evidence are promulgated but with an eye towards historical prospective. The reader should gain an adequate understanding of various disorders that comprise this condition and feel comfortable with proposing options for management when faced with the responsibility of caring for an affected child.

Introduction
Neurogenic bladder dysfunction in children is an ever-evolving condition. The expansion of its understanding and treatment over the past 50 years has been just remarkable. In the mid 1950s there were few insights and minimal alternatives to the child’s being in diapers or wearing an appliance over an abdominal wall stoma. Starting with the development of adequate X-ray assessment and reliable urodynamic investigation, the advent of clean intermittent catheterization, artificial sphincter implantation, continent urinary conduits and a plethora of drug therapies that modulate lower urinary tract function, we have learned a great deal about the pathophysiology, pathogenesis and treatment of this disorder and the evidence specific ways to manage it. With the promise of tissue engineering and stem cell therapy, new vistas for treatment seem to be on the horizon.

Depending on degree of denervation



When vesicoureteral reflux is present, CIC effectively lowers the intravesical emptying pressure when the bladder is drained. In addition, anticholinergic medication can be added to lower detrusor filling pressure, increasing compliance without fear of causing urinary retention when combined with CIC. The lowered filling and emptying pressures has proven to be very beneficial; in 30–50% of children reflux is resolved within 2–3 years of its discovery and initiation of therapy.

25
].
Credé voiding is not an efficacious form of bladder emptying in children with myelodysplasia, especially if the urethral sphincter is partially or fully innervated. Because most children have intact motor function above L1, any increase in abdominal pressure from a Credé maneuver can lead to a reflexive increase in urethral sphincter activity, thus producing an increase in bladder outlet resistance resulting in “high voiding pressure”. This can be particularly noxious in children with moderate or severe grades of reflux. In addition, as the child grows, the bladder resides more in the pelvis and not intra-abdominally, further reducing the effectiveness of the Credé maneuver.
9
26
].
A plethora of surgical procedures has been designed to increase bladder outlet resistance in those children with a level that is insufficient to maintain continence between catheterizations, that include implantation of an artificial urinary sphincter, bladder neck tightening, using adjacent tissue, a fascial sling, and various bulking agents. All can provide more resistance, but no one procedure is ideally suited for every patient.
Creating a catheterizable urinary stoma has become fashionable in those children with intractable urethral incontinence (with obliteration of the bladder neck) or inability to catheterize their urethra easily due to obesity, poor eye–hand coordination or caretaker issues surrounding genital organ privacy. Long-term success has been achieved that provides the individual with a degree of independence, but problems with stomal stenosis can occur.


Occult spinal dysraphism
27
28
]. These lesions include a subcutaneous mass, dermal vascular malformation, hypertrichosis, a midline dimple or sinus tract, a skin tag or an asymmetric gluteal cleft. These lesions often signify an underlying bony and/or spinal cord malformation. Ultrasound within the first 3 months of the infant’s life can easily visualize the intraspinal space. After the infant has reached that age MR imaging is needed to diagnose and/or confirm the presence of a dysraphic state.

33
36
37
]. As noted previously for myelomeningocele in children, a voiding cystourethrogram is warranted only when the urodynamics parameters suggest risk to the upper urinary tract from increased bladder outlet resistance or poor detrusor compliance. Vesicoureteral reflux, hydronephrosis and urinary incontinence are all managed in the same fashion as one would treat children with similar neurologic impairment due to an open spinal abnormality.
33
37
39
]. Therefore, specific urologic therapy is not instituted following delineation of an abnormality in infants until urodynamics studies have been repeated 3 months after the condition has been repaired. If the findings have not changed, or the child is older (when the chance that the neurologic abnormality will not improve), treatment based on principles outlined in the section on open spinal lesions is instituted.

]. Therefore, careful surveillance and repeated assessment at the first sign of incontinence or changing lower extremity function is warranted. No child is considered risk free until he or she has reached full adult height.

]. These findings can vary substantially, from being quite obvious to very subtle, unless a careful neurologic examination is performed. These abnormalities may not be manifest in the early postnatal period, but become evident over time, because myelination of axons and maturation of neurons in the basal ganglia are required before spasticity, dystonia, and athetosis become apparent. Some less affected children have even milder forms of the disease, with only learning disabilities, attention deficit, or attention deficit hyperactivity disorders being seen.

Conclusions
Neurogenic bladder dysfunction in children takes in a very wide spectrum of conditions that include congenitally acquired conditions that may even be preventable today, conditions that are associated with specific anatomic abnormalities, and acquired conditions that may occur perinatally or from accidents or sports or motor vehicle related injuries. Despite the etiology, the guiding principles for management are similar; insuring and maintaining an adequate sized, normally compliant, reservoir that evacuates urine completely, at a relatively low pressure, is the key to maintaining a healthy environment for the kidneys. A plethora of methods has come into existence, especially since the advent of clean intermittent catheterization and the advancement of pharmacologic understanding and manipulation. Future prospects look bright for affected children, with the overall health of the individual the most paramount goal to be achieved.
