Microalbuminuria is an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease and progressive renal impairment. This holds true in the general population and particularly in those with diabetes, in whom it is common and marks out those likely to develop macrovascular disease and progressive renal impairment. Understanding the pathophysiological mechanisms through which microalbuminuria occurs holds the key to designing therapies to arrest its development and prevent these later manifestations.
Microalbuminuria arises from the increased passage of albumin through the glomerular filtration barrier. This requires ultrastructural changes rather than alterations in glomerular pressure or filtration rate alone. Compromise of selective glomerular permeability can be confirmed in early diabetic nephropathy but does not correlate well with reported glomerular structural changes. The loss of systemic endothelial glycocalyx—a protein-rich surface layer on the endothelium—in diabetes suggests that damage to this layer represents this missing link. The epidemiology of microalbuminuria reveals a close association with systemic endothelial dysfunction and with vascular disease, also implicating glomerular endothelial dysfunction in microalbuminuria.
Our understanding of the metabolic and hormonal sequelae of hyperglycaemia is increasing, and we consider these in the context of damage to the glomerular filtration barrier. Reactive oxygen species, inflammatory cytokines and growth factors are key players in this respect. Taken together with the above observations and the presence of generalised endothelial dysfunction, these considerations lead to the conclusion that glomerular endothelial dysfunction, and in particular damage to its glycocalyx, represents the most likely initiating step in diabetic microalbuminuria.

Nearly 20 years on from the Steno hypothesis, the determinants of selective glomerular permeability to proteins at the cellular and molecular level are much better understood. In particular, the importance of podocyte-specific proteins in the regulation of selective permeability has been recognised. Similarly, much is now known about the biochemical derangements important in the pathogenesis of diabetic complications. We draw together these elements to consider the pathophysiological mechanisms through which diabetes exerts its effects on glomerular permeability in the initiating stages of diabetic nephropathy, i.e. at or before the appearance of microalbuminuria. These early changes establish the milieu in which the more advanced changes of overt diabetic nephropathy develop. Defining the mechanistic links from biochemical derangements to the appearance of increased urinary albumin highlights key elements in the pathophysiological pathway of the development of both diabetic nephropathy and micro- and macrovascular disease elsewhere.

]. While other hypotheses have been advanced, for example, failure of tubular reuptake of albumin, none are sufficiently robust to seriously challenge this position.

In both general and diabetic populations, conditions associated with endothelial damage predispose to microalbuminuria

]. Microalbuminuria is associated with several of the disturbances found in the insulin resistance syndrome, including endothelial dysfunction and obesity, in addition to type 2 diabetes. Proinflammatory cytokines produced by visceral adipocytes (adipokines) have recently emerged as important mediators of the increased cardiovascular risk associated with the insulin resistance syndrome. These adipokines represent a possible link from insulin resistance and obesity to microalbuminuria in the non-diabetic population.

Proposed major pathways are represented by red arrows; those of less certain significance by black arrows. The diagram illustrates, for the example, a possible mechanism for the increased risk of microalbuminuria in patients with type 1 diabetes and a susceptibility to insulin resistance. Particularly in type 2 diabetes, other pathways, not directly involving endothelial dysfunction, are likely in the pathogenesis of macrovascular disease and may also contribute to microalbuminuria (broken arrows)

We have already noted that physical alteration of the GFB is necessary to increase its permeability to albumin. Therefore, this confirmation of changes in GFB selective permeability in diabetic microalbuminuria in the absence of clearly identified structural correlates suggests that the key changes are yet to be elucidated. These considerations and the predominance of defects in charge selectivity point to alterations in the negatively charged glomerular endothelial glycocalyx as the missing link. We now move to consider what aspects of the diabetic milieu are responsible for these GFB changes and how they might cause endothelial, including glycocalyx, dysfunction.

Metabolic pathways and effectors from hyperglycaemia to microalbuminuria

Fig. 3
Pathways to microalbuminuria in diabetes. Hyperglycaemia, through increased mitochondrial superoxide production, dysregulates key intracellular metabolic pathways. These in turn lead to the production of effectors that directly cause glomerular endothelial cell (GEnC) dysfunction (particularly of the glycocalyx) and disturb podocyte–endothelial cell communication. This results in microalbuminuria. Progression of these lesions and development of other glomerular changes, including podocyte damage, lead to overt diabetic nephropathy

].
Here we focus on selected intermediaries and effectors that have an identifiable role in microalbuminuria. In large part, dissection of these pathways and elucidation of their role in glomerular disease has necessarily relied on tissue culture or animal models. Such are described where human studies are lacking or where they provide additional significant insights.

]. Adiponectin, unlike other adipokines, appears to have protective effects in the vasculature in general by reducing endothelial cell activation and inflammation.What do these changes in regulation and expression of these mediators tell us about the mechanism of microalbuminuria? It is clear that ROS and oxidative stress have a central role, given their importance in various metabolic pathways and direct cellular effects, including in the disruption of endothelial glycocalyx, which may be relevant in pathogenesis of microalbuminuria. There is strong evidence for a role of VEGF early in the course of diabetic nephropathy, probably through upregulation of production by podocytes and actions on glomerular endothelial cells disrupting their contribution to the GFB. The importance of dysregulation of angiogenic factors is emphasised by the protective effects of angiogenesis inhibitors. The growth hormone/IGF system is also dysregulated early in diabetes, and it appears that IGF-1 is an important contributor to microalbuminuria through VEGF. Involvement of inflammatory mediators again points to a role for glomerular endothelial cells through endothelial activation, and hence, an increase in permeability through disruption of the glycocalyx.

Fig. 4
Proposed mechanism of glomerular filtration barrier damage leading to diabetic microalbuminuria. High glucose causes dysregulation of mediators including TNFα and enhanced production of ROS, which directly damage the glomerular endothelial glycocalyx leading to microalbuminuria. Increased levels of pro-angiogenic molecules, including VEGF and inflammatory mediators, induce an activated and more permeable glomerular endothelial cell phenotype
