Microvascular remodeling is known to depend on cellular interactions with matrix tissue. However, it is difficult to study the role of specific cells or matrix elements in an in vivo setting. The aim of this study is to develop an automated technique that can be employed to obtain and analyze local collagen matrix remodeling by single smooth muscle cells. We combined a motorized microscopic setup and time-lapse video microscopy with a new cross-correlation based image analysis algorithm to enable automated recording of cell-induced matrix reorganization. This method rendered 60–90 single cell studies per experiment, for which collagen deformation over time could be automatically derived. Thus, the current setup offers a tool to systematically study different components active in matrix remodeling.

], and more stable algorithms are required.
While single cell observations provide a more fundamental insight into matrix remodeling than macroscopic studies, a concern is efficiency. Time-lapsed video microscopy of single cells forms a labor-intensive and time-consuming experiment. Meaningful experiments require the comparison of large data sets, including different cell types, various matrix compositions, or the use of biochemical or molecular interventions. A fully automated, motorized microscopy setup is required that scans series of individual cells and their surrounding matrix. In addition, each individual cell should automatically be kept in focus during remodeling experiments, which take up 24 h or more. Finally, stable algorithms are needed for the automated analysis of geometrical reorganization with minimal user input.
The aim of this study is to develop an automated technique that can be employed to obtain and analyze local matrix remodeling by individual cells. The system that we present allows for monitoring of ∼75 cells in parallel, using time-lapse video microscopy and computer-controlled stage positioning. In addition, we present and evaluate a new algorithm for automated detection of collagen matrix deformation around these cells.

Methods
Cell culturing and collagen matrix preparation
Smooth muscle cells, obtained from mesenteric small arteries, were cultured in Leibovitz medium with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. Cells from passages three to nine were used in experiments.

 in the presence of 1 ml serum-free Leibovitz medium. The cells were maintained in an incubation chamber that was set to a temperature of 37°C throughout the experimental procedure. After a stabilization period of about 1 h, cell–matrix interactions were monitored by microscopic imaging for a period of 24 h of spontaneous cell contraction.

Validation of the collagen compaction analysis
Analysis based on cross-correlation of images at a series of decomposition stages was compared with straightforward cross-correlation. This was performed on images simulating matrix compaction, subsequently followed by a challenge of increasing amounts of image noise and artificial translation.

Discussion
This study aimed at developing an automated technique for obtaining and analyzing matrix remodeling by individual cells. Emphasis was put on construction of an automatic, reliable algorithm for assessment of a detailed matrix displacement field. Especially, refinement of a cross-correlation based image analysis with a decomposition scheme was investigated. While “classic” direct CC sufficed for pairs of images with high correlation and low noise, this was no longer the case when substantial matrix remodeling occurred within the time frame between two consecutive images. This resulted in failing of CC at spots of high geometrical reorganization. However, when using decomposition CC, the gross displacements at these positions could be estimated by analysis of parent images with larger dimensions. This way, at a RD increase of 20.2% the average displacement error was lowered threefold in decomposition CC as compared to direct CC.

). When using decomposition CC, on the other hand, the gross displacement was already detected in the first decomposition stage. Displacement values were then adjusted when local compaction was detected in subsequent decomposition stages. Using this strategy, a lack of local correlation at the finest resolution resulted in only a minor displacement error, with an average of 0.9 as compared to 14.6 pixels for direct CC.

. These values were empirically determined as an optimum in the trade-off between calculation time, false positive displacements and overlooking local deformations. Clearly, these choices depend on the contrast and texture of the images and the nature of the deformation, and will need to be optimized for specific future experiments.
