Conclusions
: Women appear to be responding to messages regarding behaviors that directly affect pregnancy such as smoking, alcohol consumption and taking folic acid, but many remain unaware of the benefits of available interventions to prevent HIV transmission and birth defects. Although it appears that some women reduce their risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes after learning of their pregnancy, the data suggest that a substantial proportion of women do not. Furthermore, if such change occurs it is often too late to affect outcomes, such as birth defects resulting from alcohol consumption during the periconception period. Preconception interventions are recommended to achieve a more significant reduction in risk and further improvement in perinatal outcomes.

This paper provides nationally-representative estimates on risks during the preconception period and describes the apparent reductions in risk achieved during pregnancy for all known risk factors for which data are available.

]. Additional technical information is available online at http://www.cdc.gov/brfss/.
The survey includes core modules asked in all states, rotating modules asked every second year in all states, and optional modules that are included only in some states. Being a general survey, the BRFSS lacks information on some factors of interest to the present topic, for example month of pregnancy for pregnant women, or information on prenatal care. Further, the BRFSS is not designed specifically to study all known risk behaviors at preconception or pregnancy. In addition, as an interview survey, the survey relies on self-reported data which contain an unknown level of reporting error.

For example, 53.9% of preconception women reported any use of alcohol in the past month, compared with 10.7% of pregnant women, 19.4% of preconception women reported current smoking in contrast to 8.4% of pregnant women, and, in the 12 states that included the question, 44.8% of preconception women reported not taking vitamins with folic acid versus 19.9% of pregnant women.

Discussion
The 2004 BRFSS provides an opportunity to measure the extent of risk behaviors on a relatively large sample of women who are planning to become pregnant. These nationally-representative survey data indicate that major health risks were reported by substantial proportions of US women in the preconception period. The data suggest that among those at risk during preconception, the majority continued the risk into pregnancy. Women appear to respond to messages regarding behaviors that can improve pregnancy outcomes such as consuming of folic acid, and the reduction in smoking, alcohol consumption, but many remain unaware of the benefits of available interventions to prevent HIV transmission and birth defects. The fact that more than one-third of preconception and pregnant women were not aware of methods to prevent mother-to-child HIV transmission and did not know about the benefits of taking folic acid during pregnancy suggests that education and public information programs could have some effect in reducing risk behaviors.

].
The finding that the percentage who report some risk behaviors is significantly lower among pregnant women compared with women in the preconception period may indicate the desire of many pregnant women to adopt healthier behaviors to achieve the best possible outcome for their pregnancy. Examination of three well known risk factors for which interventions are available (frequent alcohol consumption, current smoking, or never having been tested for HIV) illustrates that risks for adverse pregnancy outcomes exist among more than half of women in the preconception period and among one-third of pregnant women. Nationwide, this represents approximately one million women in the preconception period and 835,000 pregnant women.

]. The preconception and pregnant women identified were distributed very similarly to women giving birth in 2004 by age group and race/ethnicity, providing support for the representativeness of the data. In this report, the reported risk behavior of women in the preconception stage and pregnant women have been compared as a proxy for the type of behavior change occurring between preconception and pregnancy, but other factors could affect the actual change in behavior among individual women.

], it may be feasible to inform them and engage them for interventions. Such contacts may provide an opportunity to assess and advise on many elements of health mentioned here. Our finding of high risk levels among women who had no insurance or no personal doctor strongly suggests that ensuring access to such services will remain the key determinant of maximum uptake of known intervention services. Medicaid and other funding programs can play an important role to address the access gap—whether during, before, or after pregnancy. Attempts to improve the health of would-be mothers not only improve pregnancy and infant health, but also help reduce the long-term impact of many risk factors on the women themselves.
