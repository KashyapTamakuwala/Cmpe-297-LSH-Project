We introduce a novel high resolution scanning surface confocal microscopy technique that enables imaging of endocytic pits in apical membranes of live cells for the first time. The improved topographical resolution of the microscope together with simultaneous fluorescence confocal detection produces pairs of images of cell surfaces sufficient to identify single endocytic pits. Whilst the precise position and size of the pit is detected by the ion conductance microscope, the molecular nature of the pit, e.g. clathrin coated or caveolae, is determined by the corresponding green fluorescent protein fluorescence. Also, for the first time, we showed that flotillin 1 and 2 can be found co-localising with ~200-nm indentations in the cell membrane that supports involvement of this protein in endocytosis.

]. However, TIR is limited to observation of events that occur on the basal cell membrane only since it relies on imaging to a depth of about 100 nm from the glass surface and is not applicable to studying apical cell surfaces. In addition, using fluorescence-based microscopy techniques, it is impossible to determine the precise location of the endocytic pit relative to the cell membrane since the membrane position is hard to define.
On the other hand, electron microscopy techniques have more than sufficient resolution and provide much more detailed information about the surface topography than optical images since the cell membrane can be imaged. However, these require fixation and specialised treatments of the cells, which potentially can alter the structure of interest and are thus incompatible with live studies.

The SCIM scanning head was developed in collaboration with Ionscope Limited, UK and mounted on a Nikon TE2000-U Inverted Microscope (Nikon Co., Japan). The sample holder was attached to a 100-μm HERA XY Nanopositioning System (Physik Instrumente (PI) GmbH & Co., Germany) used for lateral scanning. Vertical measurement and modulation was provided by 12-μm LISA XY Nanopositioning System (Physik Instrumente (PI) GmbH & Co., Germany). Both piezo stages were mounted on 25-mm translation stage DC motors (Physik Instrumente (PI) GmbH & Co., Germany) to provide coarse lateral and vertical approach. The setups were controlled via a computer with a SBC6711 DSP board equipped with A4D4 ADC/DAC modules (Innovative Integration, USA) using SICM software v. 1.2.00 (Ionscope Limited). The time to acquire a 512 × 512 pixel image was approximately 10 min.
Two types of nanopipettes were used for the experiments. For low resolution images, nanopipettes with internal diameters ~150 nm were pulled from borosilicate glass capillaries. High resolution imaging was made using quartz nanopipettes with internal diameters ~70 nm. The nanopipettes were made from 1.00-mm outer diameter by 0.5-mm inner diameter capillaries with inner filament (Sutter Instrument, USA) using a laser-based Brown–Flaming puller (model P-2000, Sutter Instrument, San Rafael, CA, USA).
The nanopipettes, backfilled with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lowered in PBS, produced a resistance of approximately 300 MΩ for quartz and 100 MΩ for borosilicate pipettes. The maximum ion current measured using an Axopatch 200B (Axon Instruments, USA) was ~0.7 nA for quartz and ~1.5 nA for borosilicate pipettes. The set-point for imaging was 1% of the maximum of modulated ion current.
The excitation light source was provided by a GPNT-02 laser diode (532-nm wavelength, IQ1A 635-nm laser; Power Technology Inc., USA). The optical recording system consisted of a Nikon TE2000-U Inverted Microscope equipped with a ×100 1.3-N.A. oil-immersion objective. The excitation light was fed through an epi-fluorescent filter block and emitted light was collected by a photomultiplier with a pinhole (model D-104-814; Photon Technology International, UK).

Image processing and data analysis
Matching VLP topographical structure to its corresponding fluorescent signal was done as follows: fluorescent confocal images were threshold to subtract the background, and the positions of individual fluorescent spots were marked by arrowheads and the multiple spots (where individual signals could not be resolved) circled. All positional markers were then grouped into one template and placed over the simultaneously recorded topographical image. As the result of this procedure, those topographical features having corresponding fluorescent signals were marked.

] resulting in image flattening. A high-pass filter is a filter that passes high frequencies efficiently but reduces frequencies lower than the certain specified (cutoff) frequency. When applied to a 3D image, high-pass filtering results in finer, i.e. high frequency, details to stand out because larger features are eliminated.

] is a type of scanning probe microscopy that uses a glass nanopipette as a sensitive probe to acquire a topographical image of the surface. Distance feedback-control is based on the ion current that flows between electrodes in the nanopipette and the bath, and this current is reduced as the pipette approaches the surface. This allows non-contact imaging of live cells in a physiological buffer.

Scanning surface confocal microscopy
In order to identify what pit indentations detected topographically by SICM corresponded to what endocytic pits, clathrin or caveolin, we transfected Cos-7 cells with corresponding GFP construct and then used scanning surface confocal microscopy to study the transfected cells.

]. SSCM also uses a glass nanopipette to acquire a true topographical image of the surface and a combination of a laser, pinhole and photomultiplier to gather fluorescent information from the cell surface, removing any out-of-focus fluorescence. Because the laser beam is always focused on the very tip of the nanopipette, topographical and fluorescent data are spatially aligned, thus enabling correlation between topographical features and fluorescent signals to be found.

i)], it could be seen that the indentations in the cell surface co-localise with fluorescent signal. However, compared to clathrin-coated pits, identification of caveolae is more problematic. In all experiments conducted, the fluorescent images have a punctate appearance. However, in only two out of 26 experiments did fluorescence and structure co-localise. In those experiments, 139 pits were observed on the cell surface and only 13 of them (9.35%) were identified as matching caveolin-GFP fluorescent signal. This is in good agreement with the previous measurement that 90% of the pits identified in the topographic image on the cell surface are clathrin-coated and indicates that the other 10% are caveolae.

d shows a sequence of three topographical images acquired from the same area of a cell with 10-min intervals. As can be seen, the indentations that correspond to endocytic pits are highly mobile and appear on or disappear from the surface of the cell membrane. It is beyond the current time resolution of our SSCM to follow the dynamics of these pits. However, this is the first time that endocytic pits are resolved topographically on the surface of live cell.


Discussion
By combining high resolution ion conductance imaging of the cell surface topography with fluorescence confocal imaging, we can identify the molecular nature of endocytic pits on the surface of living cells and measure the topography of the pits. For the first time, we showed that flotillin 1 and 2 is involved in the formation of ~200-nm-size indentations in the cell membrane. This observation is important evidence in support of the involvement of this protein in clathrin- and caveolin-independent endocytosis.

]. The sizes of the pits we have measured are in good agreement with those obtained by electron microscopy.
We have also shown that it is possible to apply our method to live cells. The clathrin-coated pits show fast dynamics on the time scale of our current imaging but suggest that improvements in the speed of imaging should allow us to follow the dynamics of endocytic pits on living cells with the intriguing possibility of directly imaging the endocytic process in real time.
