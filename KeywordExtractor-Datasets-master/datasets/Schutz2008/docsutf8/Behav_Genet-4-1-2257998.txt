Statistical power calculations constitute an essential first step in the planning of scientific studies. If sufficient summary statistics are available, power calculations are in principle straightforward and computationally light. In designs, which comprise distinct groups (e.g., MZ & DZ twins), sufficient statistics can be calculated within each group, and analyzed in a multi-group model. However, when the number of possible groups is prohibitively large (say, in the hundreds), power calculations on the basis of the summary statistics become impractical. In that case, researchers may resort to Monte Carlo based power studies, which involve the simulation of hundreds or thousands of replicate samples for each specified set of population parameters. Here we present exact data simulation as a third method of power calculation. Exact data simulation involves a transformation of raw data so that the data fit the hypothesized model exactly. As in power calculation with summary statistics, exact data simulation is computationally light, while the number of groups in the analysis has little bearing on the practicality of the method. The method is applied to three genetic designs for illustrative purposes.

), we wish to bring it to the attention of geneticists since this method of calculating power has general value in the field of genetic modeling. Below, we shortly recapitulate the basics of power analysis, and then outline the procedure of exact simulation, which may be implemented readily (we use the freely available R program). The method is illustrated in three genetic designs. Although we confine ourselves in this paper to illustrations in the context of genetic designs, we stress that this form of simulation can be used for power calculations in a wide range of other designs such as random effects models, growth curve and simplex models, and structural models.

Power calculation
The concept of power is closely related to the two types of statistical errors: the Type I error (i.e., the probability of rejecting a true hypothesis, α), and the Type II error (i.e., the probability of accepting a false hypothesis, β). Power is defined as 1 − β, i.e., the probability of rejecting a false hypothesis, or the probability of not making a Type II error. The basic aim of a power study is to determine the sample size N, which is required to achieve adequate power, given chosen α and a particular effect size.

By comparing the fit of the model including moderator effects on both the means and the variances, to a model in which the moderator only affects the means (say), one can obtain an estimate of non-centrality parameter λ, from which the power to detect the effect of the moderator can be derived.

 statistic. However, how large a sample size should be chosen depends on the study design in question, and very large sample sizes also render the analyses computationally intensive.

Exact data simulation
Power calculations based on sufficient summary statistics are computationally relatively efficient to carry out. However, the actual feasibility of this type of power calculation depends on the number of distinct groups. If the number of groups is large (i.e., >100), it may be more convenient to carry out Monte Carlo based power calculations. We now introduce the concept of exact data simulation, which shares the virtues of the power studies based on summary statistics, but is more practicable given a large number of distinct groups.

The three simulated data sets were subsequently analyzed in Mx. In the Mx-script, we specify different groups for the MZ and DZ twins. Because we use full information maximum likelihood to accommodate the missingness, we do not need to specify different groups for all possible missing data patterns. The Mx command ‘option power’ (α = .05, df = 4) was used to obtain an estimation of the total sample size that would be required for a power of 80%, given the current proportions of subjects in each group.

Although this design allows for the simultaneous modeling of linkage and association, we limit the analysis to the association, but note that linkage information (i.e., IBD sharing estimation) could be included in exact data simulation scripts. For the present illustration, however, we assume that the locus under study is the QTL itself and not a marker in linkage disequilibrium with the QTL.

Conclusion
In this paper we discussed a third method of power calculation, which can be useful when sufficient summary statistics are available in principle, but the number of possible groups is so large to render a multi-group analysis impractical. The illustrations presented in this paper represent only a few of the possible (behavior genetics) designs in which exact data simulation may prove useful. Other models for which exact data simulation can be used include random-effects models, latent growth curve models, simplex models, and (hierarchical) structural models, either or not in the context of genetics, just to name a few. Exact data simulation does not require more programming skills, or programming time, than Monte Carlo simulation, but one may save a lot of time analyzing the simulated data and calculating power, especially when one wishes to construct graphs of power vs. effect size.
In this paper, we used the Mx program to analyze the simulated data because of its inbuilt power calculation function. Another useful option of Mx in this context is the possibility to output individual likelihood statistics for each raw data group. This information can be used to identify the groups that contribute most to the power to detect the effects of interest. Of course, various other statistical software packages (e.g., QTDT, LISREL, MPlus, R) can also be used in combination with exact data simulation to obtain the non-centrality parameters required for power calculations.

), might be approximated by a 5 point or 7 point Likert scale, which would render exact simulation possible in principle (see illustration 2).
Finally we note that the extension of this method to discrete data would obviously be very useful, and does seem feasible.

). In determining the critical value given the choice of α, one would then have to refer to this mixture distribution, rather than to the central χ2(df). To keep things simple, we therefore chose to fix the variance parameter not to zero, but to a value much smaller than the actual value. If this value is not too close to the boundary, the null distribution of the test statistic T is the standard central χ2(df).
