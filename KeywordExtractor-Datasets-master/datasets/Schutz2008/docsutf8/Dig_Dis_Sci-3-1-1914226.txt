Case Report
A 53-year-old man without significant medical history presented with abdominal pain in the left lower quadrant and constipation. He got up that morning with a cramping abdominal ache that lasted over the day. He was nauseous, had vomited once, and ructus was present. There had been a small amount of hard stool and discomfort during defecation initially, but after the general practitioner had administered laxatives, he had liquid diarrhea. There was no complaint of constipation on a regular basis; this was a new finding. Tenesmus was absent. There was no bleeding or mucous discharge. He was feverish, with a temperature of 38.2°C. On examination, the abdomen was slightly distended. Auscultation showed diminished intestinal peristalsis, without borborygmi, and percussion was tympanic. Upon palpation, the abdomen was supple: there was no reflex rigidity nor guarding, and no rebound tenderness. Upon rectal examination, a hard submucosal swelling was palpated 4 cm from the anus, at 3 o’clock, in the left rectum wall. At the time, this was considered an accidental finding that was to be investigated later.

). No normal tissue margins were excised because the tumor was not connected to the surrounding tissues. After surgery, the patient went home and recovered well, without any further complaints or complications.

Conclusion

], and although a number of rectal GISTs have been reported, we have found no cases so far of rectal GIST presenting as a submucosal calculus. Furthermore, in the literature we found no cases of calcified GIST in other sites of the body. Expression of CD117 (c-kit) and CD34 proved that our calculus was in fact a rectal GIST. Calcification might be explained by internal bleeding of the tumor. The abdominal pain of our patient could be explained entirely by the ureteral stone. The rectal tumor might only explain the constipation. Because of the unpredictable biological behavior of gastrointestinal stromal tumors, the prognosis for our patient is uncertain, in spite of the low-risk character. For this reason, at multidisciplinary oncological deliberation, an expectant policy with regular follow-up was arranged.
