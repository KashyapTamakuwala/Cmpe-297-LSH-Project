 transcription/translation reaction. However, no stimulation of specific activity was observed when chaperones were added directly to purified I278T indicating that the presence of chemical chaperones is required during translation. We also found that by mixing different chaperones we could achieve rescue at significantly lower chaperone concentrations. Taken together, our data show that chemical chaperones present during the initial folding process can facilitate proper folding of several mutant CBS proteins and suggest it may be possible to treat some inborn errors of metabolism with agents that enhance proper protein folding.

 via interaction of mutant CBS with a small molecule (i.e. drug). In order to pursue this possibility, we developed a simple yeast assay utilizing yeast expressing human I278T to screen for compounds that could rescue the growth defect. Surprisingly, we discovered in the process of library screening that the solvent compound dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) by itself could rescue the I278T mutant. The work described here expands on this serendipitous discovery.

 followed by a 1/30,000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary anti-body (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA, USA). Signal was detected by chemiluminescence using SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Amersham) and Chemigenius station (Syngene); signal was quantitated by GeneSnap software. For SDS-gels identical conditions were used with the exception of the presence of 3% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) in the extraction buffer, 10 min heating at 100 °C prior loading and the presence of SDS in the electrophoresis running buffer.

, we first determined the amount of CBS protein by densitometry using Alpha Ease™ image analysis software. We then normalized all enzyme activity to the wild-type enzyme by multiplying the enzyme activity by the amount of CBS in the wild-type untreated sample divided by the amount in each treated sample.

 of 1.25 for WT. Interestingly, there appeared to be a lag in the growth of I278T compared to WT. At 24 h there was only minimal stimulation of I278T growth, while WT had already reached saturation. We also found that high concentrations of DMSO (1.28 M) appeared to be toxic to both I278T and WT yeast. We failed to observe any rescue in CBS-null yeast cells (data not shown). These experiments show that DMSO can significantly rescue the cysteine auxotrophy of I278T expressing yeast and suggest that DMSO can somehow restore function to mutant human CBS.

Chemical chaperone rescue of I278T and other missense mutations
[23]
N
Fig. 2
, all four of these compounds rescued growth of I278T significantly after 40 h, with the greatest amount of rescue occurring with TMAO and proline. Interestingly, all of the chaperones when given at high concentrations resulted in growth inhibition of yeast expressing wild-type CBS, indicating that chemical chaperones may adversely affect normal proteins.
[19]
Fig. 2
, the mutants fell into three classes. One class of mutations including N228S, G307S, D376N, and Q526K, were not rescuable by any of the chemical chaperones. A second class consisting of I278T, T262M, and T353M all showed significant rescue with all five chaperones tested. The third class contained a single member, A226T, and was characterized by exhibiting slight rescue with TMAO and proline, but not glycerol, DMSO, or sorbitol. From these studies we concluded that some, but not all, disease causing CBS alleles can have their residual enzyme activity enhanced by the addition of chemical chaperones. In addition, certain mutations can show chaperone specificity.

Chaperone mixtures

 reaching 60% of the strain expressing wild-type human CBS. These findings show that combinations of different chaperones may be more effective than individual chaperones in promoting rescue of I278T CBS.

Predicted change in solvent accessible surface area predicts chemical chaperone rescue
[24]
Table 1
, five mutations would be predicted to cause an increase in mean ASA, while three changes would be predicted to cause a decrease in mean ASA. Interestingly, all three of the mutations causing a net decrease in mean ASA are rescuable by all four chemical chaperones tested, while the five mutations that result in increased ASA are not universally rescuable. These findings suggest that chemical chaperones may be most effective in restoring function to missense mutations that result in amino acids becoming more buried in the protein.

Chemical chaperones cause enhancement of specific activity and tetramer formation of mutant CBS
S. cerevisiae
Fig. 4
a, neither glycerol nor DMSO had a substantial effect on either wild-type CBS protein or activity, although Mixture 3 did cause a twofold increase in activity and the appearance of higher ordered multimers on native gels. In contrast, exposure of I278T expressing yeast to chemical chaperones resulted in a dramatic effect on CBS protein and activity. In the absence of chemical chaperones we found that cell extract from yeast expressing I278T had about 4% activity compared to yeast expressing WT CBS and almost no detectable tetramers. When chaperones were added to these cells we observed a large increase in both enzyme activity and the amount of tetramer. As expected, the most effective treatment was Mixture 3, resulting in an eightfold increase in CBS activity. Interestingly, this chaperone mixture promoted the formation of not just tetramers, but higher order multimers as well. From these results we conclude that yeast expressing I278T CBS in the presence of chemical chaperones had higher steady-state levels of CBS protein accompanied by an even larger increase in the amount of tetramer protein, resulting in increased CBS activity.
Fig. 4
b, growth in TMAO resulted in increased tetramer content in all of the mutants. However, increased enzyme activity was only associated with four of the mutations, T262M, T353M, A226T, and N228S. From this result we conclude that chemical chaperones such as TMAO can promote proper protein folding and tetramer formation from a variety of different missense mutations. However, our data also show that although all of the missense mutations appear to affect tetramer formation, restoration of tetramers is not always sufficient to restore enzyme activity.

Chaperone effect requires protein folding and is not a phenomena of S. cerevisiae

E. coli
 grown in 8% glycerol had a fourfold increase in specific activity compared to the enzyme isolated from cells grown in normal media (data not shown). From these experiments, we conclude that chemical chaperones can enhance I278T activity if they are present at the time of initial protein synthesis and production.

. The current view of these findings is that the second site suppressors act by increasing protein stability and thus counteracting the effect of the original destabilizing mutation. In this study, we found a perfect correlation between mutations that were suppressible by chemical chaperones and mutations that were suppressible by truncation of the C-terminal regulatory domain. A hypothesis to explain this finding is that the C-terminal domain of CBS is a destabilizing influence and can promote misfolding of the catalytic domain when certain missense mutations are present. Absence of (or mutations in) the C-terminal domain reduce this destabilizing effect such that the catalytic domain can now fold properly. Similarly, chemical chaperones may increase the stability of the full length protein allowing proper folding and activity.

 sufficient to promote alternative folding of mutant CBS proteins and stimulate residual CBS activity. Future studies using CBS-deficient mouse models should be undertaken to test this hypothesis.
