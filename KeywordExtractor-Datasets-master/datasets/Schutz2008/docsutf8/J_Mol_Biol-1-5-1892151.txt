In all three examples, and also with all of the other Type IIB enzymes examined here apart from AloI (data not shown), their reactions yielded none of the OC form of the DNA that would have arisen if products cut in one strand, at one or both sites, had accumulated during the reaction. A SC DNA with two recognition sites for a Type IIB enzyme has eight scissile phosphodiester bonds, in top and bottom strands on either side of both sites. Cleavage of any one of these eight bonds will convert the SC to the OC form but if the next phosphodiester bond to be cleaved is chosen at random from the seven remaining targets, six out of the seven leave the DNA in its OC state and only one, that opposite the initial nick, will result in the OC form being converted to the linear product with one double-strand break. Hence, Type IIB enzymes might be expected to generate large amounts of the OC intermediate before creating any linear product. The observation that no OC DNA accumulated shows instead that, after cutting one strand at a single locus, Type IIB enzymes must cut the second strand at that locus very shortly thereafter, within the lifetime of a single DNA–enzyme complex.

16,24,33

 Several other Type IIB enzymes also converted major fractions of their two-site substrates directly to the final products with double-strand breaks at both sites, liberating none of the OC and only small amounts of the FLL intermediate: they included FalI, PpiI and PsrI (data not shown). AlfI and the other Type IIB enzymes that act in this manner therefore fall into the Type IIF category.
Figure 5
17,57

 AloI, BaeI and BsaXI also cleaved their two-site substrates to give first the FLL linear form, again to a maximal yield of ∼40% of the total, and only later the linear fragments with double-strand breaks at both sites. Though these enzymes all need to bind two copies of their recognition sites to become fully active, they cleave each site in separate reactions.

in cis,
 as the juxtaposition of the sites in the catenane will not impose any deformation of the intervening DNA. The enzyme may therefore be able to cut both sites within the lifetime of the catenane synapse but not within the lifetime of the plasmid synapse.
Table 3
Figure 5
Figure 1
(b)), both BaeI and CspCI cleaved the catenanes much more concertedly than the plasmids: they released almost none of the individual circles from cutting the catenane in a single ring. Hence, both BaeI and CspCI act rapidly on DNA with two copies of their recognition sites by first spanning the sites through 3-D space, as opposed to tracking along the DNA. They can then act concertedly at both sites. BaeI and CspCI thus also belong in the Type IIF category of restriction endonucleases.

 have been described. Specifically, pDG5 had been constructed from pMLE1 by inserting a 56 bp duplex that contained the same sequence as that around the BcgI site in pUC19: pDG5 is thus a 3806 bp plasmid with two BcgI sites 1810 bp apart that are identical to each other and to that in pUC19.

 HB101 and the plasmids from several transformants sequenced across the site of the insertion (University of Dundee Sequencing Service). From each ligation, some transformants were found to contain a plasmid with a single copy of the insert at the requisite site. These plasmids were then used as vectors to clone a second duplex at a separate site, to give plasmids with two inserts in either inverted or directly repeated orientation. The constructs with inverted (head-to-head) inserts were used as the two-site substrates.

24,32,38

 In some instances, reactions were carried out in 20 μl volumes containing constant amounts of enzyme and plasmid but with varied concentrations of an oligoduplex: some duplexes contained, others lacked, the recognition sequence for the test enzyme. After a fixed time interval, these reactions were quenched with Stop-Mix as described above.

7,33–35

 Type IIB enzymes cleave DNA on both sides of their recognition sites, but the linear product from cutting on one side of a site is only 27– 33 bp longer than that cleaved on both sides of the same site. As the plasmids used here were ∼4 kb in size, with ∼1 kb between the sites in the two-site substrates, the products from bilateral cleavages were not separated from those with unilateral cleavages. Moreover, the 27–33 bp fragments excised from the remainder of the DNA were too small to detect on the agarose gels used here. It was assumed that DNA products cut in both strands at one or both recognition sites had been cleaved bilaterally at those sites.

 Further experiments using BcgI that had been purified in this laboratory (S. Ganguly, S. Milsom, J.J.T.M & S.E.H., unpublished results) show that all of the BcgI reactions described here contained enzyme in excess of the substrate. It has yet to be determined which of these two possibilities apply to the other Type IIB enzymes that give exponential curves, as their concentrations were known only in terms of enzyme units, not molarities. On the other hand, a linear decline in [S] can only arise from a zero-order steady-state reaction involving multiple turnovers of the enzyme. Consequently, to permit comparisons of different enzymes, all of the reaction rates were evaluated as zero-order velocities from the decline in [S] with time over the initial portion of the reaction.

All of the Type IIB restriction endonucleases analysed here are listed, with the bacterial species from which they were originally isolated.


a
In the recognition sequences, the pairs of numbers either side of the nucleotide sequence shown indicate the number of bases between the specified sequence and the point of cleavage, firstly in the strand shown, secondly in the complementary strand. N denotes any base and Y a pyrimidine.


b
The length of the DNA fragment that the nuclease excises from its substrate is given as the number of bases in each strand.


c
Whenever known (– indicates not known), the number of different polypeptide chains is as shown: for two-polypeptide systems, the ratio is given.


V
Indicates that these particular enzymes can cleave at varied positions that differ from the canonical by 1 or 2 bp.

Site separations correspond to the shorter of the two centre-to-centre distances in the circular plasmid.


d
Three or more repeats of each reaction were carried out and a mean value calculated for the concentration of supercoiled DNA substrate at each individual time point. The mean values were fitted to a linear slope to give the initial rates shown. Errors on the rates indicate standard errors from the fitting procedure. Compound errors are recorded for the ratios of the rates.
