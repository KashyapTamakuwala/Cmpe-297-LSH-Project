 can be determined by the use of alternative techniques, the remaining parameters are generally of greater interest. We would like to stress, however, that we are not suggesting the two-pool model is an exact representation of the distribution of macromolecular pools or of their exchange. We simply report that all of these relatively simple signal equations appear to be able to provide consistent and practical information which might be useful in a clinical/clinical research context. Although we did not directly compare the sensitivity of different signal equations to changes similar to those caused by pathology, we have attempted to provide useful guidelines to the choice of the most appropriate one for a particular experimental setting.

-weighting in the acquisition sequence (as a consequence of saturation from the excitation pulse), suggesting that, in the absence of this confounding factor, the CW variant can be used without major disadvantages, given its reduced complexity. It should be noted, however, that we used a single set of MT parameters to create the simulations, without any attempt to explore the consistency of these results for a different type of tissue (e.g. gray matter). Our results, therefore, are limited to this specific case until confirmed by further experiments.

. This analysis would be complementary to the investigation of duty cycle effects we performed, and may confirm whether the relative insensitivity of Sled and Pike’s CW approximation to duty cycle is maintained for all pulse sequences.
Furthermore, it would be interesting to explore possible modifications of Ramani’s equation to account for the imaging parameters of the pulse sequence (for example by incorporating an additional contribution of [1-cos(alpha)]/TR to the CW saturation rate acting on the free pool). Finally, providing reliable information about the optimal number of sampling points and their distribution would yield an additional element towards the choice of the most appropriate equation for a given application. All these areas deserve further investigation, which we hope to pursue in the future.
