The objectives of this study are: (1) to understand the importance of nutrition in normal growth; (2) to review the methods of assessing nutritional status; (3) to review the dietary requirements of normal children throughout childhood, including protein, energy, vitamins and minerals; (4) to review recommendations for the nutritional requirements of children with chronic renal failure (CRF) and on dialysis; (5) to review reports of spontaneous nutritional intake in children with CRF and on dialysis; (6) to review the epidemiology of nutritional disturbances in renal disease, including height, weight and body composition; (7) to review the pathological mechanisms underlying poor appetite, abnormal metabolic rate and endocrine disturbances in renal disease; (8) to review the evidence for the benefit of dietetic input, dietary supplementation, nasogastric and gastrostomy feeds and intradialytic nutrition; (9) to review the effect of dialysis adequacy on nutrition; (10) to review the effect of nutrition on outcome.

]. It must be borne in mind that BMI does not distinguish between fat mass and fat-free mass (FFM) and an appropriate BMI for age (whether height age or chronological age) does not necessarily indicate ideal body composition; weight gain may be due to the laying down of excess fat rather than a balance of fat and lean tissue.

]. However, both are rather unreliable tools because consistent measurements are difficult, values may not be representative of visceral fat and fat or muscle mass, oedema will influence values, regional fat and muscle distribution may be different in CRF and values vary according to age in normal children.

Nutritional requirements for normal children
Recommended daily amounts (RDA) and recommended intakes (RI) for energy, protein and nutrients vary between countries. Regardless of the national dietary recommendations that are used it is important to consider that these are estimates of requirements for normal healthy populations of people and are not recommendations for absolute intakes for individuals. They serve as a guide for the energy and nutrients that an individual may require for normal growth, maintenance, development and activity. Requirements for any particular nutrient will differ between individuals.

] are for infants fed artificial formulas and for older infants, children and adults consuming food. DRVs are not set for breast-fed babies, as it is considered that human milk provides the necessary amounts of nutrients. In some cases the DRVs for infants aged up to 3 months who are formula-fed are in excess of those which would be expected to derive from breast milk; this is because of the different bioavailability of some nutrients from breast and artificial milk.
The DRV for energy intake is assumed to be normally distributed and is expressed as the estimated average requirement (EAR). For protein and other nutrients, requirements are expressed as reference nutrient intakes (RNI), set at 2 SDs above the average. Therefore, intakes of protein and nutrients above this amount will almost certainly be adequate for all individuals in a population. For some nutrients where there is insufficient data to establish DRVs with great confidence safe intakes are set—a level or range of intake at which there is no risk of deficiency.

In conclusion
, commencement of careful nutritional support early in the course of disease may improve not only growth but also mortality in children of all ages with CRF.

Multiple choice questions
(Answers appear following the reference list)
true
false
Rate of growth is highest during prenatal life

50% of final height is achieved by the age of 2 years

The infantile phase of growth is principally dependent on growth hormone

Growth rate stays the same throughout the childhood phase of growth

A pubertal growth spurt can occur without the development of secondary sexual characteristics




It may be more appropriate to express measures of growth according to height age rather than chronological age

The height standard deviation score (HtSDS) is the number of standard deviations from the mean for a normal population of the same age and sex

2
 and indicates the proportion of fat mass to fat free mass

Low serum albumin is always an indication of malnutrition

Peritonealprotein losses in dialysate are twofold greater in relation to body surface area in infants than in those >50 kg in weight




The estimated protein requirement for a normal healthy 30-week-old girl weighing 6.0 kg (0.4th centile) and 59.0 cm in length (<0.4th centile) is >2.1 g/kg/day

Her estimated energy requirement is 150 cal/kg/day

The prescribed dietary protein intake for the same child on PD would be 2.8–3.0 g/kg/day

Children with CRF or on dialysis need a calorie intake that exceeds the EAR for height age

Supplements of vitamin A are necessary in children on dialysis




Abnormal taste sensation can occur in CRF and on dialysis

Leptin is produced by adipocytes and levels are high in CRF and on dialysis

High leptin levels cause an increase in food intake and metabolic rate

GH levels are normal or high and IGF-1 levels are low in CRF

GH levels are normal or high and IGF-1 levels are low in malnutrition




Salt restriction is important in all children with CRF

Nutritional supplementation has not been shown to benefit children over two years of age

Increasing dialysis dose in PD may increase peritoneal dialysate protein losses and contribute to obesity

Sodium supplementation may be necessary in children on PD

Gastrostomy placement is preferable before PD commences
