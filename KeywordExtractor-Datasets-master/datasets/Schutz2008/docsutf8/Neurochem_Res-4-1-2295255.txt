The cause of influenza to the brain was investigated using the A/NWS/33 influenza virus infected BALB/c mouse model. NOS-2 mRNA levels in the infected mouse brain was greater than in control mice in all brain regions examined, particularly in the olfactory bulb and hippocampus by 1 day p.i. On the contrary, no differences in NOS-1 or NOS-3 mRNA levels were found between infected and control mice. There was also a marked increase in the levels of metabolites of nitric oxide in the olfactory bulb and hippocampus. Immunohistochemistry showed positive staining for anti-NOS-2 primarily in the hippocampus of infected mice. Further, anti-NOS-2 and GFAP staining was mostly found around capillary blood vessels of the hippocampus starting early in the course of the disease. These results indicate that the NWS enhances the activation of astrocytes and NOS-2 expression which in turn enhances NO production and the expansion of capillary blood vessels.

]. Moreover, Ino et al. studied five autopsies cases of IE patients. They reported that four out of the five patients showed degenerated astrocytic spines in the cortex, by glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) staining. They suspected that the IE was largely due to these altered glial cells (Ino et al. unpublished).
Taken together, it is likely that IE is related to both the influence of NO and glial cells changes. Nevertheless, there have been no reports on a relationship between NOS-2 and glial cells within the brain after infection with the influenza virus. Thus, the aim of these studies is to better understand the clinical state of IE by focusing on NO and astrocytes in the central nervous system (CNS) after influenza virus infection. By using the A/NWS/33 influenza virus infected BALB/c model mouse, we were able to demonstrate that influenza virus infection leads to an up regulation of NOS-2 and astrocytes, mostly around capillary blood vessels of the hippocampus and olfactory bulb, starting at an early stage of the disease.
Although IE has been reported for more than a decade, a therapy for IE has not yet been defined. We expect that our results will provide evidence which will aid in the development of a novel IE therapy.

Experimental procedures
Virus
Influenza A/NWS virus, which is a mouse brain adapted type of human influenza A/NWS/33 virus was used. (A kind gift from Dr. K. Hayashi, Toyama University, Japan.)

Experimental animals
In total, 82 male BALB/c mice (5-week-old) were purchased from Japan Charles River Co. and given free access to food and water (Oriental Yeast, Co., Tokyo) and acclimatized for at least a week before the experiment.

 PFU/mouse). For negative control mice, the same amounts of 0.1 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) were intranasally inoculated. The mice were examined at 1, 3 and 6 days postinfection (p.i.).

Body weight
Body weight changes were monitored daily.

Euthanasia
All mice were decapitated whilst under ether inhalational anesthesia. Each brain was divided into eight regions (frontal cortex, occipital cortex, cerebellum, medullar oblongata, hippocampus, corpus striatum, thalamus/hypothalamus and olfactory bulb). Then each section was immediately frozen with liquid nitrogen.

 (Power Chrome, EICOM, Kyoto) by Griess reaction.

RNA extraction
RNA was extracted from each part of the brain by using a QIA amp RNA extraction kit (QIAGEN K.K., Tokyo), according to the protocol suggested by the manufacturer.

cDNA synthesis
cDNA was synthesized from purified RNA by using the Transcriptor First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Roche, Switzerland). Random hexamer primer was used and the protocol was as follows; after annealing for 10 min at 25°C, and incubating 30 min at 55°C, the reaction was heated to 85°C for 5 min and chilled on ice.

Real time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)
Messenger RNA levels of NOS-1, NOS-2 and NOS-3 were quantified by using a Light Cycler Fast Start DNA Master HybProbe (Roche). This was done according to the following protocol; Pre-incubation was 95°C for 30 s. This was followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 10 s, annealing at 62°C for 15 s, amplification at 72°C for 8 s for 45 cycles. Cycles were followed by 30 s 40°C cooling program. The primers and probes were designed by the Light Cycler primer and probe set (Roche Diagnostics Applied Science, Tokyo). NOS-2, NOS-3 and NOS-1 primer sequences were designed on GenBank database NM_0100927, NM_008713, and NM_008712 respectively. All data were normalized by dividing with the corresponding GAPDH mRNA from the same sample.

All sections were counterstained with Mayer’s hematoxylin (SIGMA, MI).

Statistical analysis
Fisher’s exact test was used when comparing body weights. All results obtained from the real time RT-PCR were subjected to one- or two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and differences among the means were analyzed by two-way ANOVA followed by a Newman–Keuls range test at the 0.05 significance level. Results are expressed as mean ± standard error.

]. Since bodyweight changes are an indicator of the overall condition of the mice, this bear out that the mice was infected to the virus. More over, we have checked that RT-PCR for A/NWS/33 virus were positive in all brain regions expect medullar oblongata on day 1 p.i. (data not shown).
The reason why we determined the amounts of influenza virus in this experiment is as followed. During the past experiment, we had experienced that the mice die within 3 days p.i. when inoculating any more than the virus we used this time and when we use fewer viruses, there were hardly any difference in the non-infected and infected behavioral change.

, our results show that astrocytes are activated in the infected mouse brain and especially in hippocampus. Interestingly, we noticed that both the increased NOS-2 and GFAP staining were mostly found around capillary blood vessels of the hippocampus starting at an early stage. Our results suggest that since NOS-2 and astrocytes became activated around capillary blood vessels after viral infection, this may lead to brain capillary blood vessels break down. However, we were unable to determine whether the NOS-2 measured is derived from vascular endothelial cells or macrophages which will be an issue for future experiments.

]. However, no standardized therapy for the treatment of IE has yet been defined. In this paper, we suggest that the influenza virus causes the activation of astrocytes and NOS-2 in the brain. Thus it is likely that our results will add supportive evidence for the development of a novel IE therapy.
