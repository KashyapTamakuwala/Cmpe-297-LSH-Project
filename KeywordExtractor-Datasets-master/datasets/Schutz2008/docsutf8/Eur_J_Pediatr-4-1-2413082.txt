A 15-year-old girl was admitted with chest pain, progressive shortness of breath, fever, nonproductive cough, decreased appetite, weight loss, and fatigue. The patient was born in Angola, but had lived in the Netherlands for 14 years. Seven months before admission she had traveled to the Democratic Republic of Congo in Western Africa.
Her temperature was 39.7°C, her pulse 90 beats/min, respiratory rate 28 breaths/min, and blood pressure 96/58 mmHg. No enlarged lymph nodes were found. Soft cardiac tones and a friction rub were noticed. The liver was enlarged.
Laboratory results showed normal white blood cells and platelets with a decreased hemoglobin (4.3 mmol/l). The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 60 mm/h.

M. tuberculosis
 DNA was positive on the pericardium, though not in the pericardial fluid. The patient was treated with four anti-tuberculous drugs (isoniazide, ethambutol, pyrazinamide, rifampicin) for 4 months and two anti-tuberculous drugs for an additional 4 months. Adjunctive treatment with predinisolone was tapered over a 12-week period. The patient completely recovered and did not develop any signs of constrictive pericarditis. She was followed up for more than 1 year and then discharged because of uneventful recovery.

]. Clinical manifestations of tuberculous pericarditis are nonspecific and cardiopulmonary complaints usually develop later. Accumulation of pericardial fluid may compromise venous return, leading to cardiac failure.

]. A positive tuberculin skin test may increase the suspicion of tuberculous pericarditis, but a negative skin test does not exclude the diagnosis. A tuberculin skin test was not performed in this case because the girl had been immunized with BCG. There was no history of any family members being diagnosed with TBC.
