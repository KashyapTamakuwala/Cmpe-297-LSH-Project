State quitlines provide an effective vehicle for telephone counseling and can be accessed by calling 1-800-QUIT NOW, a national portal number to refer tobacco users directly to their state quit line based on their area code. A small number of states also provide over-the-counter medications to eligible populations in conjunction with telephone counseling. Another group of states (e.g., Maine, Massachusetts, Oklahoma, Oregon, and Wisconsin) encourages providers to fax referrals (with patient consent) to the state quitline, which in turn proactively calls the smoker to begin counseling. Most quitlines send a “quit kit” to each caller.
