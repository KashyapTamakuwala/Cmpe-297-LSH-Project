A key difference of high temperature–short time thermal therapy protocols from the traditional hyperthermia protocols is the significant injury accumulation during the non-isothermal portion of the thermal history (heating up/cooling down period). Therefore, injury accumulation tends to be a complex function of hold time as well ramp up and cooling time. Hence, accurate prediction of the cell injury kinetics requires the knowledge of heating/cooling rates in addition to peak temperatures (PTs) and hold/total time. This model also better represents the thermo-clinical applications because the rate at which the PTs are achieved at different locations inside the tumor vary with the applicator location and plays a paramount role in determining the amount of injury accumulated. The knowledge of the injury accumulated in reaching a PT or the PT required to obtain a desired injury under different heating rates (HRs) are some of the very important parameters in designing better and optimal clinical protocols.

 T flasks. The cells were trypsinized with Trypsin-EDTA (ATCC, VA) for 5–10 min, centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 5 min and re-suspended in the media to an appropriate concentration. Suspended cell samples were prepared by placing 3 μl of cell suspension onto the center of the 12-mm diameter coverglass, covering it with another coverglass to prevent evaporation during heating. For attached cell studies, cell suspension was scattered over about 18–20, 12-mm cover glasses lying in a 110-mm diameter Petri dish. Overnight attachment of the cells on top of the coverglass was allowed in the incubator and then the cell sample was prepared in the same way as the suspended sample.

Heating Studies and Ethd-1 Dye Uptake Assay

.
Cellular injury post heating for isothermal and non-isothermal studies was quantified using Ethd-1 (Sigma-Aldrich, MO) vital dye assay by counting the number of cells stained with Ethd-1 dye (dead only) and the total number of the cells stained with Hoechst (Sigma-Aldrich). Thermally treated cell samples were placed in a 50 μl drop of 2.5 μM Ethd-1 and 10 μM Hoechst dye solution in a 35-mm Petri dish and incubated for 3 h. The incubation time of 3 h was based on the experiments conducted after 1, 2 and 3 h of incubation (data not included), which confirmed that membrane damage equilibrates within this period and a significant amount of media is pulled between the cover glasses to stain the cells. Control samples underwent the same procedure without heating. After 3 h, the dead and the total number of cells were counted with a fluorescent microscope (Nikon Eclipse TS 100, Tokyo) using a 20× objective. Multiple fields with at least 150–300 cells were counted for each run.

-test assuming unequal variance. Each data point is an average of three separate runs using two different cell samples for each run. The error bar in the figure represents the standard error of the mean. Data points marked with asterisks indicate the data points where viability of suspended and attached cells is significantly different.




The figures also show the effect of PTs on the slope of the survival curve. The drop in the survival with the increase in the hold time is slow at low PTs. The survival curve gets steeper as the PT increases. When heated at 50°C for up to 9 min, the cell survival is still higher than 0.43 for both suspended and attached cells. This trend changes for 55°C, where the cell survival drops to 0.03 after only 6 min of heating. This trend magnifies sharply as the PTs increases to 60, 65 and 70°C. For suspended cells, the survival at 60°C varies from 0.58 to almost zero survival as the hold time increases from 0.5 to 3 min. The survival dropped from 0.2 to 0.003 for an increase in the hold time from 15 s to a min at 70°C. The attached cells also showed a similar trend with slightly higher survival than the suspended cells for all the data points.

value of 0.088 for 60°C – 2 min data point suggests the difference in the cell viability is not significant, but is still different. As no significant difference between the survival of suspended and attached HepG2 cells was observed for most of the time–temperature histories and since attached cells better describe the arrangement of the cells in a tissue, only attached cells were used for further non-isothermal studies.

Injury Kinetics of Attached and Suspended Cells

 also obtained similar results for SN12 human renal cell carcinoma within the same temperature range, where the reason for this difference between suspended and attached cells was assumed to be the difference in their protein synthesis and gene expression. It may be assumed that some of the above differences also exist between attached and suspended HepG2 cells used in this study. The results shows a clear difference between the frequency factors for both the cell types, but the activation energies does not show much variation. But since the difference in the survival of suspended and attached cells is small either of the cell type can be used in studying the cell injury kinetics in HepG2 cells.

Comparison with Previous Hyperthermic Studies

 In this study, heating at 45°C for 15 min (data not included) and at 50°C for 9 min also shows a significantly higher (>42%) survival for attached and suspended HepG2 cells indicating the possibility of a shoulder region for these short time protocols. However, whether they biologically behave in a similar fashion to the hyperthermic shoulders by demonstrating thermotolerance has not been studied and further investigation is clearly warranted to verify these facts.

 Such break points have been observed at 43.5°C for human cell lines and 43°C for rodent cell lines. We have observed no significant break point for our studies between temperatures of 55–70°C. However, one interesting observation in our study was that heating at 60°C for 3 min for attached and suspended cells, shows a sudden change in the slope of the survival curve. The survival drops from ∼0.25 at 2 min to 0.003 after 3 min of heating, suggesting the possibility of a distinct change in the response to heating at 60°C for HepG2 cells.

, respectively. These values are higher than the ones obtained in this study which is not surprising since clonogenic assay yields higher activation energies than dye uptake assays. Since the activation energies obtained in this study are in the same range of the values obtained for other dye uptake assays, we suggest that the mechanism of thermal injury and its measurement is consistent with other studies.

 are representative of all the locations within the tumor for any selected energy source, while the temperatures between 85°C and 50°C are descriptive of the actual temperature distribution inside the tumor during the thermal application. Temperatures higher than 85°C might result in carbonization near the applicator as well as overheating of the healthy tissue beyond the edge of the tumor, while temperatures lower than 50°C may result in insufficient injury accumulation within the short treatment time. Therefore, design of clinical thermal therapy protocols requires knowledge of the survival patterns for different hold times and precise prediction of hold and total treatment times to obtain desired cellular injury within the above mentioned range of HRs and PTs.
