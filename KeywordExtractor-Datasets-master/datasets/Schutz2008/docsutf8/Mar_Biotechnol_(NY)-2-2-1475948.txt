 were identified, and their promoter activity was examined in transgenic zebrafish. The 5′ flanking regions of the Japanese flounder complement component C3, gelatinase B, keratin, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) genes were linked to green fluorescence protein (GFP) as a reporter gene. The promoter regulatory constructs were introduced into fertilized zebrafish eggs. As a result we obtained several stable transgenic zebrafish that displayed green fluorescence in different tissues. Complement component C3 promoter regulated GFP expression in liver, and gelatinase B promoter regulated it in the pectoral fin and gills. Keratin promoter regulated GFP expression in skin and liver. TNF gene promoter regulated GFP expression in the pharynx and heart. TNF promoter had lipoplysaccharide-inducible activity, such that when transgenic embryos were immersed lipopolysaccharide, GFP expression increased in the epithelial tissues. These 4 promoters regulated the expression of GFP in different patterns in transgenic zebrafish.

). This technique has provided a powerful tool for analyzing the regulation of gene expression in living fish. The pattern of expression of GFP in these transgenic zebrafish was the same as that of the gene from which the promoter was derived. However, promoters derived from most marine aquaculture species have not been described. To generate transgenic aquaculture fish, tissue-specific and stress-inducible promoters from these species need to be identified.

). In these reports we focused on cDNA clones that displayed tissue-specific expression or inducible expression, and 4 Japanese flounder genes were chosen for this study: complement component C3, gelatinase B, keratin, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) genes. These genes were chosen because they were revealed to be expressed in specific tissues of Japanese flounder by EST analysis. We assumed that the promoter region of these genes would show tissue-specific or inducible activities.
It is possible to generate an effective transgenic fish using tissue-specific or inducible promoters. Indeed, such promoters can regulate foreign gene expression faithfully. In contrast, use of a housekeeping gene promoter would result in nonspecific expression (i.e., overexpression) of foreign genes that may be harmful to the host fish. In this study we developed several Japanese flounder promoters that showed tissue-specific or inducible gene expression with the aim of using these in Japanese flounder. Although we have succeeded in introducing a foreign gene into Japanese flounder fertilized eggs and shown transient expression in Japanese flounder embryos, it has been difficult to conduct promoter assays in vivo because the technology has not been sufficiently developed to produce transgenic Japanese flounder with the necessary efficiency. However, the transgenic zebrafish model system has the advantages of shorter generation time, better optical transparency, and easier treatment schemes when compared with Japanese flounder. In this study, promoter regions of the complement component C3, gelatinase B, keratin and TNF genes were isolated and their promoter activities were characterized in transgenic zebrafish.

-3′. The PCR was performed with an initial denaturation step of 2 minutes at 95°C and then 20 cycles were run as follows: 30 seconds of denaturation at 95°C, 30 seconds of annealing at 55°C, and 1 minute of extension at 72°C. The reaction products were electrophoresed in a 2.0% agarose gel.

. A 20mer synthetic oligonucleotide corresponding to the complementary sequence of the first exon was labeled with fluorochrome. The fluorochrome-labeled primer was hybridized to 10 μg of kidney total RNA (extracted using Trizol, Invitrogen) and then extended using an AMV reverse transcriptase first-strand cDNA synthesis kit (Amersham Bioscience). Subcloned plasmid DNA, containing the first exon of each gene, was adopted as a template for the sequencing using the same fluorochrome-labeled primer. The sequence products were analyzed with primer-extended cDNA fragment by the cycle sequencing method.

Construction of Promoter-EGFP Plasmid
The reporter gene vector pEGFP-1 (Clontech) was used for the construct. Four different Japanese flounder promoters including 5′ untranslated region (UTR) were amplified by specific PCR primers and inserted into the multiple cloning site of pEGFP-1. GFP reporter gene was the endogenous initiation codon directly replaced with that of GFP. To confirm the sequence and direction of insert, the recombinant plasmid was sequenced using a Thermo Sequenase II kit and automated DNA sequencer 373A with a primer designed for pEGFP-1.

In this study we showed that heterologous promoters derived from Japanese flounder worked in transgenic zebrafish. However, the expression patterns different from endogenous Japanese flounder expression patterns. Notably, the keratin and TNF promoters seemed to work faithfully in zebrafish embryos, but the gelatinase B promoter result differed from the results predicted from Japanese flounder. This may have been due to the short 5′ flanking region used in this study. Furthermore, we only observed the GFP expression pattern in a single transgenic line. Whether this GFP expression pattern is representative of gelatinase B promoter activity needs to confirmed in future studies by establishing multiple transgenic lines. Similarly, the fate of these promoters in Japanese flounder needs to be determined by production of transgenic lines of Japanese flounder.
The Japanese flounder promoters developed in this study can be adapted for transgenic fish in a variety of situations. Keratin promoter induced expression in epithelial tissues, where it acts as a first line of defense against bacterial infection. It is possible to generate disease-resistant transgenic fish expressing an antibacterial or antiviral peptide only in epithelial tissues. Moreover, using the Japanese flounder TNF promoter, it is possible to generate transgenic fish expressing an antibacterial or antiviral peptide only in cases of infection with pathogens. Thus these promoters should be useful for production of disease-resistant transgenic fish. The overexpression of a foreign gene, especially the gene for an antimicrobial peptide, may suppress growth or maturity of the host fish. In addition, these transgenic fish are safe for human consumption, as the foreign gene is not expressed in the muscle. The Japanese flounder TNF gene promoter can also be used to monitor bacterial infection in live fish using GFP as an indicator. Furthermore, these transgenic zebrafish were suitable for developmental analysis of specific tissues or organs. It is possible to observe development of liver, gills, and skin in living embryos using GFP expression.

). The development of tissue-specific, inducible promoters in this study will support the establishment of transgenic technology for Japanese flounder and should contribute to a better understanding of the biology and culture of this fish species.
