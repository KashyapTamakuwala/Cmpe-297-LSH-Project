Arterial complications after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) are rare. We present a case report of a 44-year-old male patient with a subtotal occlusion of the popliteal artery, with sensory loss in the foot, 17 days after ACLR. Embolectomy and anticoagulant therapy led to full recovery of the peripheral arterial circulation. The sensory loss of the foot also fully recovered. To our knowledge, this is the first case report of an embolus of the popliteal artery after ACLR without relation to graft fixation. A literature review on vascular complications after ACLR is presented.

]. We present a case of arterial embolism of the popliteal artery after ACLR. A literature review on vascular complications after ACLR is presented.

Case report
A 44-year-old male has a previous medical history of open medial and lateral ligament repair of the right knee 15 years previously (motor accident). Functional instability of the right knee due to ACL deficiency was the reason for referral to our service. There were no signs of posterior nor posterolateral instability. An ACLR was performed with a quadruple hamstring graft. The graft was fixed with a Bone Mulch Screw on the femoral side and a WasherLoc device in the tibia (Arthrotek, Inc. Warsaw, USA). The latter is a spiked washer with bicortical screw fixation. Total tourniquet time was 90 min. No complications were noted during or after surgery. Thromboprophylaxis for deep venous thrombosis was given by means of Low Molecular Weight Heparin (2500 IE daily) during hospital stay. The hospital recovery was uneventful.

].

] described an occlusion of the proximal popliteal artery. A composite graft consisting of a polypropylene ligament augmentation and the middle third of the quadriceps-patellar tendon was fixed to the lateral femur with a staple. The artery was trapped between the graft and the femur. A saphenous bypass was performed 6 weeks post surgery.
9
] reported a case of unilateral claudication 8 years after ACL reconstruction with use of a Gore-Tex ligament. A cyst had formed around the femoral insertion of the ruptured synthetic ligament and was excised without vascular repair.
3
] reported a pseudoaneurysm of the medial inferior genicular artery following ACL reconstruction using a central third patellar tendon graft fixed with interference screws. At 5 weeks, ligation of the artery and removal of the thrombus led to full recovery. The cause of the lesion was elevation of the periosteum on the medial side of the tibia for tibial tunnel preparation.
1
] described an avulsion of the middle genicular artery after a bone-patellar tendon-bone autograft fixed with interference screws. Surgical exploration at 4 weeks revealed a tear in the popliteal artery. There was no rupture of the posterior capsule. Probable cause for the avulsion of the middle genicular artery was the debridement of the femoral ACL remnant tissue.

]. There was no apparent direct damage to the popliteal artery in the 44-year-old male patient presented in this case report. The popliteal artery occlusion was not in line with either the femoral nor tibial fixation device. Vascular analysis did not reveal any pre-existent vascular causes for arterial embolus formation proximal to the popliteal artery. Our hypothesis of the cause was the traumatic knee dislocation 15 years previously. Precursors could have been pre-existent intimal vascular damage or adhesions of the artery at the level of the superior genicular artery in combination with the use of the tourniquet and ACLR.
