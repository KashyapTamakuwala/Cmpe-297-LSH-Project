 where a is the smaller diameter and b is the larger diameter. After euthanizing the mice, mammary tumors were dissected and weighed and the total tumor burden calculated (tumor weight/body weight). All studies followed the NIH guidelines for the care and treatment of experimental laboratory rodents.

Mammary gland whole mounts
Pairs of inguinal mammary glands were fixed in formalin or Carnoy’s fixative, dehydrated through a graded series of ethanol solutions and defatted in xylene. Following rehydration, the mammary epithelium was stained with carmine stain (Sigma Chemical, St Louis, MO) for 30 min. After removing excess stain by washing in water, samples were dehydrated and stored in methyl salicylate (Sigma Chemical, St Louis, MO).

). The model is frequently crossed with gene-targeted strains that have been generated in the B6/129 mixed background or backcrossed onto the B6 background. We had highly variable results examining iNOS effects in a mixed B6/FVB PyMT background and sought to characterize the phenotype of this mutation in congenic FVB and B6 strains. Our study demonstrates that the genetic background of the PyMT model can affect the ability to discern differences in phenotype due to genetic alterations that require time to influence tumor progression. Differences observed in the B6 background were obscured in the FVB background due to the signficantly shorter tumor latency and more rapid tumor growth in this strain.

). The proximity of the #1 glands to the submandibular gland make EGF induced proliferation a plausible explanation, however further investigations will be required to determine whether the release of this growth factor primarily affects the #1 glands.

). To increase our understanding of the molecular pathways involved in these effects, it is essential to have animal models that recapitulate the clinical findings. We have shown that in the PyMT B6 background loss of iNOS, an important inflammatory mediator, results in increased tumor latency and decreased tumor metastasis that is not due simply to the difference in latency. This model will be useful in determining molecular pathways underlying the role of iNOS in breast cancer.
