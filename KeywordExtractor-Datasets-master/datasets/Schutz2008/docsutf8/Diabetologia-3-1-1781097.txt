Blood glucose determination
 For determination of blood glucose levels, glucose levels in blood samples taken from tail vein were determined using a One Touch Ultra blood glucose monitor (LifeScan Inc., Milpitas, CA, USA). For the glucose tolerance test, mice were fasted overnight (15 h) prior to i.p. injection of glucose (2 mg/g body weight). Blood glucose levels were then determined at the indicated time-points following glucose injection. For the insulin challenge test, mice were fasted for 15 h prior to i.p. injection of 0.6 mU insulin/g body weight. Blood glucose levels were then determined at the indicated time-points following insulin injection.
Determination of insulin in plasma
g
 in a table-top centrifuge, and insulin in the plasma fraction was determined using an insulin ELISA system (ALPCO Diagnostics, Salem, NH, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Isolation of pancreatic islets and glucose-stimulated insulin release
15
]. Pancreata from three mice were pooled. After 24 h in culture, islets were preincubated in Krebs–Ringer bicarbonate buffer plus 0.1% BSA (KRBB-BSA) and 1.67 mmol/l glucose. The islet cells were incubated for 1 h in 1 ml KRBB-BSA containing the desired concentration of glucose (1.67 or 16.7 mmol/l). The incubation medium was then collected, and centrifuged and the supernatant fractions were used for assay of insulin content by ELISA. Total extractable insulin in islets was determined by adding 0.5 ml lysis buffer (1 mol/l acetic acid with 0.1% BSA) to the islet pellet. Cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation, and the supernatant fraction was used for insulin assay.
Fluorescent immunohistochemistry of pancreatic islets
16
Pten
+/−
 mice were embedded in paraffin. Five-micron sections were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with guinea-pig anti-insulin antibody (1:100 dilution; Dako, Mississagua, ON, Canada) and rabbit anti-glucagon antibody (Dako; 1:75 dilution). Sections were visualised by incubation with Alexa–Fluor 488 goat anti-guinea-pig (Invitrogen, Molecular Probes, Burlington, ON, Canada; 1:100 dilution) and Texas Red donkey anti-rabbit antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA, USA; 1:100 dilution). Sections were examined by fluorescence microscopy.
Beta cell mass calculation
 Following insulin immunostaining, pancreatic sections were captured under an FITC filter using a Zeiss Axioplan 2 microscope equipped for epifluorescence and Pathvysion imaging software. The insulin immunopositive area (as a proportion of pancreatic area) was determined in at least six fields per section using Zeiss AxioVision software, performed on eight pancreatic sections per mouse. Beta cell mass was calculated as pancreatic mass times the percent beta cell area for each mouse.

Determination of cell-surface GLUT1 and GLUT4 levels
 Primary myocytes were grown in 10-cm culture dishes. The cells were rinsed with PBS, and incubated with 0.5 mg/ml sulpho-NHS-LC-biotin (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL, USA) in PBS for 20 min. Cells are impermeable to this reagent and it labels the amine groups of cell-surface proteins. Following the incubation, the cells were washed three times with PBS, then lysed with 0.5 ml lysis buffer (1% NP-40, 150 mmol/l NaCl, 50 mmol/l Tris pH 7.5, including protease and phosphatase inhibitors). Protein was quantified with a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Streptavidin-agarose beads (Pierce) were pre-blocked by incubation with 2% BSA in lysis buffer. Each sample (1.2 mg protein) was incubated with the streptavidin beads (100 μl, 50% bead slurry) for 1 h at room temperature. The beads were washed five times, for 30–60 min each wash, using lysis buffer containing 0.1% SDS. After the final wash, 50 μl SDS sample-loading buffer were added, and heated at 95°C for 10 min, then vortexed to elute the biotinylated proteins. The proteins in the supernatant fractions were analysed by SDS-PAGE, then transferred to nitrocellulose. Proteins were probed using polyclonal antibodies against GLUT1 and GLUT4 (also known as SCLA2A1 and SCLA2A4, respectively).
Western immunoblotting for PKB, phospho-PKB and phospho-glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3)-α/β
 Total protein extracts of primary myocytes were prepared by lysing cells in NP-40-based lysis buffer. Thirty to fifty micrograms of protein per sample were analysed by SDS-PAGE, then transferred to nitrocellulose. Rabbit polyclonal anti-PKB, anti-phospho-PKB (Ser473) and anti-phospho-GSK3-α/β (Ser21/9) antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA, USA). Mouse monoclonal anti-vinculin antibody was obtained from Sigma (St Louis, MO, USA). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were obtained from Dako. Protein bands were visualised using an enhanced chemiluminescence system and autoradiography by exposure to X-ray film.

Pten
 haploinsufficiency leads to insulin hypersensitivity in vivo, suggesting that even small changes in Pten levels or activity can lead to dramatic effects on insulin responses. Thus partial systemic inhibition of PTEN activity may represent a novel strategy to ameliorate the pathology of type 2 diabetes.

Pten
 haploinsufficiency results in insulin hypersensitivity, which underscores the importance of PTEN in attenuating insulin signals, and suggests that small-molecule drugs that antagonise PTEN activity may represent a novel class of insulin-sensitising agents and targeted delivery of these agents to muscle cells or adipocytes may have potential clinical utility in treating insulin resistance observed in type 2 diabetes.
