-arabinose, through nanopores of orthorhombic hen egg white lysozyme crystals. Cross-linked protein crystals (CLPC), as novel biological nanoporous media, consist of an extensive regular matrix of chiral solvent-filled nanopores via which ions and solutes, e.g. sugars and amino acids, travel in and out. We studied the diffusive motion of arabinose inside protein channels. The computed diffusion coefficients within the crystal were orders of magnitudes lower relative to the diffusion coefficient of the solute in water. This study is valuable for understanding the nature of solute–protein interactions and transport phenomena in CLPCs and provides an understanding of biocatalytic and bioseparation processes using CLPC.

-arabinose in orthorhombic hen egg white lysozyme crystals. Fundamental questions are; do solute molecules move by translation and/or rotation? How solute–protein interactions influence transport of a chiral solute through the protein crystal? What is the detailed nature of the diffusive motion of solute molecules in a lysozyme crystal and what are the length scales and the time scales (dynamics) of all those events.

). The deviation is most likely as a result of single-point interactions between solute and side chains of the XI, which are usually characterized by hydrogen bindings and dipole-dipole interactions. Our preliminary analysis based on hydrogen bonds, number of contacts and minimum distance between Ara molecules and residues on the pore wall showed that the solute molecules spend considerable time in the vicinity of active site residues Lys96, Lys97, Lys116, Arg14, Arg21, and Asp87. This indicates that the orientation and translational-rotational motion of Ara play an important role in its transport through channels in orthorhombic lysozyme crystals.

). In a manner similar to that proposed for free lysozyme, our simulation results can be validated based on finding the most favorable interaction of the substrate molecules in the mixture with the catalytic active centers of the enzyme molecules in lattice. Such qualitative agreement with experimental data corroborates predictive capabilities of our model. Moreover, our study highlights the importance of the protein–solute interactions on the transport in protein crystals.
Despite its simplicity and obvious limitations, this computational study provides insight into the main features of solute transport in protein crystals. Our study allows relating transport properties of the nanopores in protein crystals to solvent and ion motion as well as to protein fluctuations. Although our findings are in good qualitative and quantitative agreement with existing experimental data, more experimental studies are still needed by which we can compare our data directly. These results in combination with experimental information provide vital insights for understanding biocatalytic and chiral separation processes in CLPC.

Conclusion
l
-arabinose) in nanopores of a fully hydrated orthorhombic lysozyme crystal. The electrostatic and steric interaction inside the crystal channel significantly influences the diffusion of solute. No clear adsorption site in the crystal was detected in the simulation, most likely due to the low solute concentration. However, our analysis show that the solute molecules spend considerable time in the vicinity of active site residues Lys96, Lys97, Lys116, Arg14, Arg21, and Asp87. According to our results, the average mobility of solute molecules in lysozyme crystal channels is reduced orders of magnitude compared to that in free water. This is why crystalline proteins are easily accessible to solute molecules that are smaller than the necks of the crystal channels. The results are of practical interest to evaluate the time necessary to impregnate the crystals with ligands, water and solutes and provide valuable insights of solute–protein interactions during solute transport in nanopores of protein crystals.
