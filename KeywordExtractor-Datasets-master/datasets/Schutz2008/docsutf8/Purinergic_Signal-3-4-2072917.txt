In experiments using the ADP-ribosylating factor of the inhibitory guanosine nucleotide binding protein (Gi), pertussis toxin [PTX, 200 ng/ml; in 50% glycerol, 0.5 M NaCl, and 0.05 M Tris-glycine (pH 7.5); Sigma] was added overnight (16 h). LY294002 and PD98059 were dissolved in and added to the culture medium at a final concentration of 0.01% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).

. After 24, 48 or 72 h, cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and AO-EB solution (6 μM/ml) was added to the wells. Cells were examined using a fluorescence microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). The number of fragmented nuclei and/or condensed chromatin was determined by counting >200 cells. The percentage of apoptotic cells is defined as: (total number of cells with apoptotic nuclei/total number of cells) × 100.

The cytosolic fractions of cell lysates were transferred into streptavidin-coated microplate wells, and a mixture of biotin-linked anti-histone antibody and peroxidase-linked anti-DNA antibody was added and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. Plates were washed with incubation buffer to remove the unfixed anti-DNA antibody and the peroxidase activity was determined spectrophotometrically with 2,2′-azino-bis[3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid] (ABTS) as the substrate (absorbance of 405 nm). The amount of DNA fragmentation is expressed as a percentage of the positive control provided with the kit.

 for 10 min at 4°C). Aliquots of supernatants (25 μl) were removed for the determination of the total protein concentration using the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA). We measured α-synuclein protein concentration using an ELISA kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, cell lysates (diluted 1:10) were added to α-synuclein antibody-coated wells in duplicate, allowed to bind and then were treated with the anti-α-synuclein antibody. This was followed by the addition of an anti-rabbit IgG-horse radish peroxidase-linked antibody, and by the addition of a stabilized chromogen (tetramethylbenzidine). The reaction was terminated by adding 1 M HCl (stop solution) provided with the kit, and the absorbance of each well was read at 450 nm. Standard curves were prepared using purified recombinant α-synuclein protein (100 ng/ml) provided with the kit. The concentration of the α-synuclein protein in each sample was determined from a nonlinear regression, and it is expressed as a ratio of α-synuclein protein (in ng/ml) to total protein concentration (in ng/ml).

-induced cytotoxicity after the pro-apoptotic pathways have already been activated. Thus, these findings are novel and demonstrate for the first time that guanosine can in fact ‘rescue’ neuroblastoma cells from apoptosis when it is added to cells under experimental conditions that are ‘clinically relevant’ to the treatment of PD.
