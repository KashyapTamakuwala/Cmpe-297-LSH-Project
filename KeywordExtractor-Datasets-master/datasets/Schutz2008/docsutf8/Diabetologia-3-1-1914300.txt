Aims/hypothesis
Type 2 diabetes mellitus has been associated with brain atrophy and cognitive decline, but the association with ischaemic white matter lesions is unclear. Previous neuroimaging studies have mainly used semiquantitative rating scales to measure atrophy and white matter lesions (WMLs). In this study we used an automated segmentation technique to investigate the association of type 2 diabetes, several diabetes-related risk factors and cognition with cerebral tissue and WML volumes.

Subjects and methods
k
-nearest neighbour classifier trained on ten manually segmented data sets. White matter, grey matter, lateral ventricles, cerebrospinal fluid not including lateral ventricles, and WML volumes were assessed. Analyses were adjusted for age, sex, level of education and intracranial volume.

Results
Type 2 diabetes was associated with a smaller volume of grey matter (−21.8 ml; 95% CI −34.2, −9.4) and with larger lateral ventricle volume (7.1 ml; 95% CI 2.3, 12.0) and with larger white matter lesion volume (56.5%; 95% CI 4.0, 135.8), whereas white matter volume was not affected. In separate analyses for men and women, the effects of diabetes were only significant in women.

Conclusions/interpretation
The combination of atrophy with larger WML volume indicates that type 2 diabetes is associated with mixed pathology in the brain. The observed sex differences were unexpected and need to be addressed in further studies.

-score.Brain MR images were acquired as part of the study. In 23 participants with type 2 diabetes and 11 control participants no MR images were available for automated analysis: in 14 cases (five controls, nine diabetic patients) an MR image had not been performed because of MR contraindications and in 20 cases (six controls, 14 diabetic patients) the scan could not be analysed automatically because of technical problems, such as failure to retrieve the digital MR images or incompleteness of the series of images, or because image quality did not allow automated processing. Data for 99 patients with type 2 diabetes and 46 controls were analysed. Age, sex and duration of diabetes for the excluded subjects were similar to those for the included subjects (control subjects, average age 64.6 years, five men and six women; diabetic subjects, average age 66.5 years, 13 men, ten women, average diabetes duration 8.7 years).
MR imaging
 Brain MR images were acquired on a Philips Gyroscan ACS-NT 15 whole-body system operating at 1.5 T (Philips Medical Systems, Best, The Netherlands) with a standardised MR protocol (slice thickness 4 mm, 38 contiguous slices, 230 × 230 mm field of view, 256 × 256 scan matrix). Axial T1, inversion recovery (IR), T2, proton density (PD) and fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) scans were made: T1, 234/2 ms (repetition/echo time); IR, 2919/410/22 ms (repetition/inversion/echo time); T2, 2200/100 ms (repetition/echo time); PD, 2200/11 ms (repetition/echo time); FLAIR, 6000/2000/100 ms (repetition/inversion/echo time).

Discussion
Our MR image-based segmentation paradigm showed that type 2 diabetes was significantly associated with smaller grey matter volumes and larger lateral ventricle and WML volumes, whereas white matter volume was not affected. A smaller grey matter volume suggests cortical atrophy, whereas a larger lateral ventricle volume may indicate subcortical atrophy. Separate analysis for men and women showed significantly smaller grey matter and total brain volumes and significantly larger lateral ventricle, CSF and total CSF volumes in female but not in male diabetic patients.

]. Diabetic women had non-significantly smaller age-adjusted total intracranial volumes than control women. However, the expected effects of these intracranial volume differences on brain tissue volumes were smaller than the observed differences in effects on grey matter, CSF and lateral ventricle volumes. Age is a very important predictor of brain tissue and WML volumes and age effects may have confounded the effects of type 2 diabetes in men and women in this study. Hence, the implications of the effect of sex observed in the present study remain to be determined.

], but their exact contributions to abnormalities in cerebral function and structure in diabetes still need to be elucidated.
A limitation of our quantitative automated volumetric segmentation algorithm is slight overestimation of the CSF and slight underestimation of the lateral ventricle volume in subjects with markedly enlarged occipital horns. Some misclassification of interhemispheric CSF as lateral ventricle might also occur. However, the misclassified volumes are small compared with ventricle (about 2% and 6%) and CSF (about 0.3% and 0.4%) volumes and total CSF volumes are not affected. The artefacts were proportionally distributed across men and women and between type 2 diabetes patients and controls. Therefore, it is unlikely that these inaccuracies affected the analyses. Furthermore, all segmentations were inspected visually, so results will not have been affected by other segmentation errors.

]. Furthermore, the learning data were segmented manually on the basis of IR and FLAIR images with the T1, T2 and PD images available to the expert for reference. Thus, our KNN classifier retrieves its learning data from expert segmentations based on all available information and segments using the optimal image combination for tissue classification.
Our automated segmentation method offers major advantages over manual methods by enabling precise, objective and reproducible volumetric measurements of cerebral tissues in large numbers of patients. In future studies, this method might be used to quantify the progression of abnormalities on MR images in patients with type 2 diabetes, as well as in patients with other conditions. Such studies using quantitative MR data should focus not only on the differences between groups of patients and controls, but also on differences within a patient group to identify determinants of structural brain changes.
