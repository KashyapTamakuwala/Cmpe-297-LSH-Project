Purpose
The purpose of this study was to identify combinations of dose rate and exposure time that have the potential to provide curative treatment with targeted radionuclide therapy applying low dose rate beta irradiation.

Methods
5
 tumour cells in each sample was irradiated with low dose rate beta particles. The criterion for successful treatment was absence of recovery of cells during a follow-up period of 3 months. The initial dose rates were in the range 0.1–0.8 Gy/h, and the cells were continuously exposed for 1, 3 or 7 days. These combinations covered dose rates and doses achievable in targeted radionuclide therapy.

Results
Continuous irradiation with dose rates of 0.2–0.3 and 0.4–0.6 Gy/h for 7 and 3 days, respectively, could kill all cells in each tumour cell sample. These treatments gave total radiation doses of 30–40 Gy. However, when exposed for just 24 h with about 0.8 Gy/h, only the SKBR-3 cells were successfully treated; all the other cell types recovered. There were large cell type-dependent variations in the growth delay patterns for the cultures that recovered. The U-118MG cells were most resistant and the U-373MG and SKBR-3 cells most sensitive to the treatments. The HT-29 and A-431 cells were intermediate.

Conclusion
The results serve as a guideline for the combinations of dose rate and exposure time necessary to kill tumour cells when applying low dose rate beta irradiation. The shift from recovery to “cure” fell within a narrow range of dose rate and exposure time combinations.

]. Factors of importance are ongoing vascularisation processes, variations in vessel wall leakage and changes in blood flow. There are probably also various diffusion and convection conditions in different areas of tumours, resulting in variable penetration properties of the radiolabelled targeting agents. In addition, there might be variations in the expression of target structures on the tumour cells. All these time-dependent factors make it difficult to establish basic and reproducible dose rate–response relations in vivo.

The exposure times were selected to correspond to the effective half-lives of the radionuclides delivered by targeting agents of different types.

Four cell dishes were placed in each irradiation chamber when the dose rate was as expected and the cells were then kept there for 24, 72 or 168 h (1, 3 or 7 days). The radiation exposure time was chosen not to be longer than a week, since it is known from numerous articles in the field of radionuclide therapy that the tumour cell retention of radioactivity is generally in the range of some days up to about 1 week (in some cases it is only a few hours). Furthermore, it is well known that the biological half-life of tumour targeting agents (ligands, antibodies and antibody fragments) in the systemic circulation is often shorter than a week (in the case of small ligands, it is only a few hours). Thus, the longest exposure time considered to be realistic was 1 week.

b shows examples of growth curves for an initial dose rate of 0.806 Gy/h and an exposure time of 24 h. After 24 h the dose rate had decreased to 0.768 Gy/h and the exposure gave a total dose of about 18.9 Gy. The irradiated A431 cells continued to grow, but at a slower rate than the controls. The growth of irradiated U-118MG cells was arrested for up to about 40 days after the treatment. During those 40 days, resting cells were observed in the culture flasks, but there was no sign of growth. After 40 days a few mitotic cells were observed in the phase contrast microscope, and the number of cells was thereafter measured with the electronic cell counter. A clear regrowth was seen after 60 days. However, their growth rate was slower than that of the corresponding controls. The SKBR-3 cells looked severely damaged (fragmented, decreasing in number and forming giant cells) some days after the exposure and were too few to be counted with the electronic cell counter. Within 1 month, no surviving cells could be observed in the culture flasks. In this case, too, we continued to control the culture flasks for 3 months (with normal medium changes) and found that there were no remaining cells in these cultures. Thus, A-431 and U-118MG cells survived, while the SKBR-3 cells died.

Discussion
The obtained results can hopefully serve as a guideline for the combinations of dose rate and exposure time necessary to kill tumour cells when applying low dose rate beta irradiation. The shift from regrowth to “cure” (no surviving cells) fell, for each cell type, within a narrow range of combinations.
The U-118MG cells were more resistant to the treatments than the U-373MG and SKBR-3 cells. The A-431 and HT-29 cells showed intermediate resistance. However, the differences between the cell lines were not dramatic, and it can be generally stated that when applying 7 days of continuous irradiation, initial dose rates of about 0.2–0.3 Gy/h were enough to kill all cells in the cultures. When exposed for 3 days, an initial dose rate in the order of 0.4–0.6 Gy/h was needed. When the cells were exposed for only 24 h it was not possible to kill all the cells (with the exception of SKBR-3 cells), even if the initial dose rate was as high as about 0.8 Gy/h.

 tumour cells have to be killed by radiation, even if other tumour cells are killed by other means.
When considering radionuclide therapy it is, of course, also important to consider unwanted effects on normal tissues. The tolerance doses for most normal tissues are not known when exposure is to low dose rate irradiation. Targeted radionuclide therapy, using, for example, radiolabelled antibodies, fragments of antibodies or various receptor ligands, is expected to result in highly tumour-specific uptake of the therapeutic radionuclides. Thus, for a curative intent it is reasonable to establish the necessary tumour dose rates and exposure times. Another obvious question is which targeting agent should be tried for each type of tumour and, most importantly, whether the required conditions can be achieved without excessively severe side-effects on normal tissues. However, analyses of effects on normal tissues were beyond the scope of this study.

 block and some radiation-induced apoptosis, but the amount of apoptosis was smaller than for U-373MG cells. Thus, the results from that study indicated the U-373MG cells to be more sensitive than the other two cell lines owing to a higher degree of apoptosis. This is in agreement with the cell-killing results from the present study.

Thus, these cells can be considered typical for their tumour groups, at least regarding intrinsic radiosensitivity at high dose rate exposure. The HT-29 colorectal carcinoma is an exception, since it seems to be somewhat more radioresistant than most other colorectal carcinomas.
