Future application of adult stem cells in clinical therapies largely depends on the successful isolation of homogeneous stem cells with high plasticity. Multipotent adult progenitor cells (MAPCs) are thought to be a more primitive stem cell population capable of extensive in vitro proliferation with no senescence or loss of differentiation capability. The present study was aimed to find a less complicated and more economical protocol for obtaining single cell-derived MAPCs and understand the molecule mechanism of multi-lineage differentiation of MAPCs. We successfully obtained a comparatively homogeneous population of MAPCs and confirmed that single cell-derived MAPCs were able to transcribe Oct4 and genes of three germ layers simultaneously, and differentiate into multiple lineages. Our observations suggest that single cell-derived MAPCs under appropriate circumstances could maintain not only characteristics of stem cells but multi-lineage differentiation potential through quantitative modulation of corresponding regulating gene expression, rather than switching on expression of specific genes.

Immunocytofluorescence and fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis
Clonal cultured MAPCs were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 4 min at room temperature. After being blocked with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 2% BSA, cells were permeabilized with 0.1%Triton-X100 for 10 min. Slides were incubated sequentially overnight at 4°C with the following primary antibodies: CD71 (1:50, Santa Cruz, USA), Vimentin (1:200, DAKO, USA), α-SMA (1:200, Boster Biotechnology, China), and SSEA-1(1:50, Santa Cruz, USA); then cells were incubated for 40 min at room temperature with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) or Cy3-coupled IgG secondary antibody (1:500, Jackson), stained with DAPI (Sigma–Aldrich), and observed under a fluorescence microscope (BX41TB, Olympus, Japan).
For fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis, cells pelleted were incubated on ice for 30 min with FITC- or PE-conjugated monoclonal antibodies against CD34, CD44, CD45 (Becton–Dickinson, CA), and MHC-I (Abcam, UK). After two washes with cold PBS, the labeled cells were analyzed by a FACStar flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, CA, USA).

In vitro differentiation of MAPCs
To induce differentiation, clonal cultured MAPCs were cultured in the media containing no FCS, EGF, PDGF-BB, or LIF unless otherwise indicated. All the experiments were repeated at least three times.

 in six-well plates, allowed to grow confluence, and cultured for another 3 days. Subsequently, cells were allowed to differentiate for 14 days in the expansion medium of MAPCs containing 0.5 mM 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (Serva Electrophoresis, Germany), 100 nM Dex, 60 μM indomethacin, and 10 μg/ml insulin. At the end of the culture, cells were fixed with 10% formaldehyde (Shenggong, China) for 10 min and were stained with fresh Oil Red O (Sigma-Aldrich) for 2 h.

 for further passage, and finally screening for clone-like cells. We found that single cell-derived MAPCs did not express CD34, CD45, CD44, and MHC-I, which was consistent with the results of Verfaillie’s team, who found that MAPCs were able to reserve their pluripotency when plated at a low density, and unable to do so when plated at a much higher density. With pluripotency decreasing, CD44 and MHC I turned from negative to strongly positive in MAPCs, and therefore could serve as a marker for the loss of pluripotency. It should be notified that our protocol for MAPC isolation, which involved direct adherence, passage selection, single cell clonal culture and low density passage, is less complicated and more economical than that of Verfaillie’s team, who employed the technique of immunomagnetic microbeads. The reliability of our protocol is verified by its results. Single cell-derived MAPCs retained their multi-potential differentiation capability even after being passaged for 20 generations, and could not only give rise to adipocytes and osteoblasts (mesoderm) but to neurons, glia cells (ectoderm), and hepatocytes (endoderm).

]. MIAMI cells still expressed telomerase, Oct-4, and Rex-1 even after being expanded for more than 50 population doublings. In the present study, our medium contained a low level of serum, but was supplemented with growth factor and LIF, which promoted the proliferation of MAPCs to some extent and retained their dedifferentiated state. Single cell clonal culture and low density passage may help to isolate a more homogenous cell population with strong proliferation capability.

] demonstrated that MSCs expressed germline, ectodermal, endodermal, and mesodermal genes before neurogenesis. The present research extended their observations. Our observations confirm that single cell-derived MAPCs transcribe Oct4 and genes of the three germ layers simultaneously, and could differentiate into multiple lineages. It may be concluded that under appropriate circumstances, single cell-derived MAPCs can maintain not only characteristics of stem cells but multi-lineage differentiation potential which has expressed corresponding regulating genes, and single cell-derived MAPCs could differentiate into multiple lineages through quantitative modulation of regulating gene expression, rather than switching on expression of specific genes.
