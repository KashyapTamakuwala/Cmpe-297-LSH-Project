Normal bone mineral accrual requires adequate dietary intake of calcium, vitamin D and other nutrients; hepatic and renal activation of vitamin D; normal hormone levels (thyroid, parathyroid, reproductive and growth hormones); and neuromuscular functioning with sufficient stress upon the skeleton to induce bone deposition. The presence of genetic or acquired diseases and the therapies that are used to treat them can also impact bone health. Since the introduction of clinical DXA in pediatrics in the early 1990s, there has been considerable investigation into the causes of low bone mineral density (BMD) in children. Pediatricians have also become aware of the role adequate bone mass accrual in childhood has in preventing osteoporotic fractures in late adulthood. Additionally, the availability of medications to improve BMD has increased with the development of bisphosphonates. These factors have led to the increased utilization of DXA in pediatrics. This review summarizes much of the previous research regarding BMD in children and is meant to assist radiologists and clinicians with DXA utilization and interpretation.

Introduction
1
]. The clinical uses of DXA in pediatrics are exceedingly broad. This paper reviews the clinical data regarding pediatric DXA and can be used to assist radiologists and clinicians in DXA utilization and interpretation.

Gastrointestinal disorders
Gastrointestinal diseases may impact bone health in several ways. Poor calcium intake, as in patients with a milk allergy, and reduced calcium absorption, as in patients with untreated celiac disease, result in low BMD. Early correction of the underlying deficiency allows normal bone mineralization to occur. In addition to poor calcium absorption, inflammatory bowel disease likely impacts bone health through other factors including chronic diarrhea, decreased lean tissue mass, reduced physical activity, increased inflammatory cytokines, and CS therapy. As in all chronic conditions, correction of short stature and delayed maturation will allow better identification of those patients with abnormal DXA findings who will have significant bone mineral deficits.
Milk allergy

]. There was a positive correlation between BMD and calcium intake with normal values in the subgroup with normal dietary calcium intake and decreasing BMD as the daily intake of calcium decreased. LS BMD was maintained, even with severe dairy restrictions when calcium intake was maintained through diet or supplementation.

Inflammatory bowel disease
5

]. Thus, in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, the apparent low LS BMD and TBBMC is largely a result of short stature, delayed maturation and decreased lean tissue mass.

Celiac disease

] found an increase in height, weight, BMC and BMD after 1.5 years of a gluten-free diet when compared to baseline measurements. These reports indicate that in patients with celiac disease, normalization of DXA findings can be expected with early diagnosis and treatment.


Liver disease

15
] found normal LS BMC and BMD in patients with childhood liver failure who were at least 1 year out from orthotopic liver transplantation. Return to normal values appeared to be unaffected by the severity of bone disease or cholestasis prior to transplantation. Thus, liver dysfunction with disordered vitamin D metabolism results in early decreased bone mineral accrual. With successful liver transplantation, normalization of DXA findings can be expected.

Renal diseases
Chronic kidney disease results in abnormal bone metabolism via disturbances in calcium and phosphate handling, altered vitamin D and parathyroid hormone levels and function, and altered renal clearance of other metabolites. Additional factors that affect the BMD in these patients include malnutrition, metabolic acidosis, anemia and growth hormone abnormalities resulting in growth retardation. As with many chronic medical conditions, short stature will greatly affect BMD and needs to be accounted for in DXA interpretation.

In summary, the various metabolic disturbances resulting from altered renal physiology may compromise normal bone mineralization and remodeling, but children with chronic kidney disease often maintain normal BMD if calcium and vitamin D metabolism are normal. CS treatment, either before transplantation or when used to suppress transplant rejection, appears to contribute to low BMD but short-term follow-up indicates eventual normalization of LS BMD. Regardless of the nature of renal disease, correcting for height is essential for accurate interpretation of DXA results in these patients.

In summary, hormonal imbalances from any of a large number of endocrine disorders are associated with abnormal DXA findings and reduced BMD. With hormone replacement therapy, improved bone mineral accrual is to be expected in most of the endocrine deficiencies. However, with anorexia nervosa, especially with onset in adolescence, there appears to be a sustained reduction in BMD even after resumption of normal caloric intake and menses.

] examined bone turnover and growth hormone status with respect to physical activity levels and BMD in adult survivors of childhood ALL. The patients were all prepubertal at the end of treatment and had been treated with high doses of CS and methotrexate. No patient had evidence for gonadal or endocrine dysfunction. The BMD values were normal for the group. Only the level of physical fitness at follow-up correlated positively with BMD. The authors stressed the importance of physical activity in restoring and maintaining normal BMD in survivors of childhood ALL.
In summary, children with ALL will have reduced BMD during treatment and shortly thereafter. The recuperative capacity in young children is high and normal BMD should be expected even after high-dose methotrexate and CS therapy. The role of adequate physical activity is being increasingly stressed as an important factor in normal BMD recovery. Children who have survived ALL may be at risk of persistently low BMD in adulthood if they have confounding factors such as gonadal dysfunction or if the course of their disease coincided with the period of expected rapid accrual of bone mineral that normally occurs during puberty.

Other malignancies

] found that patients with childhood brain tumors treated with cranial irradiation had reduced LS and TBBMD and these were correlated with reduced physical activity and poorer quality of life. The authors postulated that the higher cranial radiation doses used for the treatment of brain tumors had a profound effect on long-term BMD compared to the relatively lower doses used in the treatment of ALL.
In summary, there are multiple factors that affect short- and long-term BMD in these patients/survivors. These include pubertal status at diagnosis, type of malignancy, local (sarcomas, central nervous system tumors) versus systemic (leukemia) disease, initial (malnutrition, immobilization) versus prolonged (amputation) disease-related disability, types of chemotherapy, and radiation ports and dosages that may cause gonadal or growth hormonal dysfunction.

In summary, children with CP show decreased bone mineral status that reflects the duration and severity of their disease. Distal femoral measurements better reflect the bone status at the sites more at risk of fracture. Bisphosphonate therapy increases BMD during treatment and it appears to have sustained benefits with reduced fracture rates even after treatment is terminated.

Meningomyelocele
108
109
110
] found normal forearm and LS BMD in adult patients with meningomyelocele, but reduced hip BMD in one-third of the patients. There was a trend for low hip BMD in the nonambulatory compared to ambulatory patients but not for the LS. This dissociation of LS and hip BMD values was thought to be due to relatively preserved axial loading on the LS in upright patients with meningomyelocele. The normalization of forearm BMD in these adult patients was attributed to increased upper extremity muscular stress with the use of crutches and manual wheelchairs.

] found that long-term methotrexate for JRA did not result in reduced LS or TBBMD.
In summary, prepubertal children with JRA of mild or moderate severity without a history of CS treatment will have TBBMD similar to healthy children. With increasing disease severity and duration, especially through puberty, TBBMC will decrease when compared to normal children.
118
119
]. Unlike patients with JRA, these patients typically do not have bone and joint involvement and thus are more likely to have preserved BMD. However, factors that may negatively impact bone health in these patients include immobility, limited exposure to sunlight, and CS therapy.


Musculoskeletal diseases
For normal mineralization to occur, adequate muscle-induced mechanical stresses are required to induce bony remodeling. Insufficient muscle mass and activity result in poor bone accrual and low BMD. Additionally, therapy of primary muscle disorders with CS also inhibits normal bone mineralization.
Duchenne muscular dystrophy and dermatomyositis
120

122
] found an increase in LS and TBBMD after 2 years of bisphosphonate treatment, supplemental calcium, and vitamin D. Improvement in TBBMD was inversely related to age at baseline.
In summary, patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy have reduced LS BMD, especially in the setting of CS treatment. The low LS and hip BMD worsen with loss of ambulatory status and are frequently associated with fractures of the lower extremities.
