Objective
This study investigated the efficacy, safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of a novel cholesterol absorption inhibitor, FM-VP4, comprising disodium ascorbyl sitostanol phosphate (DASP) and disodium ascorbyl campestanol phosphate (DACP).

Methods
In phase 1, 30 men received a single dose of 100, 200, 400, 800, 1,600, or 2,000 mg FM-VP4 or placebo. In phase 2, 100 men were treated with 100, 200, 400, or 800 mg/day of FM-VP4 or placebo for 4 weeks.

Conclusion
This study demonstrated that up to 800 mg/day of FM-VP4 is safe and well tolerated for at least 4 weeks. Furthermore, the higher doses significantly reduced LDL-C by 7% compared with baseline or by 10% compared with placebo, with the maximum effect reached at 400 mg/day.

Preclinical data suggested that FM-VP4 is a potent cholesterol-lowering agent with no significant toxic effects. Here, we report the first human study designed to assess the efficacy, safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of single and multiple doses of this water-soluble plant stanol analogue.

Subjects and methods

, and did not use any steroids, β-blockers, corticosteroids, thiazide diuretics, or antiepileptics. Subjects with a history of hypertension, arterial diseases, diabetes mellitus type I or II, hypothyroidism, obstructive biliary disorders, pancreatitis, collagen disorders, or autoimmune disease were excluded, as were subjects with history of malignancy during the previous 3 years, significant hepatic, renal, cardiac, or cerebral disease, or plasma levels of hepatic transaminases higher than two times the upper limit of normal (ULN). Subjects of phase 1 were not allowed to use any lipid-lowering drugs at inclusion, and the use of plant sterol- or stanol-containing products had to be discontinued at the inclusion visit. Subjects of phase 2 had to discontinue the use of plant sterol or stanol products or fish oils at the inclusion visit and statin treatment 6 weeks (40 days) before the start of study treatment. Thirty men participated in the phase 1 trial and 100 men in phase 2.

Design
This single-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation trial comprised two parts: In phase 1, 30 men received a single dose of FM-VP4. Five subjects were assigned to each dose group (100, 200, 400, 800, 1,600, or 2,000 mg), and within each group, one subject was randomly assigned to placebo. Once a complete cohort of five subjects was treated and the safety parameters had been reviewed, the following dose was initiated. In the subsequent phase 2 trial, 100 men were treated for 28 days (4 weeks). Twenty-five subjects were assigned to each dose group (100, 200, 400, or 800 mg/day), and within each group, five subjects were randomly assigned to placebo. The first five subjects in each cohort were hospitalized for 5 days. Escalation to the next dosing level was only allowed once these five subjects completed treatment and all results and safety data were evaluated.
Phase 1
 A week before treatment, subjects visited the hospital for screening. Informed consent was obtained, and subjects underwent a physical examination. A fasting blood sample was taken to measure lipids, biochemistry, and hematology. Within 3 days before treatment, subjects visited the hospital for another blood sample, and urinalysis and electrocardiogram (EKG) were performed. If subjects met all inclusion criteria, they were hospitalized for 24 h on the day of treatment. In the morning, subjects’ weight, supine blood pressure (BP), and heart rate were measured, and a predose fasting blood sample was taken for baseline safety parameters and pharmacokinetics. Subsequently, subjects were administered one to 20 tablets containing 100 mg FM-VP4 each or placebo. Tablets were swallowed with 250 mL of water. Breakfast followed 30 min later. Weight, supine BP, and heart rate were recorded at 3, 6, 9, and 12 h after dosing. A blood sample for pharmacokinetics was taken 6 and 12 h after dosing. Any spontaneous complaints were recorded as adverse events and closely monitored. Subjects were detained overnight under observation, and 24 h after dosing, another blood sample was taken for safety parameters and pharmacokinetics. Subjects’ weight, supine BP, and heart rate were measured, and urinalysis and an EKG were performed. Once the EKG, biochemistry, and hematology of the 24-h postdosing sample had been reviewed, subjects were discharged from the hospital. They returned to hospital 48, 96, and 144 or 168 h (6 or 7 days) after treatment for weight, supine BP, and heart rate measurements and for a blood sample to measure safety parameters and pharmacokinetics. At the last visit, a final physical examination was performed.
Phase 2
 Four to 8 weeks before treatment, subjects visited the hospital for screening. Informed consent was obtained, and subjects underwent a physical examination. A fasting blood sample was taken to measure lipids, biochemistry, and hematology. Subjects were instructed to follow a diet adapted from the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Step 1 diet during the entire study, including the 4- to 8-week run-in period. Consumption of plant sterol- or stanol-containing products and the use of fish oils had to be discontinued at the screening visit, and statin treatment had to be discontinued 6 weeks before treatment with FM-VP4. If they met all inclusion criteria, subjects visited the hospital halfway through the run-in period and within 3 days before study treatment for baseline blood lipids, biochemistry, and hematology measurements. At the latter visit, urinalysis was performed and an EKG recorded.The first five subjects per dose cohort, of which four were on active treatment and one on placebo, were hospitalized for 5 days. Each morning, subjects’ weight, supine BP, and heart rate were measured, and a predose fasting blood sample was taken for safety parameters and pharmacokinetics. Subsequently, subjects were administered one to four tablets containing 100 mg FM-VP4 each, depending on the dose cohort, or placebo. Tablets were swallowed entirely with up to 100 mL of water. Breakfast followed 30 min later. All doses were divided and given twice per day; another one to four tablets were administered 30 min before dinner. The morning and evening doses were packaged in separate bottles. Subjects in the 100-mg group received one FM-VP4 tablet and one placebo tablet. Supine BP and heart rate were also recorded daily after lunch and dinner. Any spontaneous complaints were recorded as adverse events and closely monitored. Subjects were observed overnight and discharged 5 days after the first dosing. All subjects visited the hospital for efficacy and safety measurements once per week during and 14 days after treatment. At the last visit, a final physical examination and an EKG were performed. Compliance was calculated based on the number of tablets supplied to the patient minus the number returned.

Results
In phase 1, 30 male volunteers completed the study in accordance with the protocol. There were no withdrawals. The majority of subjects (93%) were of Caucasian descent. Mean subject age was 50.4 (range 24–63) years. In phase 2, 101 male subjects were enrolled, but one subject withdrew consent prior to receiving study medication due to personal reasons and therefore contributed no safety or efficacy data. The remaining 100 subjects completed the study. The majority of subjects (89%) were Caucasian, with the remaining being Asian or another race. Mean subject age was 53.7 (range 23–75) years. As calculated from returned tablets, the mean percentage of received tablets was 97%. One subject in the 800-mg group had a compliance <80%. All other patients received >80% of the planned number of tablets during the treatment period. Five subjects received statin treatment within 40 days before the first dose of study treatment (29–35 days). Mean weight ranged between 83.9 ± 13.1 and 84.6 ± 13.0 kg during the entire study.
Adverse events
In phase 1, 23 treatment-emergent adverse events were reported by 16 subjects. Of these events, five (21.7%) occurred in the 100-mg group, three (13.0%) in both the 200- and 400-mg groups, four (17.4%) in the 800-mg group, two (8.7%) in the 1,600-mg group, and three (13.0%) in both the 2,000 mg and placebo groups. All reported events were mild. The most common events were dizziness, headache, and fatigue. Other adverse events were loose stools, vasovagal attack, influenza, upper respiratory tract infection, elevated bilirubin, elevated BP, arthralgia, difficult micturition, polyuria, and pharyngolaryngeal pain. Three events were considered to be possibly related to the study drug. One was reported by a subject receiving the placebo treatment, whose bilirubin concentration increased from 12 μmol/L on the morning of treatment (baseline) to 25 μmol/L 24 h after treatment but decreased to normal 7 days after treatment. The other two possibly related events were reported in the 800- and 1,600-mg groups, and both consisted of one episode of loose stools on the day of treatment.
In phase 2, 67 subjects reported one or more treatment-emergent adverse events: 12 in the 100-mg group, 14 in the 200-mg group, 11 in the 400-mg group, 15 in the 800-mg group, and 15 in the placebo group. Most events were mild, and four subjects reported a moderate event. The most frequent event was headache, which was reported by a total of 19 subjects and by two (400-mg group) to five subjects (100-mg and 200-mg groups) in each of the five groups. The four adverse events that were moderate included two subjects with headache in the 800-mg group, one subject with an elevated CK level in the 400-mg group, and one subject with epilepsy in the placebo group. No subjects discontinued study treatment due to a treatment-emergent adverse event. One subject in the 800-mg group did not take the study medication for 3.5 days due to nausea and diarrhea, which was not considered to have been related to the study drug. Once the subject recommenced treatment, no further treatment-emergent adverse events were reported.
A total of 24 subjects reported events that were considered to be drug-related: eight in the 100-mg group, one in the 200-mg group, two in the 400-mg group, six in the 800-mg group, and seven in the placebo group. The most commonly reported event was flatulence, which was reported by three subjects in the 100-mg groups, one in the 400-mg group, two in the 800-mg group and one in the placebo group. There were no differences in the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events between active and placebo groups.

Blood pressure, heart rate, and EKG analysis
There was no effect of FM-VP4 on BP or heart rate during phase 1. In phase 2, the mean systolic BP was slightly decreased after 4 weeks of treatment (a maximum average of 4% in the 100-mg group; data not shown), but there was no relationship between this decrease and the dose of FM-VP4. Diastolic BP did not change. All pre- and postdose EKGs were normal in both phases of the trial.

/L during the study. Two subjects showed an increase in CK levels that was greater than five times the ULN. In one of these patients, who was in the 400-mg group, the event was recorded as an adverse event of moderate severity. In the other subject, who was in the placebo group, the event was not recorded as an adverse event, as the patient had performed vigorous exercise the previous day. Both subjects continued with medication, and both had CK levels within normal limits at subsequent measurements. Five subjects showed a decrease in hemoglobin of a least 1.5 g/d (0.93 mmol/L): one each in the 100-mg, 200-mg, and 400-mg groups, and two in the placebo group. However, those decreases occurred only once, and levels were restored to normal at the subsequent visit. Therefore, those changes were not considered clinically significant.

Overall, there were few abnormal laboratory values, and no trends were observed over time. There appeared to be no relationship between laboratory parameters and the dose of FM-VP4 administered.

Efficacy
In phase 1, changes in lipids and lipoproteins were not statistically compared between the seven treatment groups, as only one dose of FM-VP4 was administered.

 of days 8, 28, and 42 represent all 80 subjects on FM-VP4. DASP and DACP were not present in plasma at day 1 (baseline), and DACP concentrations were mostly below detection limit during the first 5 days of intake in the 100-mg group. The mean levels of DASP in the 100-mg group and DACP in the 200-mg group were below the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) because some of the subjects had levels below the LLOQ, which were regarded as 0 ng/ml




DASP and DACP concentrations increased in a less than dose-proportional manner compared with baseline on days 8 and 28, as well as on day 42, 14 days after treatment.

Plant sterol and stanol concentrations
In phase 1, concentrations of campestanol and sitostanol did not change within 24 h and 7 days after a single dose of FM-VP4. Also, concentrations of campesterol and β-sitosterol were not affected after a single dose of FM-VP4 (data not shown).

Discussion
In this study, we showed that a single dose of 100–2,000 mg as well as 4-week treatment in doses of 100–800 mg of FM-VP4 administered to moderate dyslipidemic men was well tolerated and safe. Furthermore, 4-week treatment of FM-VP4 reduced LDL-C levels by 6–7% compared with baseline or by 9–11% compared with placebo.
The main treatment—emergent adverse events were dizziness, headache, and fatigue after a single administration and headache after multiple-dose administration of the drug. All symptoms resolved spontaneously, and subjects receiving placebo also reported these symptoms. As there was no difference in the incidence between active and placebo groups, it is unlikely that the treatment-emergent adverse events were due to FM-VP4.

], we think this single CK increase was likely to be a chance finding. In addition, five subjects from various dose groups showed a hemoglobin decrease at one of the visits. These decreases were nonpersistent, and levels had returned to normal by subsequent visits. No EKG or hemodynamic abnormalities were detected after administration of FM-VP4. Also, no liver or kidney abnormalities were identified. Thus, in terms of safety tests, there was no evidence that treatment with FM-VP4 caused any acute or delayed toxicity.

As we have not administered labeled FM-VP4 intravenously, we were not able to estimate the bioavailability of FM-VP4 in humans and to investigate whether the esterified ascorbate group affects its absorption. Future studies with FM-VP4 are needed to assess the bioavailability of FM-VP4 in humans.

]. It is unknown whether DACP and DASP activate such genes within the enterocyte or whether there may be systemic effects or additional mechanisms to decrease cholesterol absorption. Further research is needed to elucidate the mechanism by which several types of plant sterol and stanol esters lower LDL-C levels.
In conclusion, this study demonstrated that single and multiple doses of FM-VP4 for 4 weeks are safe and well tolerated by moderately hypercholesterolemic subjects. Furthermore, the higher doses of FM-VP4 significantly reduce LDL-C levels by 6–7% compared with baseline or by 9–11% when compared with placebo. The pharmacokinetics showed that DACP and DASP are absorbed and cleared slowly but that the absolute quantity of drug absorbed is low, as suggested by the low plasma concentrations of DACP and DASP. This study suggests that FM-VP4 merits further investigation as an alternative for treating hyperlipidemia.
