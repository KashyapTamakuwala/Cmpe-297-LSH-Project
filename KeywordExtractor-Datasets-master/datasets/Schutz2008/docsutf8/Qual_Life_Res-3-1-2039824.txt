Background
The purpose of this study was to describe the health status and work limitations in injured workers with musculoskeletal disorders at 1 month post-injury, stratified by return-to-work status, and to document their return-to-work trajectories 6 months post-injury.

Methods
A sample of 632 workers with a back or upper extremity musculoskeletal disorder, who filed a Workplace Safety and Insurance Board lost-time claim injury, participated in this prospective study. Participants were assessed at baseline (1 month post-injury) and at 6 months follow-up.

Results
One month post-injury, poor physical health, high levels of depressive symptoms and high work limitations are prevalent in workers, including in those with a sustained first return to work. Workers with a sustained first return to work report a better health status and fewer work limitations than those who experienced a recurrence of work absence or who never returned to work. Six months post-injury, the rate of recurrence of work absence in the trajectories of injured workers who have made at least one return to work attempt is high (38%), including the rate for workers with an initial sustained first return to work (27%).

Conclusions
There are return-to-work status specific health outcomes in injured workers. A sustained first return to work is not equivalent to a complete recovery from musculoskeletal disorders.

The purpose of this study was to describe the health status, assessed by multiple outcome measures, and work limitations, in injured workers with MSK disorders 1 month post-injury stratified by RTW status, and to document their RTW trajectories over a period of 6 months post-injury.

Materials and methods
Study design
The present study was conducted within the sampling frame of a prospective study of Ontario workers with a back or upper extremity (UE) MSK disorder, who filed a Workplace Safety and Insurance Board (WSIB) lost-time injury claim. Data was collected from two sources: self-reports of participants and WSIB administrative data. The participants were interviewed by phone at baseline (1 month post-injury), and 6 months post-injury. Participants provided information on their RTW experience, workplace, healthcare provider, insurer, and physical and mental health. From the WSIB, administrative information on sociodemographics, workplaces, and claims (e.g., site of injury, claim status, time receiving wage replacement benefits) was obtained. This information was linked to the interview data, when the participants provided written consent for linkage. Ethical approval for the study was granted by the University of Toronto’s Ethics Review Board. Participants were given the option to withdraw from the study at any point and to decline data linkage of their questionnaire responses with their WSIB data. It was made explicit to the respondents that study participation would in no way affect their claim with the insurer.

However, consenters were more likely to have a higher level of education, and male consenters were more likely to be older than male non-consenters (Franche et al., submitted).

]. The WLQ-16 covers four domains: output demands (4 items), mental demands (6 items), physical demands (4 items), and time management demands (2 items). Items are scored on a 5-point scale, ranging from “none of the time” to “all of the time.” The scores on the individual items are summed, averaged, and transformed to a standardized score of 0–100, with a higher score indicative of more limitations. The internal consistency Cronbachs α’s were 0.82 (output demands), 0.86 (mental demands), 0.78 (physical demands), and 0.76 (time management demands) at baseline.

Sociodemographics, days off work, and comorbidity
Participants provided information on age, gender, education, living status, number of children under the age of 18, and personal income. Information on occupational status was obtained from the WSIB database. One self-reported question assessed how many full days of work a participant had missed due to the injury. In addition, data on time receiving wage replacement benefits was obtained from the WSIB database. The Saskatchewan Comorbidity Scale was used to measure comorbidity (Jaroszynski et al., unpublished work). The 16/14-item (women/men) self-report scale assesses the presence and severity of health problems. Participants are instructed to indicate whether they currently have a particular health problem/disease and, if so how much it has affected their health in the last 6 months. The response options range from 1 = “not at all” to 4 = “severe.” In the present study, two additional items pertaining to gynecological problems and pregnancy status were added for women. Responses were combined and categorized as: no comorbidity, comorbidity with no/mild effect on health, and comorbidity with moderate/severe effect on health.

Group differences in baseline characteristics
A total of 625 participants were categorized into one of the four RTW status groups. The remaining seven participants were working when interviewed at baseline, but not asked about recurrence(s) due to an error in a skip pattern of the questionnaire, which was subsequently corrected. At baseline (approximately 1 month post-injury), 47% of the participants reported a sustained first return to work, 5% a return to work with recurrence(s) of work absence and working at time of interview, almost 9% a return to work with recurrence(s) of work absence and not working at time of interview, and 39% no return to work.

Moreover, male non-respondents tended to be younger than male respondents, whereas in females differences in age were not statistically significant. Otherwise, non-respondents did not differ significantly with respect to other sociodemographic, workplace, health status, and work absence variables tested, including time receiving wage replacement benefits, re-instatement of wage replacement benefits 6 month post-injury, self-reported work absence duration 1 month post-injury, and claim status. Full details of the attrition bias analysis have been reported elsewhere (Franche et al., submitted).

Discussion
The findings of this cohort study suggest the presence of a pattern in baseline health states and work limitations specific to RTW status, 1 month post-injury. Workers with a sustained first return to work reported less pain, less functional disability, better physical and mental health, fewer depressive symptoms, and fewer work limitations compared to those who experienced a recurrence of work absence or who never returned to work. The study adds to the literature by demonstrating that depressive symptoms and limitations at work are prevalent in workers 1 month post-injury, including in those with a sustained first return to work. A substantial rate of recurrences of work absence over 6 months was found (38%), even in workers who had initially made a sustained first return to work at baseline (27%). Moreover, of those workers who did not return to work at baseline, 17% attempted to return and experienced a recurrence within 6 months of the injury, and 24% were still off work at 6 months post-injury.

] and highlights the need to address and examine the mental health of workers suffering a workplace injury. Moreover, 6 months post-injury we found a high rate of recurrences of work absence (38%) in workers who had made at least one RTW attempt, which is consistent with studies suggesting that there is considerable movement in and out of work after the first return to work [15 Côté et al., submitted]. In a study among 1,321 US workers who filed a workers compensation claim for back pain, Côté et al. (submitted) observed that 23% and 30% of the workers, 6 and 12 months post-onset of back pain, respectively, experienced multiple work absences.
When interpreting the results, the following methodological issues must be considered. Though reasonable for a study among claimants, the overall participation rate of 61% raises the question of selective participation, which may have biased the results. However, the cohort was shown to be representative of the most comparable claimant group with regards to basic demographic and workplace variables, but not with regards to duration of time receiving wage replacement benefits and rates of wage replacement re-instatement, suggesting the presence of more severe disability in the cohort. Hence, the generalizability of the results remains limited with respect to workers with less severe work disability. More importantly, the rates of self-reported recurrence of work absence may be inflated in our cohort.
A related issue concerns the loss-to-follow-up of 29%. The attrition analysis demonstrated that non-respondents and respondents were similar with regards to time receiving wage replacement benefits, the occurrence of re-instatement of wage replacement benefits, and self-reported work absence duration. Non-respondents were younger males, worked longer hours, and were more likely to specify “back” as their primary pain site compared to respondents.

], and also study them in relation to a broad range of factors (e.g., RTW interventions, disability management strategies) that might have influenced the RTW process and the outcomes considered. Finally, future research should identify early prognostic factors of the trajectories, particularly focusing on the “problematic” trajectories (recurrences and persistent work absence), so that guidance for an optimal reintegration or for recurrence prevention can be provided.
To conclude, the results of this prospective study suggest that workers who had a sustained first return to work report a better health status and fewer work limitations than those who experienced a recurrence after a first return to work or who did not return to work. However, it is also demonstrated that a return to work is not equivalent to a complete recovery from MSK disorders. Workers who had a sustained first return to work still reported meaningful health limitations, as compared to the general population and significant work limitations. Given the considerable impact of disability on worker health and costs for the workers, employers, and society, the findings highlight the importance of considering multiple health outcomes, including depressive symptoms and work limitations, when studying the complex process of return to work and when developing RTW interventions and disability management strategies.
