The aim of the investigation was to detect neuropsychological markers, such as sustained and selective attention and executive functions, which contribute to the vulnerability to schizophrenia especially in young persons. Performance was assessed in 32 siblings and children of schizophrenic patients and 32 matched controls using Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, Colour-Word-Interference-Test, Trail Making Test, and d2-Concentration-Test. The first-degree relatives showed certain impairments on all four tests, in particular, slower times on all time-limited tests. These results suggest the need for more time when completing neuropsychological tasks involving selected and focused attention, as well as cognitive flexibility, as a possible indicator of genetic vulnerability to schizophrenia.

]. In research the Stroop Test (FWIT), the Trail Making Test (TMT), and the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), have been used especially to assess executive or higher-order functions such as working memory, cognitive adjustment and maintenance of set. However, only few studies have applied the d2-Concentration-Test (d2) or the above-mentioned tests to a young population with a genetic risk.

] refer to these test when assessing cognitive functioning and neuropsychological risk indicators in schizophrenic patients and persons at high risk, because these tests make demands on cognitive processes based in the frontal lobes, a brain area vulnerable to potential antecendents of schizophrenic disorder. All of these tests are supposed to have high effect sizes for test variation with a medium level of difficulty. Additionally, we used the d2-Test because it, in particular, makes demands on concentration and discrimination between similar stimuli under high time pressure in routine tasks.

]) in order to examine the probands’ executive functions such as working memory and maintenance of set as well as cognitive flexibility. The probands were asked to successively place 128 response cards, showing symbols drawn in different combinations of color, form, and number, under one of four stimulus cards. After ten consecutive correct trials, the criteria according to which the response cards were selected changed. The examiner provided information only on correct or incorrect choices and the probands had to find out by themselves according to what criteria the response cards were to be placed. We evaluated the percentage of correct trials (WCST/PCT), the percentage of perseverative errors (WCST/PPE), and the number of completed categories (WCST/NC).

] as a version of the Stroop-Test was used to determine general alertness, naming skills and selectivity. At first the probands were asked to read aloud a list of color names printed in black, second to name the color of strokes, and third to name the color of different colored words. This run was repeated two times and the time required for reading was assessed. Finally, we calculated time needed (FWIT/A), naming skills (FWIT/N), selectivity of relevant information (FWIT/S), and number of errors on the interference task (FWIT/E).

]) provides information about psychomotoric speed, cognitive flexibility and working memory. Part A of the TMT requires the subjects to connect numbers in rising sequence. For Part B of the TMT, a line is drawn to connect alternating numbers and letters, starting with the number one, and then to the letter A, also in rising sequence. We determined time required for TMT/A and TMT/B as an indicator for working speed as well as cognitive flexibility using a ratio of TMT/A and TMT/B.

]) provides information about the ability to discriminate between similar stimuli, measured by speed and accuracy of performance. The probands have to mark all “d”s that have two strokes within an array of 14 lines, with 20 s allowed per line. The probands must also discriminate between similar stimuli, because there are “d”s with one or more than two strokes, and “p”s with strokes. We counted the number of all scanned characters measuring the working speed (d2/GZ as the German expression for number of scanned characters). Furthermore, the ratio of incorrectly marked characters (d2/F as the German expression for error rate) to all scanned characters (d2/GZ) as an indicator of accuracy was assessed.


Results 
The primary aim of the data analysis was to evaluate group differences for the parameters described above and to examine connections between the variables. Therefore, we tested our hypothesis that the genetic risk group of unaffected children and siblings of schizophrenics would perform more poorly on the tests than would healthy controls. Furthermore, we assumed that relatives of schizophrenics would show a wider pattern of impairments than would healthy controls. All statistical analysis were done using SPSS software (version 10.1).

Group differences
Compared to the controls, first-degree relatives of schizophrenic patients were significantly impaired in their performance on certain parts of all tests. For the WCST variables “percentage of correct trials” (PCT), “percentage of perseverative errors” (PPE), and “number of complete categories” (NCC), the analysis showed significantly worse results in the index group. The second finding of the three tests with time-limited demands, the FWIT, TMT, and d2-test, was that subjects with a genetic risk for schizophrenia worked at a significant slower rate as compared to the controls. Even though the variance of the significant results is greater in the high-risk group, these differences are not caused by extreme values. Statistical differences between the groups could not be detected for error rate on the TMT or on the d2, for cognitive control and flexibility or for naming skills on the FWIT (FWIT/N). However, first-degree relatives of schizophrenic patients produced significantly more mistakes on the interference task of the FWIT as compared to their controls.

]) for all probands, females showed a significantly higher cognitive flexibility on the TMT/B. Among all probands and within the risk group, males achieved significantly higher accuracy when demands were placed on cognitive adjustment during the interference task of the FWIT. They scored significantly lower on naming skills than did the females. No gender effects were found in the control group.

Relationships between variables 
The correlation between working speed and all time-limited tests (FWIT, TMT, d2) was highly significant, as was the correlation between speed and the PCT during the WCST. There is a positive connection between the accuracy of the d2 and the TMT. However, only the accuracy of the interference task on the FWIT correlated to parts of the WCST scores and the working speeds on the FWIT, TMT, and d2. While speed on the TMT is lower in the index group, there was no difference between the two groups regarding the ratio of the times required to complete the TMT/A and the TMT/B. Variable naming correlated only with general alertness on the FWIT. And selectivity on the FWIT did not correlate with any other performance variable.
Additionally, we did some factor analyses to see if different cognitive test variables could reflect the same cognitive function or a general vulnerability for schizophrenia. Surprisingly, after orthogonal rotation we found three factors explaining almost 60% of variance. But the other 4 of 7 components had “Eigenwerte” between 0.55 and 0.97, so that we found almost as many factors as variables. After graphic representation, we are very cautious with an interpretation of the results of this factor analyses.


Discussion
This study examined the hypothesis that children and siblings of patients with schizophrenia, without a schizophrenic-spectrum disorder, show a pattern of decreased attentional and cognitive performance when compared to controls. Several findings of this study can be emphasized.
First, subjects at risk for schizophrenia were slower on all three time-limited tests; the FWIT, TMT, and d2. These results suggest that young persons with a genetic risk need much more time to achieve the same accuracy as the controls during routine work on the d2 and the TMT/A. The correlations among working speeds for all time-limited tests indicate that these tests assess the same components of an attentional process and that this may reflect a general vulnerability. On the other hand, on tasks with no time structure or constraints high risks showed a lower ability to establish, maintain or adjust a required conceptual level during the WCST. This finding suggests impaired executive functions, working memory, vigilance and cognitive flexibility, which cannot be compensated by using more time, as compared to the controls. Furthermore, it is fair to assume that parameters of the prolonged and more complex tasks of the WCST measure different cognitive processes than do those of the time-limited tests. Nevertheless, there are correlations between WCST-scores and other scores, especially regarding working speed.

].
Third, our findings regarding cognitive flexibility and naming skills on the FWIT are not reflected in the working speed for all time-limited tasks or in the intelligence of the probands. There is no correlation between these variables. However, there are significant correlations between the accuracy of the interference task on the FWIT with both the working speed for all time-limited tasks, as well as with WCST performance. Thus, both groups needed the same time to perform the interference task on the FWIT, but the high-risk probands made more mistakes. This is an indicator of impaired selectivity in distinguishing relevant from irrelevant stimuli. The results of the TMT test can be attributed to an impaired action speed but not to a lower ability of cognitive adjustment. Thus, the results do not allow a clear comparison of selectivity and naming performance in both groups. Probably the FWIT subtests, with their demands on naming and cognitive adjustment, reflect other aspects of the attentional process as compared to other parts of the tests used.

]. In contrast, we found lower working speeds on the TMT/A in the risk group, but not decreased selectivity on the ratios of the TMT subtests. However, we were able to confirm lower scores on the WCST among the risks without these special symptoms.

]. The design of the present study did not allow the analysis of such a complex issue. Effects are currently being evaluated in order to determine patterns of cognitive vulnerability of risk subgroups. However, the results from our ongoing project did confirm a link to genetic influences, because both groups were matched for age, gender and intelligence. So the differences between probands and healthy controls are due to their relationship with schizophrenic patients, respectively to the genetic vulnerability of first-degree relatives. Our results demonstrate that attentional impairments as shown by the data of the FWIT, TMT, and d2 may be a trait indicator of the disease and so, too, may deficits of cognitive adjustment and executive functions as determined by the WCST. We were able to show that starting at a young age persons at risk work more slowly in general and not only on specific interference tasks. This suggests a more easily distracted working memory even among these young subjects. Therefore, our findings support the need for future studies based on the same and similar multiple tasks in order to gather more evidence in the search to identify subgroups of vulnerable subjects.
