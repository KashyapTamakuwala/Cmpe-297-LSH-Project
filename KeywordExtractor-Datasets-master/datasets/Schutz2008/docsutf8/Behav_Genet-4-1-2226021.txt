Aggressive behavior displays a high heritability in our study group of Golden Retriever dogs. Alterations in brain serotonin metabolism have been described in aggressive dogs before. Here, we evaluate whether four genes of the canine serotonergic system, coding for the serotonin receptors 1A, 1B, and 2A, and the serotonin transporter, could play a major role in aggression in Golden Retrievers. We performed mutation screens, linkage analysis, an association study, and a quantitative genetic analysis. There was no systematic difference between the coding DNA sequence of the candidate genes in aggressive and non-aggressive Golden Retrievers. An affecteds-only parametric linkage analysis revealed no strong major locus effect on human-directed aggression related to the candidate genes. An analysis of 41 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the 1 Mb regions flanking the genes in 49 unrelated human-directed aggressive and 49 unrelated non-aggressive dogs did not show association of SNP alleles, genotypes, or haplotypes with aggression at the candidate loci. We completed our analyses with a study of the effect of variation in the candidate genes on a collection of aggression-related phenotypic measures. The effects of the candidate gene haplotypes were estimated using the Restricted Maximum Likelihood method, with the haplotypes included as fixed effects in a linear animal model. We observed no effect of the candidate gene haplotypes on a range of aggression-related phenotypes, thus extending our conclusions to several types of aggressive behavior. We conclude that it is unlikely that these genes play a major role in the variation in aggression in the Golden Retrievers that we studied. Smaller phenotypic effects of these loci could not be ruled out with our sample size.

In order to estimate the power of the pedigrees, we calculated the maximum obtainable LOD scores. Affected individuals were assigned haplotypes 2/2 in these calculations; unaffected parents were assigned haplotypes 1/2; and other unaffected individuals were assigned haplotypes 1/1. We assigned haplotypes 0/0 (unknown) to dogs from which we did not have a DNA sample. We assumed that there were four alleles of the hypothetical marker with equal allele frequencies.

Association study
To test for a more complex genetic effect of variants of the candidate genes, we performed an association study. Fifty aggressive Golden Retrievers were selected from our database. The main selection criteria were high estimated breeding values for human-directed aggression and as little interrelationship among the cases as possible. Non-aggressive dogs were selected for low estimated breeding values for both human- and dog-directed aggression. We avoided an excess of relationship within either the case or the control group. The non-aggressive group was completed with 25 dogs from the random group. A more detailed description of cases and controls is provided in Supplementary Information I.

The mean pairwise D′ between the SNPs flanking a candidate gene was used as an estimate of the local D′ in these estimations. Calculations were performed for two different genotype relative risks: 2 (genotype relative risk Aa = 2; genotype relative risk AA = 4) and 5 (genotype relative risk Aa = 5; genotype relative risk AA = 10).

We also analyzed the association of haplotypes with the phenotype. No significant associations were found (data not shown). In conclusion, there seemed to be no association between alleles, genotypes or haplotypes of SNPs that flank the candidate genes and human-directed aggression in the Golden Retrievers.

Discussion
We collected behavioral information and DNA samples of 281 dogs over a period of 10 years. Dogs were selected from this collection to evaluate four genes involved in serotonin metabolism by four methods: DNA sequence analysis of the coding region of the genes, genetic linkage analysis, genetic association analysis, and quantitative genetic analysis. The results indicate that it is unlikely that there is a major locus effect of one of the genes on aggression in the Golden Retrievers that we studied.

 contain SNPs close to splice sites (at position IVS2-10 and IVS9-12, respectively) that could theoretically affect splicing. However, the polymorphisms did not have a large effect on splice site prediction by three software programs. We performed mutation screening in a limited number of dogs and it is possible that we have missed rare alterations in the genes. Apart from this limitation, we conclude that there is no common variant acting on protein structure that contributes to the variation in aggression in our Golden Retriever sample.

 have a strong effect on aggression in the Golden Retriever families.
Our linkage analysis does not account for genetic heterogeneity or phenocopies. We have thus only tested for a very strong major locus effect. In reality, the aggressiveness in the Golden Retrievers may be more complex. We therefore used a third study design to investigate the candidate genes: association analysis. For this analysis, we used data from a large-scale genotyping project in 100 Golden Retrievers. Our power calculations demonstrate that this sample size is expected to be sufficient to detect variants that confer a high relative risk for a range of marker allele frequencies. From the total set of 60,073 SNP genotypes, we selected 41 SNPs that flank the candidate genes. We found no association between alleles, genotypes or haplotypes of these SNPs flanking the candidate genes and human-directed aggression of the Golden Retrievers.

). This suggests that molecular genetic studies of aggressive behavior should focus on specific classes of aggression. However, reduced aggressiveness towards man in the rats and foxes was accompanied by reduced fear of novelties and irritable aggression, indicating that there is overlap between classes. As long as the genetic roots of aggressive behavior are poorly understood, it will remain impossible to design a classification that reflects the genetic basis.

). This opens the opportunity for finding genes that have not been associated with aggression up to date. Such studies are in progress.
