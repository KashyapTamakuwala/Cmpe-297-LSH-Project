 = 0.247. The ferroxidase center of the aerobically crystallized ferritin contains one iron at site A and shows sites B and C only upon iron or zinc soaking. Electron paramagnetic resonance studies suggest this iron depletion of the native ferroxidase center to be a result of a complexation of iron by the crystallization salt. The extreme thermostability of PfFtn is compared with that of eight structurally similar ferritins and is proposed to originate mostly from the observed high number of intrasubunit hydrogen bonds. A preservation of the monomer fold, rather than the 24-mer assembly, appears to be the most important factor that protects the ferritin from inactivation by heat.

O. Ferric ions from the core can be reduced and released from the ferritin molecule when needed by a cell. Nevertheless, the chemical nature of the physiological reductants for iron release and in the case of anaerobes that of the physiological oxidants for iron uptake have not yet been established.

Herein we present the 3D structure of PfFtn, refined at 2.75-Å resolution. In contrast to the previously reported first structure of an archaeal AfFtn, the functional PfFtn 24-mer has the typical 432 point-group symmetry observed in other ferritins and BFRs. There are no four large pores such as were found in AfFtn. Instead, the characteristic threefold and fourfold channels are present in PfFtn.
P. furiosus
Thermotoga maritima
 (TmFtn), which has an optimal growth temperature of 80 °C, may be even more thermostable than PfFtn. The hyperthermal stability of PfFtn and other ferritins appears to result mainly from the preservation of the monomer fold rather than the 24-mer assembly, owing to a high number of intramolecular hydrogen bonds between main-chain atoms, and between main-chain and side-chain atoms.
The FC stability was analyzed by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). Without further experiments, the lack of FC iron sites B and C in nonsoaked PfFtn crystals obtained does not allow any conclusions supporting or contradicting the FC as a stable catalytic cofactor.

Cryoprotecting conditions consisted of briefly dipping the crystals into a modified crystallization solution containing 20% glycerol in the case of the as-crystallized and Fe-loaded crystals, and 25% glycerol in the case of the Fe-soaked and Zn-soaked crystals, prior to flash-freezing at −173 °C in a nitrogen-gas stream, using an Oxford Cryosystems low-temperature device.

] and the homologous TmFtn (PDB entry 1vlg) as the search model. The sequence of this 165 amino acid ferritin shares a 51% amino acid sequence identity (88 amino acid residues) with that of PfFtn (174 amino acids), and the only insertions or deletions occur at the termini of the subunit chains. However, despite the success of the MR calculations we believed that, because of the low resolution of the diffraction data, relatively low amino acid sequence identity with the search model, as well as the complexity of the structure, experimental phase information would be needed in order to obtain the best possible structural model from the data. To that end, the first BM-14 dataset was collected at a long wavelength (7.0000 keV, 1.7712 Å) from a crystal of as-isolated PfFtn with the intention of using S-SAD in phasing, whereas a second dataset was collected just above the Fe K-absorption edge (7.1500 keV, 1.7340 Å) from an Fe-loaded PfFtn crystal, with the aim of using Fe-SAD in phasing and also for better location of the incorporated Fe atoms. However, neither dataset could provide the desired independent phase information, owing to complications that arose from radiation damage, which prevented us from collecting the highly redundant dataset required for application of the S-SAD method to the first dataset, as well as the lack of a sufficiently high ordered Fe content, which limited the usefulness of the anomalous dispersion data obtained from the second dataset.

The coordinates for each of the remaining 35 monomers were obtained from those of the first by applying the appropriate NCS transformations, followed by model correction with TURBO using the electron-density maps obtained from both the DM and the Arp/wArp calculations. In these maps, peaks corresponding to Fe occupation of the A sites only in the FC were observed, and therefore only 36 iron sites (one per monomer), were included in the model.

], which exhibited 23 point-group symmetry, normally an attribute of the dodecameric DPS proteins. Even though PfFtn and AfFtn are highly similar archaeal ferritins (50 and 70% amino acid sequence identity and similarity, respectively), the PfFtn 24-mer has the canonical 432 point-group symmetry instead of the 23 point-group symmetry found in the AfFtn 24-mer. Although there may be other archaeal tetraeicosameric ferritins with 23 point-group symmetry like AfFtn, our structure clearly suggests that it is not a feature of all archaeal ferritins.

Nevertheless, the mutations of His118 and Cys130 also influenced the iron-binding capacity of HuHF and inhibited the binding of different metals by the channel to different extents. The different amino acid arrangements in the threefold channel of the various ferritins suggests the possibility of different iron incorporation mechanisms.

In the current experiment, the decrease in the amplitude of the FC EPR signal in the sample incubated in air for 2 months appears to be too small to be caused by iron translocation into the protein cavity. Instead, as shown by the sample incubated for 2 months in ammonium sulfate, the most likely cause for the lack of the B iron site in the as-crystallized PfFtn is iron complexation and removal by the crystallization agent.

] using default parameters, and were divided into three classes: between main-chain atoms only (MM); between main-chain and side-chain atoms (MS); and between side-chain atoms only (SS). The salt bridges were determined as a subset of SS hydrogen bonds, considering interactions between side chains of negatively charged Asp/Glu residues with side chains of positively charged Arg/His/Lys residues. Furthermore, a distinction between intramolecular (within the same monomer) and intermolecular (between neighboring monomers) hydrogen bonds was made. The MM bonds are mostly intramolecular and are responsible for the stability of the secondary structure elements (α-helices). The intramolecular MS and SS hydrogen bonds contribute to stabilize the 3D fold of the monomeric subunits. The intermolecular MS and SS hydrogen bonds are those that contribute most to the stability of the 24-mer.

 is the marked increase in intramolecular salt bridges between the ferritins of mesophilic (EcFtnA and CjFtn) and hyperthermophilic (AfFtn, TmFtn and PfFtn) organisms. Indeed, a similar but less clear trend is observed for the SS hydrogen bonds overall. These structural features could explain the higher resistance to thermal inactivation in the latter. However, this trend by itself does not validate our initial assumption that PfFtn is the most thermostable ferritin in the group. A secondary trend can be perceived for the main-chain intramolecular hydrogen bonds in the hyperthermophilic organisms (AfFtn, TmFtn and PfFtn), which is greatest in PfFtn, and may offset the effect of a lower number of intramolecular salt bridges in comparison with TmFtn. Therefore, the most important factor that protects PfFtn and other ferritins from thermal denaturation appears to be the preservation of the monomer fold, rather than the 24-mer assembly.


Conclusions
In this study, we reported the crystal structure of PfFtn. High sequence similarity between PfFtn, TmFtn and AfFtn suggests a separate group of thermostable ferritins. PfFtn is the second archaeal ferritin structure to be reported, following that of AfFtn. In spite of the high sequence identity (50%) between these two proteins, their quaternary structures are significantly different. PfFtn exhibited the 432 symmetry commonly found in other known ferritins, whereas AfFtn showed the 23 symmetry similar to dodecameric DPS proteins. The 23 symmetry of the AfFtn 24-mer resulted in four triangular pores with an approximate size of 45 Å, making large openings in the AfFtn shell. Therefore, the 23 symmetry of the AfFtn 24-mer remains an exception among ferritins, and further research is required to explain such an unusual conformation.
Three iron sites were observed in the FC of PfFtn monomer. Site A was present in the as-crystallized protein and sites B and C were observed only upon crystal soaking with either Fe or Zn ions. Combining these results with our measurements of the FC EPR signal prior to crystallization, where samples were incubated in air for 1 day and 2 months, and for 2 months in 2 M ammonium sulfate (the crystallization solution), we conclude that the lack of iron atoms at the B site is very likely due to their complexation by ammonium sulfate, and that the absence of these sites in the as-crystallized protein cannot be taken per se as evidence of a transient nature of the FC, in PfFtn and other ferritins.
The possible iron entry and exit routes of PfFtn, the threefold and fourfold channels, are similar to those from bacterial ferritins in the sense that the threefold channel is less hydrophilic and the fourfold channel is more polar than the channels of mammalian H and L chain ferritins.
T. maritima
, a bacterium which grows optimally at 80 °C, is probably more thermostable than PfFtn. Owing to a high number of intramolecular hydrogen bonds between main-chain atoms, and between main-chain and side-chain atoms, the main factor contributing to the high thermostability of PfFtn as well as the other structurally similar ferritins from hyperthermophilic microorganisms appears to be the preservation of the monomer fold rather than the 24-mer structure.
