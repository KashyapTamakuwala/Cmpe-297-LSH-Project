]. Here we present a patient who was referred to the surgeon for treatment of hemorrhoids but was diagnosed with anal melanoma.

Case report
A 62-year-old black man with a history of prostatism was referred to our hospital by his general practitioner with the diagnosis of bleeding hemorrhoids. For a 10-week period he noticed a swelling protruding from the anus with daily bleeding from the anus. Defecation was problematical because of pain, but the stool had a normal aspect. Inspection of the anus showed a painful swelling with a diameter of 1.5 cm with a dark necrotic aspect surrounding the anus below the dentate line. Rectal palpation was impossible because of pain. At the outpatient department the swelling was excised under local anesthesia of the entire anus (anal block). Because of the atypical aspect of the swelling, the material was submitted for pathologic examination, which revealed a melanoma of the anus. Further staging of the tumor was not possible based on this material because of fragmentation of the tissue.

]. Wide local excision was performed in 129 patients, and 172 patients underwent APR. Local recurrence developed in 47% of patients after WLE and in 23% of patients after APR. Although these data suggest a trend towards better locoregional control after APR, the difference was not statistically significant. In addition, there was no difference in overall survival between WLE and APR (median survival 21 months for WLE and 17 months for APR).

]. In patients with a tumor thickness below 1 mm, a local sphincter-saving excision with 1 cm safety margin would be appropriate; and in cases of a tumor between 1 and 4 mm, a wide local excision with a margin of 2 cm seems to be adequate. Patients with a tumor thickness above 4 mm or invasion of the internal sphincter muscle should be treated with APR. In the case report mentioned in this article, the tumor depth was 3.5 mm and excision margins were free of tumor, thus no additional APR was performed.

]. This patient showed a remarkable response to chemotherapy, with minimal residual disease and excellent quality of life at 12 months after the start of treatment. However, this therapy still has to be further evaluated and currently no standard systemic therapeutic regimen exists for metastatic anorectal melanoma.
In conclusion, anorectal melanoma represents both a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge to physicians given its non-specific presentation and rarity. It is associated with poor prognosis, regardless of the type of intervention used. Therefore, the overall treatment goal should be to optimize the quality of life. Since wide local excision is a more limited intervention associated with at least comparable survival compared to APR and no need for permanent colostomy, wide local excision is recommended as primary therapy if negative surgical margins can be achieved. APR should be reserved for patients in whom the tumor is thicker than 4 mm and/or involves the anal sphincter.
