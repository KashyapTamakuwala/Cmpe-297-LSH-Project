Objective
The causative micro-organism in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is often difficult to predict. Different studies have examined chronic morbidity and clinical symptoms as predictors for microbial aetiology of pneumonia. The aim of our study was to assess whether prior outpatient antimicrobial treatment is predictive for determining the microbial aetiology of CAP.

Methods
This was a hospital-based prospective observational study including all patients admitted with CAP between 1 October 2004 and 1 August 2006. Microbial investigations included sputum, blood culture, sputum PCR, antigen testing and serology. Exposure to antimicrobial drugs prior to hospital admission was ascertained through community pharmacy dispensing records. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to assess whether prior outpatient antimicrobial treatment is a predictor of microbial aetiology. Patient demographics, co-morbidities and pneumonia severity were considered to be other potential predictors.

Results
Streptococcus pneumoniae

 and Influenza virus A+B. Forty-seven of the patients (23%) had received initial antimicrobial treatment as outpatients. Multivariate analyses revealed that initial outpatient beta-lactam treatment was associated with a threefold increased chance of finding atypical pathogens and a threefold decreased probability of pneumococcal infection; the corresponding odds ratios were 3.51 (95% CI 1.25–9.99) and 0.30 (95% CI 0.10–0.90), respectively. Patients who received macrolides prior to hospitalisation had an increased probability of viral pneumonia.

Conclusion
Prior outpatient antimicrobial therapy has a predictive value in the diagnostic workup aimed at identifying the causative pathogen and planning corresponding antimicrobial treatment in patients hospitalised for pneumonia.

], although nonresponsiveness to prior outpatient antimicrobial treatment has also been suggested as a predictor of the aetiology of pneumonia. However, to date, this latter parameter has not been comprehensively quantified and documented. The aim of the study reported here was to assess whether prior outpatient antimicrobial treatment is a predictor of microbial aetiology in patients admitted to hospital for CAP.

Methods
The study was conducted in the St. Antonius Hospital, a 600-bed teaching hospital in Nieuwegein, The Netherlands.
Patient population
This was a prospective observational study of patients with confirmed pneumonia admitted between October 1, 2004 and August 1, 2006. Pneumonia was defined as a new or progressive infiltrate on a chest X-ray plus at least two of the following criteria: cough, sputum production, temperature >38°C or <35°C, ausculatory findings consistent with pneumonia, leucocytosis or leucopenia (>10 g/l, <4 g/l or >10% rods in leucocyte differentiation), C-reactive protein >3 times the upper reference value for normal. Patients who were immune compromised (systemic steroid use at admission (prednisone equivalent >20 mg/daily for more than 3 days), haematological malignancies and other immunosuppressive therapy) were excluded. The study was approved by the local Medical Ethics Committee, and informed consent was obtained from each patient.

 as causative pathogens (OR 1.87, 95% CI 1.00–3.47; OR 3.72, 95% CI 1.20–11.57, respectively). Patients who received macrolides prior to hospitalisation had an increased probability of viral pneumonia (two of five cases, 40%) (crude OR 8.67, 95% CI 1.34–56.23).

Discussion
S. pneumoniae
 infection and a threefold increased probability of having pneumonia of atypical aetiology were associated with the patient having received an initial beta-lactam treatment as an outpatient. These findings indicate that information on prior outpatient antimicrobial therapy has a predictive value in the diagnostic workup aimed at identifying the causative pathogen and planning the corresponding treatment in patients with pneumonia.

]. These guidelines state that following the failure of the initial empirical treatment with beta-lactam antibiotics, the microbiological examination should be reassessed with a view to excluding the less common pathogens, such as atypical pathogens, and that antimicrobial treatment covering atypical pathogens should be considered. Our study supports the choice of antimicrobial treatment covering atypical pathogens (e.g. macrolides) for all patients with CAP who are admitted to hospital after prior treatment with beta-lactam antibiotics. However, whether this protocol will result in improved clinical outcome should be subject to additional study.

]. In addition, such a mechanism can not explain the finding of an increased probability of pneumonia caused by atypical pathogens. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to specifically document and quantify the failure of initial outpatient antibiotic treatment as a predictor of the microbial aetiology of CAP.

]. In that large database study, the percentage of patients hospitalised after initial outpatient antimicrobial treatment was almost identical to that observed in our study (27 vs. 23%, respectively). In addition, age distribution, co-morbidities and the antibiotic utilisation profile of the outpatients were very similar as were the median duration of hospital stay and in-hospital mortality. Unfortunately, due to limited numbers, we were unable to study an association between prior outpatient antimicrobial treatment and mortality in our study. A very reassuring finding was that 85% of all outpatient antibiotic prescriptions complied with national guidelines on the initial treatment of adults with suspected pneumonia. This reduces the possibility that the findings, rather than being associated with antibiotics, might reflect the diagnostic acumen of the physicians who saw the patients in primary care. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that typical signs of infection with atypical pathogens may have been missed by primary care physicians.

]. On the other hand, we do not expect prior antimicrobial therapy and smoking and alcohol intake to coincide in such a way that this would result in a null effect when all the information is available.
In conclusion, among patients admitted for pneumonia, whether or not a patient has received prior antimicrobial therapy as an outpatient provides relevant information in the diagnostic workup, in particular in terms of identifying the causative pathogen and planning the initial treatment at the time of hospital admission. This finding supports a further strengthening of the continuity of care at the interface between the extramural and hospitalised settings.
