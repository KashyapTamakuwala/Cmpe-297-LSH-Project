Conclusions 
The mfERG demonstrated areas of retinal dysfunction in two carriers of XLRS. When present, retinal dysfunction was evident in the presence of a normal-appearing fundus. Multifocal ERG testing can be useful for identifying some carriers of XLRS.

]. In the current study, we evaluated the possible role of multifocal ERG (mfERG) testing as a means of detecting functional abnormalities in obligate carriers of XLRS.

Methods
Nine obligate carriers (eight parents, one offspring) of XLRS patients were enrolled in the study. They were selected on the basis of their availability and willingness to participate in the study. Each had at least one male family member who was diagnosed as having characteristic XLRS findings by one of the authors (GAF). Five of the nine XLRS patients were confirmed as having the causative gene RS1. None of the carriers had any other medical or ocular conditions that might have affected their retinal function. After each carrier was counseled regarding the study, they signed a written informed consent approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of Illinois at Chicago. The examinations were conducted in accordance with Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act regulations.

. The stimulus was displayed on a black-and-white monitor driven at a frame rate of 75 Hz (Nortec, Plymouth, MN). Each subject’s vision was optimally corrected with a refractor/camera system for the fixed viewing distance of 40 cm. To ensure equal magnification of the stimulus array, the distance between a subject’s eye and the refractor/camera was adjusted for each subject to obtain a sharp image on a control monitor. Each carrier’s pupil was dilated with 2.5% phenylephrine and 1% tropicamide to obtain a pupil diameter of at least 7 mm. Multifocal ERGs were recorded only for the right eye for each of the XLRS carriers. A Burian-Allen bipolar contact lens electrode (Hansen Ophthalmic Laboratories, Iowa City, IA) was used and grounded to the ipsilateral ear. Before insertion of the contact lens electrode, a carrier’s cornea was anesthetized with 0.5% proparacaine, and the left eye was occluded. The total recording time was approximately 8 min divided into 32 segments. All carriers were required to maintain fixation during each of 14 sec segments. Segments with large eye movements, losses of fixation, or blinks were discarded and re-recorded. The raw data were filtered at a bandpass of 10 to 300 Hz, amplified at a gain of 100,000 (Astro-Med/Gass model CP11 amplifier), and digitized at 1200 Hz. Each local response was isolated by a cross correlation between the m-sequence and response cycle according to the VERIS algorithm.

]. For the current analysis, raw waveforms were exported from the VERIS 3.0 for each of the 34 (15 male, 19 female) age-similar (30–79 years) normally sighted control subjects. Artifact reject and averaging with neighbors were turned off. Template wave forms were constructed for each hexagon from the average of all the control subjects’ data. These averaged templates were fitted using a least-squares fitting procedure to each control subject’s data by stretching horizontally (timing) and vertically (amplitude). For each hexagon, the a-scale values were then averaged across all normal subjects and standard deviations calculated. This was also done separately for the t-scale values. Each carrier’s data were then fit by the control templates and the resulting values for the a-scale and t-scale were plotted for each hexagon. For the a-scale, a number less than one indicates an amplitude lower than for the average control subjects and for the t-scale, a number greater than one indicates a timing delayed compared to the average control subjects. The statistical probability of each value was calculated using the control subjects mean and ±3 standard deviations (SD) for the a-scale and t-scale respectively and at each hexagon. The grey hexagons indicate >3 SD above the normal mean. For the 99.7% confidence level (grey hexagons) five control subjects had one abnormal amplitude and two subjects had two abnormal grey hexagons on the a-scale. For implicit time, six control subjects had one abnormal grey hexagon and two had two abnormal grey hexagons. Therefore, for this analysis, any carrier exhibiting a total of three or more grey hexagons were considered abnormal. A black hexagon indicated that a measurable signal could not be detected from the noise level. None of the 34 control subjects had any hexagons that were depicted as black. We used a criterion of two or more black hexagons for a carrier as highly likely to represent a local abnormality.

Discussion

] showed that mfERG cone-mediated responses were more impaired centrally than in the more peripheral retina in their study of seven male patients with XLRS. They also observed a higher frequency of delayed implicit times than reduced amplitudes in their patients. We did not observe either of these features in our two carriers.

]. Multifocal ERG testing may be a useful technique for the detection and monitoring of localized retinal dysfunction in some carriers of XLRS.
