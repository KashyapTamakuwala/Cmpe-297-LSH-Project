Background
Kawasaki disease is a leading cause of acquired heart disease in children. The prevalence rate varies in different ethnic groups. Recently, with the clinical application of molecular genetic technology, human leukocyte antigen (HLA) polymorphisms associated with several diseases have been identified by DNA analysis. This study aimed to assess the association of HLA alleles with susceptibility and complications of Kawasaki disease in Korean children.

Methods
In this study, DNA was extracted from 74 children with a diagnosis of Kawasaki disease. The polymorphisms of the HLA-A, -B, -C, and -DRB1 alleles of patients with Kawasaki disease were determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)–amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS) and PCR–sequence-specific primer (SSP) analysis. The polymorphisms identified were compared with those of 159 normal healthy control subjects.

Results
There was a significant increase in the frequencies of the HLA-B35, -B75, and -Cw09 alleles in patients with Kawasaki disease compared with the healthy control group. There was no increase in the frequency of HLA-DRB1 alleles among the Kawasaki disease patients compared with a healthy control group. When the patients with Kawasaki disease were divided into two subgroups, with or without coronary complications, the Kawasaki disease patients with coronary complications showed a significantly increased frequency of the HLA-DRB1*11 allele compared with the healthy control group and increased frequency of HLA-DRB1*09 in a comparison of the subgroups.

Conclusions
This study suggests that polymorphisms in some alleles of B and C in HLA class I genes are associated with Kawasaki disease in Korean children.

Our data were confined to Korean children and focused on patients who had Kawasaki disease with CC. Therefore, further research on the effect of the family history and recurrence of Kawasaki disease in association with HLA polymorphisms is needed.

Review of the medical literature on Kawasaki disease and HLA shows that there is a trend toward an association between the HLA-B loci and Kawasaki disease. However, to date, there is no confirmed relationship to a particular locus. It is likely that the HLA-B locus is not the only locus associated with Kawasaki disease. This can be the case because of its functional variation or the potential effects from other related genes around the HLA-B locus. The HLA-B locus and other associated genes might be useful genetic markers for Kawasaki disease.

For the HLA-DRB1*11 allele, the finding of a higher allele frequency compared with the healthy control group was amplified by the subgrouping of Kawasaki disease patients with and without CC. Future studies with a larger sample size are needed to confirm these findings.

].
Interpopulation discrepancies of the frequencies of HLA alleles make generalization of results difficult. Matched population profiles are needed for disease association studies because ethnic differences can provide altered disease associations.
In this study, we compared HLA alleles of Kawasaki disease patients with known polymorphic loci of HLA genes in healthy Korean adults. The results we report on the polymorphisms of HLA genes in Kawasaki disease patients may be limited to the Korean population. However, this information may be helpful in future studies on HLA genetic polymorphisms in Kawasaki disease. Further studies with a larger sample size are needed for confirmation of our findings.
