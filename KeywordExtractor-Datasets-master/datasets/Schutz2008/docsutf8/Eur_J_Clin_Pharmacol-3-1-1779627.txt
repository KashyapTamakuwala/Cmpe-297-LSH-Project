Objective
To present data on the parentally-reported use of all types of medicinal products in children from 0 to 7.5 years, in a large cohort in south-west England.

Methods
Participants in the population-based Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) have been sent self-completion postal questionnaires since they were enrolled during pregnancy. The use of medicinal products has been obtained from questionnaires sent out when the study children were 4 weeks, 54, 78 and 91 months old.

Results
The data included prescription, over-the-counter and complementary and alternative medicines. Around three-quarters of study children were exposed to some form of medicinal product before 8 weeks of age. Dermatological preparations were the most commonly used products in young babies. Activated dimeticone, for treatment of colic and flatulence, was given to 16% of babies and gripe water was used by 13%. Other commonly reported products included oral and topical antifungals and ophthalmic antibiotics. Several OTC products, not licensed for use in this age group, were reported. At each of the older ages surveyed, over 95% of children had used some form of medicinal product within the previous 12–18 months. Use of several product categories was higher at 54 months than at 78 or 91 months, such as topical steroids, analgesics (mostly paracetamol) and systemic antibiotics (mainly amoxicillin). Conversely, use of other categories, such as asthma medication, throat preparations (sprays and lozenges) and anti-inflammatory products, increased with increasing age.

Conclusion
Parentally-reported use of medicinal products in the ALSPAC study children appears to be consistent with data from other sources. The use of medicinal products by young children is high and does not always conform to the product labelling.

The primary source of data collection is via postal questionnaires about the health, development and home environment of the study children completed by each child’s main carer, usually the mother. This paper presents data obtained from four such questionnaires administered when the study children were 4 weeks, 54, 78 and 91 months old. Each of these asked questions, designed by the ALSPAC study team, about the use of medicinal products.
The 4-week questionnaire (sent out between 1991 and 1993), asked the baby’s mother to: “Please list all the ointments, pills and medicines that have been given to your baby while he/she has been at home. Check: have you included ointments to prevent nappy rash, eyedrops, herbal remedies, etc.”

For each category, the carer was asked to tick whether the response was ‘Never’, ‘Yes, for one episode only’ or ‘Yes, for 2 or more episodes’; and ‘If yes, please give full names of substances if you can’.

Are there any pills, ointments or medicines that he/she has taken every day or nearly every day for the last 3 months? (Include vitamins, skin cream, inhaler, laxatives as well as antibiotics, homeopathic and herbal remedies, etc.) If yes, please describe.

The tick box response options, the request for full name of the product, and the second question were the same as at 54 months.
After a questionnaire was sent out, if a response was not received within 3 weeks, a reminder letter was sent. If the questionnaire had still not been received after a further 2 weeks, a second reminder letter was sent. Finally, if no response had been received after 3 months, a member of the study team either rang the mother or visited her home, and encouraged or helped her to complete the questionnaire. The date of completion is included on each questionnaire, so whilst all returned questionnaires are added to the database and included in the overall response rate, those that were completed after a defined cut-off date can be excluded from individual analyses.
Most of the self-completion responses on the questionnaires are self-coding—the ticked reply box contains a printed number that can be directly keyed. However, the actual names of medicinal products used (including vitamins and supplements, herbal products, homeopathic remedies, over-the-counter and prescription products) were collected as free text responses.

.
In cases where a category of medicinal product was ticked as having been used but no further details were provided, a non-specific code for that category has been added to the database of text responses.
For the purposes of this report, all responses indicating that a product in the defined category had been used have been included, thus indicating ‘ever use’ of these categories of medicinal products rather than taking into account frequency of use.

For most of the defined categories, the number of tick box responses not supported with a text response giving the name of the product increased between the ages of 54 and 91 months (at 4 weeks, responses to the medication question were all collected as free text).
The week 4 questionnaire was completed before the child was 8 weeks of age in 10,897 cases (80% of those sent, 88% of those returned). Around three-quarters of study children were exposed to some form of medicinal product before 8 weeks of age. At this age, dermatological products were most commonly reported, mainly those for treatment and protection against nappy rash, such as ‘Sudocrem’, a proprietary product containing zinc oxide used in 29% of babies, and zinc and castor oil cream used in 22%. Simeticone (activated dimeticone) in products for treatment of colic and flatulence, such as ‘Infacol’, was given to 16% of babies. Gripe water (terpeneless dill seed oil and sodium bicarbonate) was used in 13% of the cohort. Other commonly reported products included oral and topical antifungals and ophthalmic antibiotics (mostly chloramphenicol). A few babies (2.3%) were given vitamin drops. Some were given herbal drinks (2.2%), homeopathic products (1.2%) and a variety of topical complementary and alternative medicine products, such as calendula and camomile creams (3.3%).
Several OTC products not licensed for use in this age group were reported. For example, inhalant decongestant products not licensed for children under 3 months of age—Snuffle-babe Vapour Rub (eucalyptus oil, menthol and thyme oil), Karvol Decongestant Capsules for inhalation (levomenthol with chlorobutanol, pine oils, terpineol and thymol) and Vicks Vaporub (levomenthol, camphor, eucalyptus oil and turpentine oil)— were used in over 6% of the cohort, and xylometazoline nasal spray was used on 0.6%. Calpol (paracetamol), which is licensed from 2 months, was given to over 1% when they were under 8 weeks old.

Treatments for less common conditions were also reported by this community sample. By 91 months, 6 children were using insulin, 17 reported methylphenidate (for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) and 2 reported thyroid therapy. At 54 months, 28 children reported antiepileptic medication but this had reduced to 15 children by 91 months.
Between 54 and 91 months, a very small number of children were reported to have been given an OTC medicine, whilst they were younger than the age specified on the Patient Information Leaflet or Summary Product Characteristics, for example, aspirin, ‘Dequadin’ lozenges (dequalinium chloride), ‘Night Nurse Liquid’ (paracetamol, pomethazine hydrochloride, dextromethorphan hydrobromide) and ‘Diocalm’ (morphine hydrochloride and attapulgite).

Discussion
The advantage of collecting data on children’s use of medicinal products from their parents/carers, as opposed to from medical records and prescription databases, is that the former are in a position to know what was actually given to their children, rather than what may have been prescribed but not collected or taken by the child. In addition, the data potentially includes medication obtained from all sources—GP’s, pharmacies, supermarkets, CAM practitioners, friends, relatives and neighbours. However, potential issues include the accuracy of recall (especially over long periods of 12–18 months, as used at the older ages in this study) and parental knowledge and understanding about the medicines given to their child.
12
14
10
12
], and the data from this study are consistent with this in that antibiotic use reported at 4.5 years was considerably greater than at 6.5 and 7.5 years.
12
12
]. In this study, the reported use of all ‘asthma’ medication for boys and girls combined was 120 per 1,000 at 6.5 years and 142 per 1,000 at 7.5 years. Thus, the figures from this study do not suggest a lack of recall. Indeed, at 7.5 years, the reported use of asthma medication is slightly higher than the national figures. However, as the latter combine data over a 10-year age range (5–15 years) any differences at individual ages may be masked.
Therefore, as the questionnaire data on use of prescribed antibiotics and anti-asthmatics in this study is in the range expected from prescription data, parentally-reported use of non-prescription medication in this cohort is also likely to be reasonably reliable.

]. Some products were used in children younger than the age for which they were licensed. It was not possible to assess general adherence to information given in the patient information leaflets or whether advice was sought prior to using a product outside the specifications, but parents of young children should be encouraged to follow the labelling advice or seek advice from a health professional.
4
]. Future work may also examine differences in usage by sex of the child and socio-economic status of the parents.
