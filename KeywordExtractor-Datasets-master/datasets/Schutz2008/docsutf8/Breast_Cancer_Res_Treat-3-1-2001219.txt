 = 0.0002). Prospectively planned analyses of the intent-to-treat population showed that letrozole significantly improved overall survival (OS) compared with tamoxifen over the first 24 months of the trial. An exploratory analysis of patients, who did not cross over, indicated a median OS benefit of 14 months for letrozole compared with tamoxifen. Letrozole is the only third-generation aromatase inhibitor that has demonstrated significant improvements in ORR, TTP, and early OS.

Thus, the individual trials demonstrate a trend or even a significant difference in favor of the third-generation aromatase inhibitors in one or more efficacy end points; in addition, the aromatase inhibitors were shown to be associated with improved tolerability versus comparator endocrine therapy in these randomized trials.

]. This review will describe the results of the PO25 trial, highlighting the evidence for the superiority of letrozole over tamoxifen as first-line endocrine therapy in this setting.

Trial design and patients
52
53
]. This randomized, double-blind, double-dummy trial was powered for superiority and needed to enroll approximately 900 patients to demonstrate a 20% reduction in the risk of progression with the more effective treatment. To achieve the recruitment target, the trial was conducted in 201 centers in 29 countries. Local ethics review boards approved the protocol, and all patients gave written informed consent before study enrollment.

Study design





Patient population
Post-menopausal women with advanced breast cancer, defined as stage IIIB locally advanced disease, locoregionally recurrent disease that was not amenable to surgery or radiotherapy, or metastatic disease, were eligible for inclusion in the trial. All patients presented with measurable or assessable tumors and were candidates for endocrine therapy. Patients had estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) and/or progesterone receptor-positive (PgR+) tumors or unknown HR status. One prior chemotherapy regimen for the treatment of metastatic disease was permitted, but recurrence during or within 12 months of adjuvant antiestrogen therapy and any prior endocrine therapy for advanced breast cancer precluded enrollment.

End points
The primary end point was TTP, defined as the interval between date of randomization and the earliest date of disease progression. Disease progression was determined on the basis of tumor progression (an increase of 25% or more in measurable lesions, an estimated increase of the same magnitude of nonmeasurable lesions, or the appearance of new lesions), treatment discontinuation with evidence of clinical deterioration due to breast cancer, death due to breast cancer, or death of unknown cause (with documented evidence of clinical deterioration due to breast cancer) while receiving treatment or within 6 weeks of discontinuation of treatment.
The secondary end points were ORR, duration of overall response, rate and duration of clinical benefit, TTF, time to response (TTR), time to chemotherapy (TTC), safety, and OS. ORR was defined as the proportion of patients who achieved a complete response (CR) or a partial response (PR), confirmed by a second evaluation 1–3 months later. The duration of overall response was defined for patients with CR or PR, as the interval between date of randomization and the earliest date of disease progression. The rate of clinical benefit was defined as proportion of patients who achieved CR or PR or who stabilized (NC) for at least 24 weeks; the duration of clinical benefit was defined for patients who achieved CR or PR or NC as the interval between date of randomization and the earliest date of disease progression. TTF was defined as the interval between date of randomization and the earliest date of disease progression, withdrawal, lost to follow-up, or death. TTR was defined for CR or PR patients as the interval between randomization and the earliest documentation of response, and TTC was defined as the total duration of endocrine therapy. The duration of OS was defined as the interval between randomization and death for any reason.
Exploratory analyses of OS were performed. The first analysis included all patients with censoring at crossover, whereas the second included only patients with no crossover. The latter group predominantly comprised of patients with “nonresponsive” disease (patients who responded to first-line therapy are more likely to be crossed over later at progression), whereas the former included “nonresponsive” as well as “responsive” patients.

]; therefore, evaluation of OS may be impaired if the second-line treatment is actually more effective than the original first-line treatment. Furthermore, patients who are responsive to first-line therapy are more likely to cross over than are patients with nonresponsive disease who do not obtain benefit from first-line therapy.

]. The mean costs of care were $7323 and $5468 for letrozole and tamoxifen, respectively, representing $1855 in incremental costs with first-line letrozole. Mean LYs to death or to the end of first- or second-line hormonal therapy were 1.54 and 1.29 for patients randomized to first-line letrozole or tamoxifen, respectively. Thus, the incremental cost per LY saved with first-line letrozole vs. tamoxifen was $7420 (1855/0.25 = 7420) (2.5–97.5 percentiles $6470–$14,865).
61
]. The analysis showed that the mean cost of providing first- and second-line hormonal therapy was GBP4765 for first-line letrozole and GBP3418 for first-line tamoxifen (a difference of GBP1347). Since patients receiving first-line letrozole gain an additional 0.228 LYs, or 0.158 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), the cost-effectiveness analysis showed that first-line hormonal therapy with letrozole gains additional LYs at a cost of GBP5917, whereas the cost per additional QALY gained is GBP8514, which is well within the accepted cost range.
62
]. The analysis showed an incremental cost per quality-adjusted progression-free year of CAN$12,500 and CAN$19,600 for letrozole and anastrozole, respectively, relative to tamoxifen. The authors concluded that both letrozole and anastrozole are economically acceptable alternatives to tamoxifen.

]. As demonstrated in the exploratory analysis of patients who did not cross over to the alternative treatment arm, letrozole prolonged OS by 14 months compared with tamoxifen. Thus, for every 100 patients treated with hormone therapy, eight more will be alive at 1 year if they receive letrozole instead of tamoxifen.
In conclusion, third-generation aromatase inhibitors are effective and well tolerated. Letrozole should be considered as the first-line endocrine treatment in post-menopausal women with hormone-sensitive advanced or MBC. Of the available agents, only letrozole has demonstrated significant improvements in ORR, TTP, and early OS.
