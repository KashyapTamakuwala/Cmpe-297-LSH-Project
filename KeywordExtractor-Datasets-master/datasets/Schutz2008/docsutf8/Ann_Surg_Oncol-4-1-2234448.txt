) particles are used to perform preoperative lymphoscintigraphy for SLN identification, they are retained in the SLN but are absent or present in only tiny amounts in non-SLNs. The present study investigated the potential for a novel means of assessing the accuracy of surgical identification of SLNs. This involved the use of inductively coupled plasma–mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) to analyze antimony concentrations in fine-needle biopsy (FNB) samples from surgically procured lymph nodes.

Conclusions
Our results show that ICP-MS analysis of antimony concentrations in FNB specimens from lymph nodes can accurately confirm the identity of SLNs. Used in conjunction with techniques such as proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy for the nonsurgical evaluation of SLNs, ICP-MS analysis of antimony concentrations in FNB samples could potentially serve as a minimally invasive alternative to surgery and histopathologic evaluation to objectively classify a given node as sentinel or nonsentinel and determine its tumor-harboring status.

 In addition to accurately determining the tumor-harboring status of the lymph node by this technique, it is also valuable to verify that the sampled lymph node is a “true” SLN, particularly if it has been assessed as being free of metastatic tumor.
The objective of this study was to develop a method for confirming that a FNB specimen was obtained from a true SLN by measuring the level of antimony (present in radiocolloid used during preoperative lymphoscintigraphy) in the FNB sample by ICP-MS.

Reagents and Chemicals
All reagents used were of the highest purity available. Seventy percent double-distilled nitric acid, 37% hydrochloric acid (Arastar), and 30% hydrogen peroxide were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, Australia. Ultra-high-purity water was produced by passing distilled water through a Milli-Q deionizing system (Millipore, Australia).

Standards and Certified Reference Materials
Certified reference material GBW 07601 Human Hair Powder (Langfang, China) was selected because of its certified antimony levels. Multiple samples of the reference material were also analyzed with each batch of samples and during method development to ensure the accuracy and precision of the analytic technique.

SLN Biopsy Procedure

 The location of the SLNs was marked on the overlying skin by the nuclear medicine physician to assist the surgeon in locating SLNs during surgery.
The SLN biopsy procedure was performed within 24 hours of the radiocolloid injection, so that residual radioactivity in lymph nodes could be measured intraoperatively with a handheld gamma probe (Navigator GPS, RMD Instruments, Watertown, MA). Fifteen minutes before the operative procedure, multiple intradermal injections of Patent Blue V dye (Guerbet, Roissy, France) were made around the primary cutaneous melanoma site. SLN identification was based on visualization of the nodal blue dye staining and results from the preoperative lymphoscintigraphy, with gamma probe confirmation. The experimental protocols of this study were approved by the University of Sydney Ethics Review Board in accordance with the precepts established by the Declaration of Helsinki.

 Briefly, the sample was digested in a solution containing 300 μL of nitric acid, 300 μL of hydrochloric acid, and 500 μL of hydrogen peroxide. Each sample was digested five times in a 500 W microwave oven on the defrost setting for 30 seconds each time. The digest was then quantitatively transferred to a second polypropylene tube, made up to 10 g with a 1% nitric acid solution, and assayed by ICP-MS.

 However, these large, dense carbon particles may hinder optimal histologic examination by obscuring metastatic melanoma cells. As far as we are aware, this method is not in routine clinical use.

 investigated the distribution of carbon dye in SLNs and found a high concentration of carbon particles around the point of entry of afferent lymphatic channels. It is likely that antimony exhibits an analogous distribution pattern. If so, FNB samples that fail to include this region of the SLN may contain falsely low antimony levels. In view of these factors, it would be useful to set a criterion standard for classifying a given node as sentinel or not on the basis of antimony levels assessed by ICP-MS.

 Pathologic assessment of SLNs is laborious, time-consuming, and costly, and involves examination of multiple hematoxylin and eosin–stained histopathologic sections as well as sections stained with immunohistochemical techniques. The development of a rapid nonsurgical technique that allows detection of metastatic tumor deposits would be of great benefit. It would eliminate the need for surgical excision of lymph nodes and reduce the complexity of pathologic assessment of SLNs. However, to ensure that potential false-negative results are minimized, it is imperative to ensure the accuracy of SLN identification.

 However, as far as we are aware, RT-PCR assessment of tyrosinase mRNA has not been studied in FNB samples of SLNs. A major potential problem of RT-PCR analysis of FNB samples of SLNs is the issue of false-positive and false-negative results in such specimens and this would need to be assessed before the technique could be used in clinical practice.
The results of our preliminary work provide evidence that determining antimony levels in FNB specimens by ICP-MS can confirm SLN identity and can differentiate SLNs from non-SLNs. This technique may be a useful adjunct to other techniques assessing tumor-harboring status of SLNs on FNB specimens such as MRS. Potentially, proton MRS analysis of a FNB from a node confirmed to be a true SLN by ICP-MS could provide a reliable method for determining the tumor-harboring status of SLNs. Although the results are promising and raise the possibility that SLN assessment may be performed on FNB specimens (rather than histologic specimens of excised SLNs) in the future, further validation studies are necessary before such techniques are used in widespread clinical practice. Furthermore, the highly specialized and expensive nature of the equipment used for ICP-MS will likely limit the technique to specialist centers.
