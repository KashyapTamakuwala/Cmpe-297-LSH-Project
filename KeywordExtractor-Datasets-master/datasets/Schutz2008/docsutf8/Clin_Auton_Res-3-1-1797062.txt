The effects of hypobaric hypoxia in visitors depend not only on the actual elevation but also on the rate of ascent. Sympathetic activity increases and there are increases in blood pressure and heart rate. Pulmonary vasoconstriction leads to pulmonary hypertension, particularly during exercise. The sympathetic excitation results from hypoxia, partly through chemoreceptor reflexes and partly through altered baroreceptor function. High pulmonary arterial pressures may also cause reflex systemic vasoconstriction. Most permanent high altitude dwellers show excellent adaptation although there are differences between populations in the extent of the ventilatory drive and the erythropoiesis. Some altitude dwellers, particularly Andeans, may develop chronic mountain sickness, the most prominent characteristic of which being excessive polycythaemia. Excessive hypoxia due to peripheral chemoreceptor dysfunction has been suggested as a cause. The hyperviscous blood leads to pulmonary hypertension, symptoms of cerebral hypoperfusion, and eventually right heart failure and death.

Introduction
70
] in 1966 there were approximately 140 million people living at altitudes over 2,500 m and there are several areas of permanent habitation at over 4,000 m. These are in three main regions of the world: the Andes of South America, the highlands of Eastern Africa, and the Himalayas of South-Central Asia. This review is concerned with the effects of the altitude on visitors and the ways by which the permanent high altitude dwellers have adapted to their environment.
The two main challenges to life at high altitude come from hypobaric hypoxia and the low ambient temperatures. Temperature decreases about 1°C for each 150 m elevation, so that at 4,500 m temperature is roughly 30°C lower than at sea level. Barometric pressure falls progressively with increasing altitude. Up to about 2,500 m there are few if any effects of hypoxia. Above 3,000 m some effects of hypoxia are likely to be experienced and above 4,000 m adverse effects would be experienced by most unacclimatized visitors. However, many people live and work at altitude with no apparent adverse effects. One such example is Cerro de Pasco a busy mining town of 72,000 population at 4,300 m in the Peruvian Andes, where much high altitude research has been undertaken. At this altitude barometric pressure is 450 mmHg and without hyperventilation alveolar oxygen tension would be only 34 mmHg.

Autonomic control in visitors
Most adaptive changes occur in the first days and weeks following arrival at altitude, and this is the period when acute mountain sickness with cerebral and/or pulmonary oedema may occur. Recent studies in animals and man have highlighted the role of the autonomic nervous system in adaptation and in particular the importance of sympathetic activation following high altitude exposure.
Cardiovascular effects

] demonstrated that the rate of ascent influenced the magnitude of the tachycardia. Gradual increases in altitude over two weeks resulted in larger heart rate changes compared with an abrupt ascent. Later, as subjects acclimatise at altitudes up to about 4,500 m, much of the increase in heart rate is lost and resting heart rates return towards their sea level values.

] exposed subjects to an altitude of 5,260 m for 9 weeks and then studied the effects of muscarinic blockade both at rest and during exercise, and suggested that there was an enhanced parasympathetic activity and that this was responsible for the reduction in heart rate seen during chronic adaptation to altitude.

These findings imply that acute exposure to hypoxia causes decreased parasympathetic and increased sympathetic tone and during acclimatization there is a progressive shift toward still higher sympathetic tone.

There was no difference in the gain of the baroreflex control of vascular resistance between lowland animals and animals reared at altitude (4,330 m). Set point, however, was lower in high altitude animals which seems surprising in view of the known hypertensive effect of hypoxia.

CMS patients did not respond differently from the normals, but in both groups at altitude the sensitivity of the cerebral circulation to hypoxia was less than that in sea level residents. Shortly after descent to sea level, however, sensitivity increased. Sensitivity to hypercapnia during hypoxia decreased after descent.
