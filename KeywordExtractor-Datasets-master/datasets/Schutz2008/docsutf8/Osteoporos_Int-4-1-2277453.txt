Summary
This posthoc analysis of four trials studied the efficacy of risedronate to reduce fragility fractures in postmenopausal women with osteopenia (i.e., T-scores between −1 and −2.5). Risedronate reduced the fracture risk by 73% ( = 0.023) in this population of women with low femoral neck bone mass and no prevalent vertebral fractures.

Introduction
Low bone mass represents an increasing health risk and burden. Half of fragility fractures occur in osteopenic women underscoring the need for treatments reducing fracture risk. This analysis reports the effect of risedronate to reduce fragility fracture risk in osteopenic women without prevalent vertebral fractures.

Methods
Postmenopausal women with osteopenia, defined as femoral neck T-score between −1 and −2.5 by DXA and no prevalent vertebral fractures, were identified from four controlled randomized trials (BMD Multinational, BMD North America, VERT Multinational and VERT North America). The risk reduction for fragility fractures in patients receiving 5 mg risedronate daily for 1.5 to 3 years compared to placebo was assessed. An additional sensitivity analysis excluded patients who were osteopenic at the femoral neck but had a BMD lower than −2.5 SD at the lumbar spine.

Results
Six hundred and twenty postmenopausal women with osteopenia were included, receiving either placebo ( = 309) or risedronate 5 mg ( = 311). Risedronate reduced the risk of fragility fractures by 73% over 3 years versus placebo ( = 0.023); cumulative fragility fracture incidence was 6.9% in placebo-treated versus 2.2% in risedronate-treated patients. The magnitude of the effect was similar in the sensitivity analysis subset.

Conclusion
Risedronate significantly reduced the risk of fragility fractures in postmenopausal women with osteopenia (femoral neck T-score between −1 and −2.5 SD) and no prevalent vertebral fractures.

Using data only from osteopenic women included in these trials, this study evaluated the effect of risedronate in reducing the risk of fragility fractures in women with femoral neck T-scores in the osteopenic range and without prevalent vertebral fracture.

Patients treated with estrogen and estrogen-related drugs within 3 months of study entry or for more than 1 month within 6 months of study entry were excluded from the original studies. All patients received 1,000 mg calcium and, if needed, 500 IU vitamin D daily.
Adverse event information was collected at the study visits made every 3 months during the trials. The investigator recorded adverse events reported by the patients, as well as adverse events observed on examination of the patient.

Identification of fragility fractures
Fragility fractures were defined as a composite of a patient’s incident morphometric vertebral and osteoporosis-related nonvertebral fractures (i.e., six fracture types including clavicle, humerus, wrist, pelvis, hip or leg fractures). This endpoint was chosen to include all radiographically confirmed fractures.
With respect to the nonvertebral fractures, the selection of the nonvertebral fracture sites (clavicle, humerus, wrist, pelvis, hip or leg) followed the pre-specified definition of osteoporosis-related nonvertebral fractures of the risedronate trial program, which has been reported in all regulatory and previous scientific reports from this program. All osteoporosis related nonvertebral fractures required radiographic confirmation. The term “leg” fracture as used in the risedronate trials is a summary term, including the treatment emergent adverse event codes for fibula, tibia, subtrochanteric fracture, and leg, but not those for ankle or distal tibia fracture, the terms by which ankle fractures are usually reported.

Statistical analyses
The primary analysis focused on investigating the effect of risedronate to reduce fragility fractures (both vertebral and nonvertebral) in postmenopausal women who had no radiographic vertebral fractures at baseline and were considered osteopenic based on a femoral neck T-score ranging between −1 SD and −2.5 SD.
For consistency with previous risedronate studies, the statistical analysis used time-to-first-event methodology. Cumulative fracture incidence was estimated using the Kaplan–Meier method, and a Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to estimate the relative fracture risk reduction, via the hazard ratio (HR), between the risedronate 5 mg and placebo groups. The regression model was stratified for each trial to allow for separate underlying hazard functions. In order to determine the acceptability of combining data from all trials, potential heterogeneity assessments were performed using the Cox regression model to assess the trial-by-treatment, age-by-treatment and baseline femoral neck BMD-by-treatment interactions. Fracture efficacy for nonvertebral osteoporosis-related fractures and new vertebral fractures were also investigated. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to investigate whether the exclusion of patients with lumbar spine T-score <−2.5 SD would influence the outcome of the primary analyses. As the inclusion criteria for the primary analysis were low bone mass at the femoral neck (BMD T-score between −1 and −2.5 SD), we felt it was important to test whether the exclusion of patients with an osteoporotic BMD at another site would significantly affect the results.
Adverse events, serious adverse events, withdrawals, deaths, and upper gastrointestinal adverse events were summarized by treatment group. Differences in the proportions of patients between the treatment groups were tested using the Fisher’s exact test.

Reduction of fragility fracture risk in patients with femoral neck T-score between −1 and −2.5 SD and no prevalent vertebral fractures




When separated according to nonvertebral and vertebral fractures, the cumulative nonvertebral fracture incidence was 5.4% and 0.4%, respectively, for placebo and risedronate (HR = 0.09, 95%CI = 0.01–0.71 ( = 0.022), and the cumulative vertebral fracture incidence was 4.2% and 1.8%, respectively, for placebo and risedronate (HR = 0.44, 95%CI = 0.11–1.78 ( = 0.249).

Sensitivity analyses
When patients with baseline LS spine T-scores below −2.5 SD were excluded, results consistent with those from the primary analysis population were observed, although the reduced sample size widened the confidence intervals and led to a loss of statistical significance. For the 293 patients who had both femoral neck and LS spine T-scores between −2.5 and −1 SD, the hazard ratio for fragility fractures was 0.22 (95%CI = 0.03–2.02,  = 0.182), a magnitude of effect similar to that in the primary analysis population.

Discussion

]. Results from the present study show that risedronate treatment significantly reduced the overall risk of fragility fractures by 73% over 3 years in patients with a femoral neck T-score between −1 and −2.5 and no prevalent vertebral fracture. A similar reduction in risk — that did not reach statistical significance due to low numbers — was observed when patients with lumbar spine T-scores below −2.5 were excluded from the analysis.

]. The sustained preservation of bone microarchitecture equates to a long-term beneficial effect on bone strength and may contribute to the decrease in fracture risk observed with risedronate treatment.
Limitations of the current study include the selection of initial populations in the VERT and BMD trials based on the presence of risk factors for osteoporosis (including low BMD and prevalent vertebral fractures). Because the original trials were designed to examine the efficacy of osteoporosis treatments in an osteoporotic population, rather than to determine representative incidence of fracture in a general osteopenic population, the data provided in the present analysis may reflect an overestimation of the fracture risk in the general postmenopausal population.

], and treatment with a pharmacologic agent will be indicated to lower risk. The data presented here demonstrate that in addition to the established efficacy in preventing fracture in osteoporotic women with or without prevalent fractures, risedronate significantly reduces the risk of fragility fractures in this population of postmenopausal women with osteopenic BMD values at the femoral neck and no prevalent vertebral fractures.
