. Classification of reovirus strain type 3 Dearing (T3D) required three levels of testing: general reovirus classification in level 1, serotype 3 classification in level 2, and final T3D strain classification in level 3. Strain T3SA + also required three levels of testing before a final classification was returned in level 3. Classification of strain type 1 Lang (T1L) required two levels of testing. M13K07 phage detection required only one level of testing for classification. These results indicate that automated pathogen classification using FARA is feasible. Furthermore, the simplicity of the design could be exploited for development of more complex sub-classification networks with additional levels and branches.

Introduction
Identification of specific pathogens is essential for the selection of pathogen-specific treatments, minimizing the spread of infection, and monitoring for long-term complications. Currently, specific pathogen identification is achieved through available RT-PCR and antibody-based strategies. In the clinic, these tests are usually applied consecutively to evaluate for the presence of the most likely to least likely pathogen based on patient findings. An automated classification strategy that is less dependent on clinical knowledge but achieves rapid accurate identification of a single pathogen from among a group of possible pathogens is currently unavailable.

 The filament is pulled through a series of small reaction chambers, and pathogens, if present, are captured by filament-bound antibodies. Detection of pathogen binding is achieved by using a fluorescently labeled second antibody specific for the pathogen.

 The integrated detector enables adaptive pathogen detection in which regions of interest along the filament can be reincubated in the appropriate reaction chambers to increase filament fluorescence when the initial signal is low.
In this report, we describe a small-scale test of the use of a simple classification tree together with feedback-controlled FARA to identify four viruses. The feedback feature of online FARA is used to guide the selection of subsequent tests within the classification tree. Unnecessary tests are not performed, and each subsequent test becomes more specific for a single pathogen. These results establish FARA as a robust platform for classification of diverse pathogens.

Filament Preparation

Red fingernail polish (Poisonberry, Noxel Corporartion, Hunt Valley, MO) was used as a visible and fluorescent fiducial marker to identify the leading and trailing edges of capture-antibody regions during experiments and during laser scanning. The polish was applied by pipette between the teeth of the comb flanking the antibody region. A simple bar code system was used to identify each of the three capture-antibody regions. The first and second regions were preceded by a single fiducial marker, and the third region was preceded by two fiducial markers.

). If testing proceeded to level three, fluid loss from the chambers was monitored and replenished if necessary.

Filament Control
Movement of the filament and, therefore, the antibody bands through the chambers, was achieved by using a rotary stage to wind or unwind the filament around a spindle. A small weight was attached to the opposite end of the filament to maintain a constant tension. Filament positioning to within several microns was achieved by using a rotary stage encoder from Yaskawa Instruments (Waukegan, IL) and a custom control algorithm written as a LabView Virtual Instrument (VI) (National Instruments, Austin, TX). Parameters including filament speed and residence times within chambers were controlled by using the LabView software interface.

). Long-pass filters with cutoffs at 685 nm (Chroma, Rockingham, VT) and 665 nm (Melles Griot, Rochester, NY) were combined to reduce reflected laser light from the AF647 laser. For the AF555 channel, two long-pass filters (570 nm cutoff, Melles Griot) were combined with a bandpass filter centered at 565 nm (30 nm bandwidth, Chroma) to reduce reflected light.

Classification Algorithm

Figure 3.
Decision-tree algorithm to classify virus strains. The filament control program enters the decision tree from the top at level 1 and, based on the type of virus found at each level, follows different branches of the decision tree. When reovirus is detected at level one, the filament is moved forward to the next antibody region for level 2 testing. If a serotype 3 reovirus strain is detected (T3D or T3SA+ ) at level 2, testing continues to level 3 to distinguish between these strains. 




The filament-control program was designed to find each peak, calculate its location along the filament, and make a decision about additional tests. Spatially localized fluorescence from the filament was measured as a 0–14 V signal from the transimpedance amplifier. Voltage data from the scan were used as input data by a peak-detection function in LabView. The LabView peak detector fit a quadratic polynomial to sequential sets of points depending on a width parameter entered by the user. Data were then compared to a threshold parameter, also entered by the user, to identify peaks. A binary decision to stop or continue testing was based on the location and number of peaks found. Peak-detection threshold parameters were defined as 0.3 V (approximately three times background) with a width of 30 data points, which corresponded to a width slightly larger than the physical width of the comb tooth.

 was followed. In level 1, if fluorescence was detected from the anti-M13K07 position of the first region of the filament, a classification of M13K07 virus was made, and no further testing was conducted. If fluorescence was detected in the 9BG5/5C6 region, a classification of reovirus was made and the filament was advanced to the appropriate region for level 2 testing, where a more specific test for reovirus was performed. In level 2 testing, fluorescence from the 5C6 region indicated a serotype 1 reovirus, which in this scheme corresponded to reovirus T1L. A classification of T1L represented an endpoint in the decision tree, and testing was discontinued. Fluorescence from the 9BG5 region indicated the presence of a serotype 3 reovirus, and the program advanced the filament for further subtyping in level 3. Level 3 testing used AF555 conjugated 4F2 antibody as the detecting antibody and a second detection channel with a green excitation laser. If fluorescence was found in the 9BG5 region using this channel, a classification of reovirus T3D was made and testing along that branch ended. If no fluorescence was detected from the second channel for that region, the program ended with a classification of reovirus T3SA+ .
If no peaks were found between the fiducial markers, a message was generated indicating that no virus was found. Similarly, if a peak was detected in the negative control region of the filament, a warning message was generated. Although theoretically possible, this situation did not arise during testing.

). In the first reaction chamber of the FARA approach employed in this study, capture antibody coupled to the filament was rehydrated. In this chamber the filament also was blocked to prevent non-specific binding of virus. In the second chamber, the immobilized capture antibody was incubated with virus solution. In this chamber, if virus in solution bound to antibody coupled to the filament, then the virus became coupled to the filament via this interaction. In the third chamber, non-specifically bound virus was removed by washing before incubation with a fluorescently labeled detecting antibody in the fourth chamber. A final wash in the fifth chamber removed non-specifically bound detecting antibody. The capture antibody region was then passed through an integrated fluorescence detector.

a). This finding indicated capture of the phage M13K07 by the anti-M13K07 capture antibody. For detection of M13K07, AF647 conjugated anti-M13K07 was used. Because a classification of M13K07 was made, the other two capture regions of the filament were not evaluated.

No detectable cross reactivity was found in the 5C6 antibody region or the negative-control PBS region. Thus, the virus was classified as T3SA+.

Discussion
In this study, we demonstrated the feasibility of a FARA pathogen-classification approach using a well-characterized virus system. Three reovirus strains and one phage were successfully classified by performing sequential antibody-binding assays directed by the decision tree. The structure of the decision tree was based on published characteristics of each virus strain and the known specificity of each antibody. Because the capture antibodies were arrayed at known locations along the filament, and the fluorescence of the detection antibodies was measured as a function of filament location, an increase in filament fluorescence at a particular location indicated antibody interaction with the virus. For each virus strain tested, the expected fluorescence peaks were observed, and the correct classification was made. Moreover, successful transit of all decision tree branches was demonstrated.

 As a result, 4F2 does not recognize T3SA+ and is specific only for T3D in our scheme. Since 4F2 could not be used as a capture antibody in level 3, we incorporated a fluorescently labeled 4F2 antibody as a detecting antibody in solution.

 Moreover, because the filament is mobile, the capture antibody is brought to the virus solution, thus enabling use of capture antibodies with different specificities to interrogate a single aliquot of virus solution.
Attachment of the capture antibody to a mobile filament in FARA makes accurate positioning of the filament and correct identification of the capture antibody regions essential for virus strain classification. These parameters are particularly important in multilevel testing of the type used in our study. A simple bar code system based on fluorescent fiducial markers was used to identify the leading edge of each of the capture antibody regions and position the filament in the reaction chambers. The pattern of the fluorescent marks also was used to identify the level of testing. Since our simple test system involved three levels, and testing always began in level 1, only searches for patterns containing one or two fluorescent marks corresponding to levels two and three were required. However, this simple approach allows for the incorporation of more complex bar codes using additional spots or patterns of spots.
This study demonstrates the feasibility of an automated system for diagnosing specific virus strains. Although the scheme we report is a relatively simple implementation of this system, more complex designs are possible. For example, each antibody capture region could contain additional antibodies. In addition, there is essentially no limit to the overall length of the filament, which would allow the incorporation of many additional testing regions. The sensitivity of FARA could also be increased by the use of quantum-dot labeled detection antibodies as well as a more sensitive fluorescence detection system. The most important requirement is the availability of a wide range of antibodies to the specific pathogens of interest. Such a strategy may have applications for detecting specific pathogens from complex mixtures. This approach would have both clinical and environmental applications.
