Caloric restriction remains the most reproducible measure known to extend life span or diminish age-associated changes. Previously, we have described an elevated expression of the prolyl-4-hydroxylase domain (PHD) 3 with increasing age in mouse and human heart. PHDs modulate the cellular response towards hypoxia by regulating the stability of the α-subunit of the transcriptional activator hypoxia inducible factor (HIF). In the present study we demonstrate that elevated PHD3, but not PHD1 or PHD2, expression is not restricted to the heart but does also occur in rat skeletal muscle and liver. Elevated expression of PHD3 is counteracted by a decrease in caloric intake (40% caloric restriction applied for 6 months) in all three tissues. Age-associated changes in PHD3 expression inversely correlated with the expression of the HIF-target gene macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), which has been previously described to be involved in cellular HIF-mediated anti-ageing effects. These data give insight into the molecular consequences of caloric restriction, which influences hypoxia-mediated gene expression via PHD3.

To gain more insight into the impact of nutrient availability on the adaptive transcriptional response towards hypoxia, we quantified the expression of the HIF-1α regulating PHD1–3 in heart, liver and skeletal muscle in young and old rats undergoing a well-defined protocol of caloric restriction.

The following primers were used: PHD1 sense CGTGAGGCATGTTGACAATC, PHD1 antisense AACACCTTTCTGTCCCGATG; PHD2 sense TACAGGATAAACGGCCGAAC, PHD2 antisense GGCTTGAGTTCAACCCTCAC; PHD3 sense GGCCGCTGTATCACCTGTAT, PHD3 antisense TTCTGCCCTTTCTTCAGCAT; MIF sense CAGAACCGCAACTACAGCAA, MIF antisense GAACAGCGGTGCAGGTAAGT. Each assay was performed in duplicate and validation of PCR-runs was assessed by evaluation of the melting curve. All data of mRNA are given as relative units of 18S rRNA concentrations.

Western blot
Liver tissue was rapidly homogenized in a buffer containing 50 mmol/l Tris·HCl, 1% SDS, 1 mmol/l sodium-orthovanadate, 5 mmol/l EGTA, 1 mmol/l PMSF, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin. Proteins were quantified using the bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Pierce). Protein (50 μg) in 2× Laemmli SDS sample buffer were boiled for 5 min and after centrifugation loaded onto a SDS-PAGE gel. After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane at 100 V for 90 min. The filters were blocked with 0.01% Tween, 2% nonfat milk, and then incubated with antibodies directed against MIF (Abcam) and GAPDH (Abcam).
