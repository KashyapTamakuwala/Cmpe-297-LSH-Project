Several modes of cell death are now recognized, including necrosis, apoptosis, and autophagy. Oftentimes the distinctions between these various modes may not be apparent, although the precise mode may be physiologically important. Accordingly, it is often desirable to be able to classify the mode of cell death. Apoptosis was originally defined by structural alterations in cells observable by transmitted light and electron microscopy. Today, a wide variety of imaging and cytochemical techniques are available for the investigation of apoptosis. This review will highlight many of these methods, and provide a critique on the advantages and disadvantages associated with them for the specific identification of apoptotic cells in culture and tissues.

In more recent years, evaluation of cells and tissues for apoptosis has evolved towards staining for light microscopic and flow cytometric analysis. As the biochemical and cell signaling events involved in the apoptotic cascade have been revealed, new tools for the analysis of apoptosis have emerged. Many of these tools are in the form of antibodies raised against proteins specific for the apoptotic pathway, or against neoepitopes on proteins resulting from action of an activated enzyme. While these new probes may specifically target aspects of the apoptotic pathway, they do not address the ultrastructural changes upon which the term apoptosis was originally defined.

). However, before we begin to describe these specific detection methods, we need to examine more closely the different classifications of cell death, and then delve into the mechanisms responsible for initiating the apoptotic cascade.

Classification of cell death
2007

). Autophagy is distinguished by the accumulation of cytoplasmic vacuoles and membranes, and mitotic catastrophe by multinucleation. Clearly, cellular morphological characteristics must be taken into consideration when determining the mode of cell death. This is of utmost importance when employing the TUNEL assay, since this technique stains both apoptotic and necrotic cells, which as just described display widely different morphological characteristics. This issue will be addressed in detail below.

). The apoptosome can then activate the effector caspases, such as caspase-3 and caspase-6 that ultimately lead to breakdown of cellular components. Among these is cleavage of an inhibitor of caspase-activated DNAse (ICAD) that allows the DNAse to degrade DNA. This process is fundamental to various assays of DNA breaks that are described in this review.
2001
). These pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members are located throughout the cell somewhat as sentinels that detect cellular perturbations. Upon their activation they induce aggregation and activation of Bax or Bak, which then feeds into the mitochondrial death pathway described above. Activation of the intrinsic death pathway may occur in the form of DNA damage by UV irradiation that activates p53 and then two BH3-only proteins, Puma and Noxa. Glucocorticoids similarly activate Puma and Bim that are critical to induction of cell death by steroids. In fact most chemotherapeutic agents ultimately engage a BH3-only protein in the process of killing cells. As a consequence of these pathways, several death assays measure mitochondrial integrity or membrane potential as described in this review. Additional assays might assess cleavage of caspases or their substrates.

) recently employed this approach as a means to characterize the nature of cell death in the myocardium after an ischemic event. They investigated the ultrastructural appearance of cardiomyocytes by transmission electron microscopy in failing rabbit hearts 16 days following coronary artery ligation. They described cardiomyocytes with severe nuclear derangements, peripheral coarse chromatin condensation, and prevalent mitochondrial and myofibrillar alterations. Although these ultrastructural characteristics are not typical of apoptotic cells, the cells were deemed to be apoptotic based upon an intact cardiomyocyte plasma membrane. These results would suggest that the “typical” ultrastructural features ascribed to apoptotic cells may in some instances be cell-type specific. However, further experimentation will be necessary to confirm this interpretation.

) in their efforts to improve tissue preparation and staining procedures for the TUNEL method.
The TUNEL assay maintains its popularity as a marker of apoptotic cells; it is available in a kit form, is easy to use, and has been available for a number of years, becoming entrenched in the literature. However, given the concerns raised above with its specificity for apoptotic cells, we are of the opinion that other methods should be employed concomitantly with this assay in order to make a determination that the mode of cell death observed is the result of an apoptotic mechanism.

Anti-single-stranded DNA antibody (Apostain)

) expanded upon these observations by adapting the formamide DNA denaturation followed by anti-ssDNA antibody staining technique for the electron microscopic level. They show very convincingly by immunoelectron microscopy that the TUNEL assay results in staining of condensed chromatin in mitotic and necrotic cells in addition to apoptotic cells, whereas the formamide-ssDNA technique stained only the condensed chromatin from apoptotic cells.
2001
2003
2004
). Moreover, we recently combined staining with the ssDNA antibody with a second specific marker of apoptosis in a novel dual staining method on tissue sections, as described below. In our hands, in agreement with studies described above, we find the formamide condensed DNA denaturation/ssDNA technique to be a reliable indicator of apoptotic cells in a variety of cell cultures and tissues.

Apoptosis-related neoepitopes
2001
) demonstrated the utility of using an anti-cleaved cytokeratin 18 antibody for the specific detection of apoptotic cells in culture and in archived paraffin embedded tissues. Specifically stained cells showed the shrunken condensed morphology expected of an apoptotic cell. Naturally, this antibody can only be employed for cells and tissues that express cytokeratin 18.
2002
) used a commercially available antibody raised against cleaved caspase 3 to specifically label apoptotic cells in culture and paraffin embedded tissues. Given the ubiquitous presence of caspase 3 in most cells, and the formation of the neoepitope following activation of the apoptotic cascade, this reagent should prove to be a most useful and specific label for cells undergoing caspase-mediated apoptotic cell death.

-galactose-containing glycoproteins in the plasma membrane in response to apoptotic signals. These glycoconjugates can be visualized using a battery of lectins (carbohydrate-binding proteins of nonimmune origin), in conjunction with fluorescence- or peroxidase-conjugated probes for light microscopy. Unlike most of the markers for apoptosis which bind to cytoplasmic or nuclear constituents, these plasma membrane-specific probes offer the means to assess activity occurring at the cell surface during the apoptotic cascade (similar to annexin V binding to phosphatidylserine). Given the enormous diversity in carbohydrate structure, and the role played by carbohydrates in a variety of cell–cell interactions, it is feasible that they may offer more insight into cellular mechanisms of apoptosis in the future.

They treated the human epidermoid carcinoma cell line KB with staurosporine to induce apoptosis, and determined that after a 3-h exposure, the total cell height decreased 32%, the total cell volume was decreased by 50%, and the cell diameter changed by 15%. Given the temporal experimental capabilities of AFM, it seems as if this would be an ideal modality, in combination with other imaging methods, to investigate the cellular dynamics accompanying the apoptotic cascade, as elegantly shown by Hessler et al.

) despite TUNEL positivity in hearts of animals subject to transitory ischemia followed by reperfusion for several hours.
In view of these considerations, it appears important to determine definitively whether the presence of ssDNA coupled with the presence of caspace 3 cleavage product does, indeed, map isomorphically with the cells that exhibit electron microscopic criteria of apoptosis. Furthermore, it will be important to determine the extent to which the positivity of each of these criteria of apoptosis occurs in hearts of experimental animals subjected to ischemia for selected intervals followed by reperfusion for selected intervals as well as in those from animals subjected to myocardial ischemia that is persistent and to define the time course of the evolution of apoptosis, if present, under both conditions. It is, of course, possible that apparently scanty apoptosis at any given time could be of considerable biological importance since apoptotic cells are rapidly destroyed or removed by macrophages. Thus, if a given percentage of cells, though a small one, were exhibiting apoptosis repetitively, the cumulative amount could be substantial. Accordingly, both the temporal and the spatial evolutions of apoptosis associated with myocardial ischemia and infarction require elucidation. This is particularly important because apoptosis in the heart may be secondary to necrosis rather than a primary mode of cell death, a distinction that needs to be clarified because of the disparate therapeutic implications of the two possibilities. Only when armed with information needed to characterize apoptosis in the heart more definitively will it be possible to delineate the potentially beneficial effects of tissue protective interventions designed to retard or prevent apoptotic cell death in cardiomyocytes subjected to ischemia.

Concluding remarks
2006
). We hope that this brief review has highlighted a variety of imaging modalities suitable for differentiating amongst the different modes of cell death. What should be apparent is that rarely will one method be sufficient for such a determination. Each imaging method has its own strengths with respect to the morphological information it can provide. Such morphological information, combined with biochemical or immunohistochemical assessment can provide a strong indication of the specific mode of cell death observed. The key, in our estimation, is a multiparameter observational approach.
Accordingly, the take-home message for any morphological or cytochemical investigation of apoptosis is to employ more than one detection method and run multiple controls.
