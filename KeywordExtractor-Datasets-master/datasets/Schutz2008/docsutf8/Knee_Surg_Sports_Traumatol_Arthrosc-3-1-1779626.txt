 procedure. The residual part of each membrane was tested by colorimetric assay (MTT) and histochemical and ultrastructural analyses were carried out. In all of the samples a large number of viable cells, quite homogenously distributed, was detected. The cells expressed the markers of the differentiated hyaline chondrocytes. These data reassure in that the MACI procedure provides a suitable engineered tissue for cartilage repair, in line with the clinical evidences emerging in the literature.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the distribution, viability and phenotype expression of the cells seeded on a collagen membrane just at the moment of the implantation.

 type I/III collagen membrane of porcine origin. The cell-seeded membranes were implanted in cartilage defects by means of either arthroscopic or mini-open surgery, using fibrin glue to ensure adhesion. At each implantation, the residual part of the membrane was collected and tested for cell viability, and histochemical and ultrastructural analyses were also performed.

) of each membrane, being assayed to equal 1/10 of the original culture medium volume, and incubated for 3 h. The solution was then removed and acidic isopropanol (0.04–0.1 N HCl in absolute isopropanol) was added to solubilize the stain.
The results were evaluated by means of the spectrophotometric assay (570 nm), yielding absorbance as a function of viable cell number.

Histochemical and immunohistochemical analysis
The samples were fixed by immersion in 4% para-formaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, at 4°C and then embedded in paraffin. Specimens were stained with safranin-O. For the immunohistochemistry, non-specific binding was blocked with 3% normal goat serum in a phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, for 30 min at room temperature; slides were then incubated overnight with primary antibodies at 4°C. Sections were incubated with polyclonal antibodies anti S-100 protein (Dako, Italy), a cytoplasmatic marker of chondrocyte phenotype, diluted at 1:3,000, anti-collagen type I (Monosan, The Netherlands) and II (Calbiochem-Oncogene, CA, USA) at 1:150, and monoclonal antibodies anti chondroitin sulphate (chondroitin-S) (Sigma) at 1:200. Rabbit and mouse immunoglobulins, at the same dilutions as the primary antibodies, were used as controls. After three washes with Tris–HCl (0.05 M, pH 7.6), revelation of the reactions was accomplished by DAKO LSAB + kit, HRP. Stainings were viewed and photographed with a Leica Microscope (Leica Cambridge Ltd., UK).

Ultrastructural analysis
For scanning electron microscopy (SEM), the membranes were fixed in 2% glutaraldeyde in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4), post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide, dehydrated in increasing ethanol concentrations and then CPD-dried. They were mounted on stubs and gold-sputtered. Specimens were observed with a Philips 505 microscope.

Discussion
Cell phenotype and proliferation analysis should be an essential step in the evaluation of all tissue-engineered products because the implantation of dedifferentiated or not-proliferating cells would not justify the therapeutic employment of these biotechnologies.

] confirmed that cells in ACI procedure maintained chondrocyte phenotype and showed a low apoptotic rate. To our knowledge, there is no previous reference to the analysis of the phenotype and the proliferation activity of human chondrocytes before MACI implantation. Data about cell number and viability, but not about cell phenotype and distribution are provided by Verigen’s laboratory for each implant. It should, however, be remembered that it is quite possible that the presence of a membrane like the one found in the MACI technique could interfere with cell behaviour and modify phenotype expression.

] demonstrated that cells grown in monolayer with the same culture conditions maintained a differentiated phenotype. Moreover, we felt it was important to establish the phenotypical expression of chondrocytes seeded on the I/III collagen membrane, since those are the cells that are then implanted, independently of what has taken place in the previous steps of the procedure. The positive immunostaining for S-100 protein, chondroitin-S, type II, but not type I collagen, confirms that cells maintained the characteristics of differentiated hyaline chondrocytes at the moment they were implanted.
