The utriculo-endolymphatic valve was discovered by Bast in 1928. The function of Bast’s valve is still unclear. By means of orthogonal-plane fluorescence optical sectioning (OPFOS) microscopy 3D-reconstructions of the valve and its surrounding region are depicted. The shape of the duct at the utricular side is that of a flattened funnel. In the direction of the endolymphatic duct and sac this funnel runs into a very narrow duct. The valve itself has a rigid ‘arch-like’ configuration. The opposing thin, one cell-layer thick, utricular membrane is highly compliant. We propose that opening and closure of the valve occurs through movement of the flexible base/utricular membrane away from and toward the relatively rigid valve lip.

Hypothesis
The bottom or opposing wall of the uticulo-endolymphatic (Bast’s) valve is the moving and thus functional part of the valve.

Material and methods
Specimen preparation
Two healthy female albino guinea pigs (Harlan Laboratories, UK), weighing 450 g, were used. Animal care and use were approved by the Experimental Animal Committee of Groningen University, protocol No. 2883, in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.
The animals were terminated by lethal administration of sodium pentobarbital. After decapitation the bullas were dissected and fixated in a 10% formalin solution, neutrally buffered. Then the bullas were rinsed in aqua-dest. Decalcification in ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid 10% solution (EDTA; Sigma, ED5SS, pH 7.4) took place at a temperature of 50°C in a microwave oven (T/T MEGA microwave histoprocessor, Milestone) in eight sessions of 6 h. After decalcification the bullas were again rinsed with aqua-dest and dehydrated in a graded seven-step ethanol series (30%, 50%, 70%, 90%, 96%, 100%, and 100%).

] was not sure about the valve being opened or closed in the normal situation. He writes: “As a matter of fact in many histological sections the epithelium of the valve is in contact with the opposing wall of the slit-like opening of the duct which suggests that such a closure may exist, at least at times, in the living ear.”

Conclusion
The use of OPFOS imaging techniques and graphical 3D-reconstruction of the uticulo-endolymphatic (Bast’s) valve and its surroundings has given some additional insight in its functioning. It is most likely that opening or closure of the valve occurs through movement of the flexible base away from or toward the relatively rigid valve lip.
