Summary
On a sample of 1,317 children aged 9.9 years we developed a novel method of measuring humeral dimensions from total body dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans and showed that gender differences in the ratio between humeral width and length are established prior to puberty.

Introduction
It is recognised that long bone cross-sectional area is greater in males compared to females, which is thought to reflect more rapid periosteal bone growth in boys. However, it is currently unclear whether these findings reflect gender differences in bone size or shape. In the present study, we investigated whether gender differences exist in the balance between longitudinal and periosteal long bone growth in children, leading to gender differences in bone shape, based on a novel method for evaluating shape of the humerus. We also examined whether these differences are established prior to puberty.

Methods
Length, area and width of the humerus were estimated from total body DXA scans in 1,317 children aged 9.9 ± 0.33 years, who had participated in a nested case-control study of fractures within the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) (a geographically based birth cohort based in South West England). No differences were observed with respect to parameters of humeral geometry according to fracture history, and so both groups were pooled for further analysis. Aspect ratio (AR) of the humerus was calculated as humeral width divided by length. Total body height and weight were measured at the same time as the DXA scan. Puberty was assessed using self-completion questionnaires.

 < 0.001). Similar gender differences were observed in early pubertal children (i.e. Tanner stage 2).

Conclusion
We conclude that the greater periosteal diameter of boys compared to girls reflects differences in the balance between longitudinal and periosteal bone growth. Interestingly, resulting gender differences in humeral AR are established in prepubertal children.

]. Therefore, it is possible that the greater cross-sectional area in boys compared to girls is a reflection of their larger size. On the other hand, the ratio between periosteal growth and longitudinal bone growth may be different in boys compared to girls, leading to gender differences in bone shape. However, little is known of the inter-relationships between longitudinal and periosteal bone growth, since investigation of possible gender differences in skeletal geometry have generally been confined to analysis of cross-sectional area; in the absence of techniques capable of simultaneous measurement of long bone length, it has been difficult to accurately assess how the ratio between longitudinal and periosteal growth is affected by gender and other factors such as puberty.

].
In the present study, we aimed to characterise the influence of gender and puberty on the ratio between longitudinal and periosteal growth, by exploiting this novel technique of humeral geometric analysis. In particular, we wished to determine whether, in analyses combining fracture and non-fracture controls from the study described above, gender differences exist in the ratio between width and length of the humerus, and if so whether these differences are established prior to puberty.

]. Of these births, 13,988 were alive at 12 months. The population from ALSPAC used for this study consisted of 1,290 children: those who had DXA scans performed at aged 9.9 years, had measures of humeral dimensions performed and had data on pubertal stage available. Ethical approval was obtained from the ALSPAC Law & Ethics Committee, and Local Research Ethics Committees.

Measure of size at birth
In the immediate post-partum stage, whilst mother and child were still in hospital, trained ALSPAC staff measured crown-heel length with the Harpenden Neonatometer (Holtain Ltd., Crosswell, UK). Alternatively, this measure was collected from clinical records for babies who were not captured by the ALSPAC staff.

), total body (TB) fat mass (kg) and TB lean mass (kg) were measured using a Lunar Prodigy dual-energy X-ray absorptiometer (Lunar Corp., Madison, WI, USA) on 7,444 children, using the default mode for all scans. The child was positioned carefully on the scanner and asked to lay their hands flat on the bed, palms down.

The precision of measurements of humeral geometry was calculated as the coefficient of variation (CV), based on ten scans with the measures repeated five times. The CV was 2.9% [95% confidence interval (CI): 2.1–3.7] for width, 1.5% (95% CI: 1.2–1.7) for length, and 3.2% (95% CI: 2.4–4.0) for humeral AR.

Statistical analyses
t
-test was used to test the null hypothesis of no difference in the means for boys and girls. Linear regression was used to assess the associations between gender and humerus dimensions, which were adjusted for age on the day of the DXA scan and pubertal status. Additional analyses were performed following adjustment for TB fat mass and for fracture status.

Discussion

]. In contrast, age, height and pubertal status did not influence the ratio between humeral width and length, as reflected by humeral AR, presumably reflecting the action of mechanisms to ensure that skeletal shape remains constant as bones grow. In both pre- and early pubertal boys, humeral length was found to be shorter compared with girls, whereas humeral width was similar or greater, resulting in a greater humeral AR in boys. Taken together, these findings suggest that gender, but not puberty, affects the balance between periosteal and longitudinal growth. Hence, differences in overall skeletal shape between boys and girls appear to be established prior to puberty. However, from the present study we are unable to determine whether the AR changes during later pubertal stages, or during subsequent ageing.
Our observation that Tanner stage was found to affect humeral geometry in girls but not boys presumably reflects the fact that boys and girls in Tanner stage 2 are not equivalent in terms of skeletal development. The finding that height and weight differences between Tanner stages 1 and 2 were considerably greater in girls compared to boys is consistent with this view. Therefore, analyses of differences in humeral geometry between Tanner stage 2 boys and girls may have limited validity, since these may not have fully accounted for gender differences in skeletal maturity that are likely to have been present. Nevertheless, since humeral AR was unaffected by Tanner stage in the age of children studied, these reservations are unlikely to affect the main conclusion from this study, namely that humeral AR is greater in boys compared to girls as assessed at age 9.9 years.

). Alternative measurement techniques, such as pQCT, offer advantages over the approach described here, by measuring bone diameter directly, but do not provide a measure of bone length. Another limitation of the present study is that unlike girls, age 9.9 years appeared to be too young to evaluate possible effects of early puberty on skeletal development in boys. In future studies, we plan to repeat these analyses in older boys to confirm that as in girls, puberty increases humeral width and length whilst having no effect on humeral AR.
In conclusion, we have found that long bone shape, as reflected by humeral AR which we derived using a novel technique from total body DXA scans, is unaffected by age, height and puberty, as evaluated in a child cohort of relatively narrow age range and range of Tanner stages. This finding suggests that the ratio between longitudinal and periosteal growth is controlled to ensure it remains constant during rapid growth. However, humeral AR was related to gender, suggesting that the greater periosteal diameter of boys compared to girls, which is well recognised, is a consequence of gender differences in the balance between longitudinal and periosteal bone growth. Interestingly, these gender differences in humeral AR were present in prepubertal children, possibly resulting from prepubertal differences in sex hormone levels. Further studies are justified to determine whether humeral AR is an important determinant of biomechanical strength and fracture risk, particularly in adult populations.
