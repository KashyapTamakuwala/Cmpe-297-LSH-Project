Dural arteriovenous fistulas located in the vicinity of the jugular foramen are complex vascular malformations and belong to the most challenging skull base lesions to treat. The authors comprehensively analyze multiple features in a series of dural arteriovenous fistulas with transosseous arterial feeders involving the jugular bulb. Four patients who underwent surgery via the transcondylar approach to treat dural arteriovenous fistulas around the jugular foramen were retrospectively reviewed. Previously, endovascular treatment was attempted in all patients. The success of the surgical treatment was examined with postoperative angiography. Complete obliteration of the dural arteriovenous fistulas (DAVFs) was achieved in three patients, and significant flow reduction in one individual. All patients had a good postoperative outcome, and only one experienced mild hypoglossal nerve palsy. Despite extensive bone drilling, an occipitocervical fusion was necessary in only one patient with bilateral lesions. The use of an individually tailored transcondylar approach to treat dural arteriovenous fistulas at the region of the jugular foramen is most effective. This approach allows for complete obliteration of the connecting arterial feeders, and removal of bony structures containing pathological vessels.

All patients underwent preoperative angiography and at least two attempts of endovascular embolization. For the occlusion of arterial feeders, Guglielmi electrolytically detachable platinum coils were used. The decision for surgical intervention was made after the endovascular approach proved unsuccessful in terms of complete obliteration, and the patient developed neurological deficits or intolerable symptoms of pulsatile bruit.

Case 4
 This 68-year-old female complained of progressive pulsatile right-sided tinnitus for 1 year. Neurological examination was irrelevant. An angiogram obtained at our institution furnished evidence of DAVFs at the right occipital condyle and jugular tubercle. The fistula was mainly fed by meningeal branches of the right occipital and ascending pharyngeal arteries. The patient underwent embolization of the right occipital artery, aimed at reducing the arterial supply. Due to persistent arteriovenous connection and impairment of the patient’s quality of life, surgery was subsequently performed.

Intraosseous DAVFs were also encountered around the hypoglossal canal, with arteriovenous shunts flowing into the venous plexus surrounding the hypoglossal canal, and more anteriorly in the region of the inferior petrosal sinus. To reach this area, the bony resection was extended into a deeper region. Use of the intraoperative microdoppler probe gave a good impression of the arterialization of the jugular bulb. Thus, persistence of intraosseous arterial feeders indicated that bony resection had to be continued by drilling the jugular tubercle, the occipital condyle and the jugular process. The required extent of bone removal was also estimated from preoperative imaging, and was related to anatomical landmarks such as the hypoglossal canal, the posterior condylar emissary canal and the dural entrance of the vertebral artery. Drilling was stopped only when no more arterial feeders were encountered, indicating that all feeders had been interrupted. Normalization of blood flow within the jugular bulb could be documented by using the microdoppler probe. To adequately drill the dorsomedial portion of the occipital condyle, a small portion of the lateral atlantal mass had to be resected in some instances as well. In such cases, complete exposure of the horizontal portion of the vertebral artery was necessary. However, there was no need for complete C1 hemilaminectomy. The suboccipital dura mater was not opened, since an intradural inspection of the jugular foramen was unnecessary as there were no intradural arteriovenous shunts. After meticulous extradural hemostasis, wound closure was obtained in several layers.


Results
All four patients underwent surgical obliteration of their DAVFs via the transcondylar approach. This access route provided a good exposure of the target site, and allowed occlusion of the intraosseous pathological vessels. There were no intra-operative complications, and no permanent major postoperative deficit occurred. Despite a certain blood loss during surgery, no patient required intra-operative or postoperative blood transfusion. Although an extensive resection of the involved occipital condyle, jugular process and jugular tubercle was carried out in all patients, an occipito-cervical fusion was necessary only in patient 3 with bilateral lesions. There were no additional neurological deficits, with the exception of patient 4, who experienced mild hypoglossal nerve palsy postoperatively.
Postoperative angiography was obtained in each patient to confirm obliteration of the DAVFs. Three patients showed radiological cures, with no further treatment necessary. In patient 2, the DAVFs were significantly reduced surgically, but still persisted. Therefore, a second surgical intervention was proposed to the patient, who eventually refused. While preoperative complaints disappeared in three patients, they were clearly improved in one individual.

]. To treat DAVFs, this approach was slightly modified, and primarily applied with the purpose of interrupting the pathological arterial feeders. The extent of bony resection at the skull base was, therefore, individually tailored according to the extent of arteriovenous fistulas under intraoperative microdoppler guidance.
The use of this surgical procedure was most effective, as all patients in our study showed postoperative clinical improvement, and complete obliteration of the intraosseous DAVF in three patients. Only one patient (patient 3), whose angiogram revealed residual AV fistulas, experienced previously developed mild periorbital edema. We believe that this was due to residual pathological vessels anterior to the jugular bulb, an area very difficult to reach surgically. During the removal of pathological bone containing abnormal fistulas in this patient, the dilated thin wall of the jugular bulb was slightly injured. After packing this area of venous bleeding with muscle fascia, no space for further drilling was available. A second, slightly-modified surgical intervention was, therefore, proposed to the patient to obliterate the remaining fistulas, but she refused.

]. Only in the case of extensive bony drilling within the condyle, necessary due to the large number of transosseous pathological feeders, a partial condylar fracture may occur as it happened in patient 3 of this series. However, an occipito-cervical fusion was undertaken in this patient only because she harbored bilateral intraosseous DAVFs, and a second procedure on the opposite side was required that would have significantly destabilized the atlanto-occipital region.


Conclusion
Dural arteriovenous fistulas located around the jugular foramen are a less common type of DAVFs. The suboccipital transcondylar approach is considered the best access route when surgery of this particular pathology is intended. The amount of pathological bone that must be removed by drilling depends upon the extent of transosseous arterial feeders. Surgical obliteration of this complex vascular malformation is possible, at least in the cases in which the arterial feeders do not extend too far anterior to the jugular bulb. With this surgical technique, an atlanto-occipital instability may occur in very large or bilateral lesions, requiring occipito-cervical fusion.

This is a nice paper dealing with four cases of an exceptional location of intracranial arteriovenous fistulas (AVF). These four cases were treated surgically, with apparently complete exclusion in three cases. The authors have to be commended for the quality of surgery. They were using a lateral approach in all their cases. However, this aggressive type of treatment (leading to instability of the cranio-cervical junction in one case) might probably have been avoided. Our first comment is about the analysis of the AVF, which needs a complete angiographic work-up, with global as well as superselective catheterism of every external carotid artery (ECA) and vertebral artery (VA) branches. On figures presented here, there is no selective injection, and pictures are too small for a perfect analysis of (1) all the supplying branches, and (2) the exact site of the AVF. These AVF may in fact be developed in the wall of the jugular bulb but also of some connecting veins including the marginal sinus (case 4 could be one of these last locations). Then—and as a consequence of the previous comment—if arterial embolization is chosen, it should be realized very distally after superselective catheterization of the arterial pedicles. In this report, the main trunk of the arteries using coils was embolized. This corresponds to a proximal surgical ligation which—as has been known for a long time—has absolutely no chance of success. On the contrary, it will induce the development of more collateral arterial feeders and make the treatment (whatever it is) still more difficult. Today, arterial embolization using histoacryl material is applied only in simple AVF, with one single or very few arterial feeders. Quite recently, the use of a new material (Onyx) has given some more place to arterial embolization as this material can better reach the junction between arteries and the vein of drainage. In the vast majority of cases, intracranial AVFs, most commonly located on the sigmoid sinus and the cavernous sinus, are treated from the venous side with venous occlusion. So, in the cases reported here, if the AVF is located on the marginal sinus or on the distal part of the sigmoid sinus–jugular bulb with good contralateral venous drainage, the venous drainage can be sacrified. In the cases presented here, there is no venous phase on the pictures of post-operative angiographic controls; it may be possible that for some cases the surgery has also produced a venous occlusion, which explains the operative success. If the sigmoid sinus-jugular bulb occlusion cannot be compensated by the controlateral sigmoid sinus, arterial embolization with Onyx has to be attempted; in the case of failure of this endovascular technique—and only in this case—surgical treatment can be discussed. For some patients with AVF presenting no risks of intracerebral lesions, in particular hemorrhage but complaining of tinnitus, surgery may appear too aggressive. Even for surgeons such as the authors of this paper, mastering the surgical technique of lateral approaches to the cranio-cervical junction, surgery may be considered a too important treatment. Therefore, this paper demonstrates the possibility of surgical cure of this particular location of dural AVF; however, in our opinion, with the progress of endovascular techniques, a less invasive treatment should initially be attempted.
