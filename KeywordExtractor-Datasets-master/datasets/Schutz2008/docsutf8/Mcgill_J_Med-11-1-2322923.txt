Acute renal failure is an unusual complication of wasp stings. We report two cases of renal failure after multiple wasp stings (Vespa affinis). Both patients had evidence of intravascular haemolysis, hepatic dysfunction, oligo-anuria and azotaemia and required dialysis. The first patient had severe hemolysis, rhabdomyolysis, pigment and venom nephropathy and died on the 8th day in hospital. The second patient, who recovered completely in 3 weeks time with steroid and antihistaminic therapy, had interstitial nephritis. Although acute renal failure after wasp stings is typically caused by acute tubular necrosis (ATN) in the setting of haemolysis or rhabdomyolysis, in some patients, acute renal failure may result from a direct nephrotoxic effect or acute interstitial nephritis from a hypersensitivity reaction.

Death from wasp envenomation is a rare event and results from acute renal failure (ARF) involving various mechanisms. Although ARF after wasp stings is typically caused by ATN in the setting of haemolysis or rhabdomyolysis, in some patients, renal failure may result from a direct nephrotoxicity of wasp venom or acute interstitial nephritis from a hypersensitivity reaction. We here we report two cases of acute renal failure after wasp stings (Vespa affinis).

CASE 1
Table 1
. The onset of the oliguric phase was at 12 hours postenvenomation. Chest radiograph showed right basal consolidation. He died on the 8th day following admission despite aggressive therapy with medication, blood transfusions, assisted ventilation, and 16 cycles of dialysis.

CASE 2
Fig. 1
Table 1
. He was treated with oxygen, salbutamol, chlorpheniramine, cyproheptadine, prednisolone and ranitidine. His hepatic and renal function improved gradually with fluid challenge, furosemide, mannitol, bicarbonate infusion, dopamine, and 12 cycles of dialysis in 3 weeks’ time.

OBSERVATION
DISCUSSION
Wasp stings are well-known causes of toxic and hypersensitivity reactions. Direct toxicity is rare, but has been reported in cases when a very large amount of venom is injected. Immediate hypersensitivity reactions, such as bronchospasm in the first case and an urticarial rash in the second, are known to occur. In our report, both reactions responded to steroids and antihistaminics. The second patient had swollen joints indicating serum sickness-like reaction in a sensitized individual.

).
In the first case we presented, the patient had myalgia, indicating muscle injury as evidenced by elevated CPK, LDH and AST and myoglobinuria (728 ng/ml). He also had intravascular haemolysis and haemoglobinuria. Toxic pigments might have caused nephropathy resulting in ARF. The alternative mechanism of ARF postulated was direct nephrotoxicity by massive wasp venom.

) reported for the first time that acute tubulointerstitial nephritis could lead to ARF in wasp sting cases. In the second case we present, the patient had eosinophiluria, indicating interstitial nephritis. He recovered fully with the mentioned treatment. He did not report taking any medication which might have had nephrotoxic side-effects, and no other causes of ATN could be found. Ultrasound abdomen was unremarkable. Kidney biopsy revealed proximal peritubular necrosis and eosinophilic infiltration. Hence it can be hypothesized that the ATN was caused by a hypersensitivity reaction to the wasp venom.


CONCLUSION
Wasp stings pose a great environmental hazard in Nepal and early recognition of anaphylactic shock, hepatic or renal dysfunction, rhabdomyolysis or haemolysis and rapid transport to hospital are essential steps of management to avoid fatalities. ARF due to toxic or pigment nephropathy and tubulointerstitial nephritis should be considered in any oliguric and azotemic patient following wasp attack.
