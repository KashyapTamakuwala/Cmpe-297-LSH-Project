Many adult patients require temporary inotropic support after cardiac surgery. We reviewed the literature systematically to establish, present and classify the evidence regarding choice of inotropic drugs. The available evidence, while limited in quality and scope, supports the following observations; although all β-agonists can increase cardiac output, the best studied β-agonist and the one with the most favourable side-effect profile appears to be dobutamine. Dobutamine and phosphodiesterase inhibitors (PDIs) are efficacious inotropic drugs for management of the low cardiac output syndrome. Dobutamine is associated with a greater incidence of tachycardia and tachyarrhythmias, whereas PDIs often require the administration of vasoconstrictors. Other catecholamines have no clear advantages over dobutamine. PDIs increase the likelihood of successful weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass as compared with placebo. There is insufficient evidence that inotropic drugs should be selected for their effects on regional perfusion. PDIs also increase flow through arterial grafts, reduce mean pulmonary artery pressure and improve right heart performance in pulmonary hypertension. Insufficient data exist to allow selection of a specific inotropic agent in preference over another in adult cardiac surgery patients. Multicentre randomized controlled trials focusing on clinical rather than physiological outcomes are needed.

Introduction

]. This acute deterioration in ventricular function may continue into the postanaesthesia care unit or intensive care unit (ICU). Because cardiac surgery is conducted in an increasingly aged population, with coexisting pathology, these patients are at increased risk for developing a low cardiac output syndrome (LCOS) during the postoperative period.

].
Despite a wide range of available inotropic agents, no consensus exists regarding the treatment of LCOS post-CPB. This review examines the pharmacological options for providing inotropic support in the period after CPB and evaluates the literature systematically in order to establish, present and classify the available evidence regarding the use of inotropic drugs after cardiac surgery in adults. We do not discuss exclusive or mostly vasopressor drugs such as vasopressin and norepinephrine (noradrenaline).

Methods
We conducted a systematic Medline and PubMed search, over the period 1982–2003, using the following keywords: cardiac surgery, cardiopulmonary bypass, coronary artery bypass grafting, inotropic support, epinephrine, dopamine, dopexamine, dobutamine, amrinone, enoximone, milrinone and levosimendan. Agents considered to be primarily vasopressors (e.g. norepinephrine, arginine vasopressin and phenylephrine) and mechanical support (e.g. intra-aortic balloon counter-pulsation and assist devices) are not considered. For reasons of space and the likelihood that they would behave like other agents in their class, the more obscure phosphodiesterase inhibitors (PDIs; e.g. olprinone) not in common usage in the UK and Australia are not considered.
in vitro 
studies are not included. Using this search strategy we identified 210 papers. This selection was further refined to 142 reports in which the agent in question was used for support of cardiac function or vital organ perfusion in patients who had undergone cardiac surgery. All articles in question were obtained.

). Particular attention was given to the following issues regarding each agent in patients who have undergone cardiac surgery: what are the effects of each inotropic drug on systemic haemodynamics?; does the inotropic drug alter vital organ perfusion?; does the inotropic drug affect major clinical outcomes (e.g. time spent in hospital or ICU or requiring ventilation or artificial renal support) or survival?; and does the inotropic drug have any important side effects?
Data covering the application of each therapy were examined. Where possible, 'evidence-based' recommendations were developed.

However, dobutamine was associated with significantly more tachycardia for the same stroke volume index (SVI).

No studies were found regarding the effect of epinephrine on major clinical outcomes or survival.

Dopamine
Dopamine is a naturally occurring catecholamine that binds to both α- and β-receptor subgroups, with β effects predominating at low dose and α effects predominating at high dose. Doses of 2–10 μg/kg per min are commonly used for inotropy, with doses of 1.5–3.0 μg/kg per min still used by some for renal protection ('renal dose') because of the binding of the drug to specific dopaminergic receptors in the kidney. Our literature search identified a total of 21 papers relating to the use of dopamine in cardiac surgical patients, all of which were retrieved.
None of these papers specifically compared the haemodynamic effects of dopamine with those of placebo. When the effects of dopamine on CI were compared with baseline data, dopamine at a dose of between 2.5 and 5.0 μg/kg per min produced significant increases in CI (range 16.3–57.9%). In all studies except one there was a significant rise in HR (range 4.5–45.7%).

Moreover, 63% of patients in the dopamine group had an adverse cardiac event (defined as arrhythmias, ischaemia and hypertension), which was significantly greater than with dopexamine.

] compared the efficacies of dopamine, dobutamine and enoximone for weaning from CPB in a randomized trial of 75 patients. Nine of the 25 patients randomly assigned to dopamine failed to respond adequately, and the remaining 16 recorded an increase in CI of 25.7% but this was accompanied by an increase in HR of 44.3%, with little change in SVI. The CI in the dopamine treated group was significantly lower than in patients treated with either dobutamine or enoximone.

] conducted an observational study of 100 patients who had undergone cardiac surgery and were administered dobutamine at doses of 0–40 μg/kg per min, where tolerated, and compared these with 10 control patients who received no dobutamine. Those investigators found that HR increased by an average of 1.45 beats/min per μg/kg per min in patients who were able to receive the full dose (66 out of 100 patients). Of the patients who were unable to receive the full dose, more than half (52%) developed tachycardia greater than 85% of predicted maximum HR by age. Romson and coworkers concluded that, in post-CPB patients, the dominant method of increasing CI was by increasing HR.

Enoximone
Enoximone is an imidazolone derivative phosphodiesterase-III inhibitor. It is typically used in doses of 0.5–1.5 mg/kg followed by an infusion of 5–10 μg/kg per min. It has a half-life of 2 hours in normal patients but this may be prolonged in patients with cardiac failure.

Levosimendan
There is little published work on the use of the novel calcium sensitizer levosimendan in cardiac surgical patients with LCOS. Levosimendan is a new inodilator that exerts its inotropic effect by interacting with troponin C (the binding protein for calcium) to enhance the calcium sensitivity of cardiac myocytes.
95

].


Conclusion
4
. It is evident that there are two main classes of inotropic agents that should be used for support of cardiac output after cardiac surgery: catecholamines and PDIs (data for use of calcium sensitizers in this setting is scant). Moreover, all of these agents have been demonstrated to be effective at improving myocardial contractility or HR, or both. Although some reports in the literature suggest that catecholamines are more potent inotropic and chronotropic agents, serious drawbacks associated with their use include increased myocardial oxygen consumption, tachycardia, increased afterload and arrhythmias. β-Adrenergic receptors may also be downregulated in patients with pre-existing cardiac failure. This has led to interest in the use of phosphodiesterase-III inhibitors and, more recently, the calcium sensitizer levosimendan.
Studies investigating the use of PDIs in cardiac surgery have shown them to be potent inotropes, but vasodilation is a prominent feature of their use, and so concomitant administration of a vasoconstrictor such as norepinephrine or phenylephrine is often required. Such vasoconstrictor agents may or may not have adverse effects of their own. The effects of PDIs on HR appear to be minimal, and there is evidence to suggest that diastolic relaxation and flow through arterial grafts is improved. However, because of their pharmacokinetic profile, the time of onset and offset are longer (a loading dose is required) and they have the potential to accumulate in renal failure. These features can render the PDIs clinically less practical.
2
2
n 
= 120), no convincing advantage was shown for either drug. Moreover, the observation period was only 4 hours and the outcomes were only physiological. This is disappointing because there are several theoretical advantages of PDIs over catecholamines: less tachycardia and myocardial oxygen consumption, improved diastolic relaxation, peripheral and pulmonary vasodilation, and increased IMA graft flow. On the other hand, such advantages are theoretically diminished by the need for vasopressor support.
97
], a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled trial that investigated the efficacy and safety of prophylactic milrinone in paediatric patients at risk for developing LCOS. Of the 239 patients investigated, high-dose milrinone (75 μg/kg per min followed by an infusion of 0.75 μg/kg per min) reduced the risk for LCOS by 48%. A randomized controlled study of suitable statistical power must be conducted to compare fully the benefits of PDIs with those of dobutamine in adult cardiac surgical patients, with the focus on clinical rather than just physiological outcomes.
Following our systematic analysis of the literature, we believe that – despite the limitations of the data – some recommendations can be made, each with a particular level of evidence.
• Recommendation 1 (level C). β-Agonists or PDIs are more efficacious at increasing cardiac output than placebo for the treatment of LCOS after cardiac surgery. Beta-agonists are associated with a greater incidence of tachycardia and tachyarrhythmia. Administration of a vasoconstrictor is often required with PDIs.
• Recommendation 2 (level C). Catecholamines such as dopamine, epinephrine and dopexamine have no clear advantages over dobutamine and may be associated with a greater incidence of adverse effects. Epinephrine has been successfully used as salvage therapy.
• Recommendation 3 (level C). Administration of PDIs before separation from CPB increases the likelihood of successful weaning compared with placebo, and decreases the use of catecholamines during the postoperative period. Concerns regarding amrinone and thrombocytopenia have limited its use.
• Recommendation 4 (level C). There is no evidence that inotropes should be selected for their effects on regional perfusion.
• Recommendation 5 (level C). Administration of milrinone increases flow through arterial grafts.
• Recommendation 6 (level C). Milrinone and probably other PDIs reduce mean pulmonary artery pressure and improve right heart performance in pulmonary hypertension.
We believe that the field of clinical research into inotropic support for adult cardiac surgery has reasonably established the superiority of catecholamines and PDIs over placebo. However, insufficient evidence exists to guide the choice of one group of drugs versus the other. The role of the new calcium sensitizers remains unknown. It is biologically plausible that the use of catecholamines or PDIs may lead to different clinical outcomes and the clinical scenario of LCOS is relatively common, and so suitably powered, multicentre, randomized controlled trials should be a clinical research priority in adult cardiac surgery patients.

activates the release of calcium from the SR, which by itself and through the calcium–calmodulin dependent protein kinases influences cellular processes, which in vascular smooth muscle leads to vasoconstriction. DAG simultaneously activates protein kinase C, which leads to the phosphorylation of other proteins within the cell.
