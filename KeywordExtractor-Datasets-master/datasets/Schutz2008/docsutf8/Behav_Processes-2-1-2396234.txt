Abstract
The exploratory behaviour of laboratory rodents is of interest within a number of areas of behavioural pharmacology. However, how best to measure exploratory behaviour in rodents remains a contentious issue. Many unconditioned tests, such as the open field, potentially confound general locomotor activity with exploration. The hole-board apparatus appears to avoid this confound, as head-dipping into holes in the floor is assumed to be a valid measure of the subject's attraction towards novelty (neophilia). This study aimed to investigate whether head-dipping should be considered a valid measure of neophilia by comparing performance of adult male and female Lister hooded rats on the hole-board task (a) over repeated sessions and (b) when novel objects were absent or present underneath the holes. The results show that head-dipping initially decreased across repeated exposures, while time spent in the aversive central area increased. No change in head-dipping was seen in response to objects being placed underneath the holes. Rather than being a measure of neophilia, these results support the hypothesis that head-dipping represents an escape response, which declines as the subject becomes less fearful. These results are compared with previous studies of repeated exposure to other novel environments.

Materials and methods
2.1
Subjects and housing
ad libitum
 access to rodent pellets and water. All guidelines and requirements set out in the Principles of Laboratory Animal Care (National Institutes of Health, U.S.A., Publication No. 86-23, revised 1985) and the U.K. Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 were followed.

2.2
Apparatus and experimental design
The hole-board apparatus consisted of a wooden, grey box, measuring 68 cm × 68 cm. The walls were 40 cm high, and the box was raised 28 cm above the ground on a metal stand. Four holes (4 cm in diameter) were cut into the floor of the apparatus; each hole was 28 cm from a corner of the box along the diagonal from the corner to the centre. The floor of the box was marked out into four outer areas and one central area using black masking tape. The central area was delineated by four lines of tape each 20 cm from one of the walls, while the four outer areas were marked out by diagonal lines of tape running from the corners of the floor to the corners of the central square. The four holes were thus located at the corners of the central square. The apparatus was located in a small testing room with dimmed white lighting. The stand of the apparatus was open on all sides, allowing the floor or objects to be dimly lit.
Each subject was tested ten times in the hole-board apparatus, once per day during two sets of five consecutive days (Monday–Friday and the following Monday–Friday). During the first set of five trials, no objects were present underneath the holes of the apparatus; during the second set of five trials, an object was placed on the floor under each of the four holes prior to the start of the trial, approximately 20 cm below each hole. The objects were all distinct from each other but were similar in size (approximately 10 cm in length or diameter: a black-and-white rubber ball, a purple plastic star, a red-and-white rubber pet toy, and a yellow, rubber dumb-bell shaped pet toy).
All trials were carried out between 09:00 and 17:00 h, and trials on males and females were alternated throughout the day. At the beginning of each trial, a subject was placed in one corner of the apparatus (always the corner closest to the door of the room), facing the centre of the arena. Each trial lasted 10 min. At the end of the trial, the subject was immediately placed into a carrying box and returned to the home cage. Between each trial, the floor and walls of the apparatus and the novel objects, if present, were cleaned with 70% alcohol solution.

2.3
Behavioural measurements
(i)
enter a new area: the animal moves from one area of the open field to another (all four paws had to be placed on the floor of a new area);

(ii)
head-dip: the animal places it's head into one of the holes, to a minimum depth such that the ears were level with the floor of the apparatus (a new bout of head-dipping was recorded if the animal raised it's head fully out of the hole before resuming);

(iii)
rear: the animal is stationary on it's backpaws and raises it's forepaws off the ground, extending it's body vertically.



The data on entries into a new area were used to calculate the total amount of locomotion (number of entries into all areas summed together) and the percentage of entries that were in made into the central area. The location of the animal during each of the 10-s time intervals was used to estimate the percentage of time spent in the central area.

Discussion
The aim of this study was to investigate whether head-dipping behaviour should be considered a valid measure of neophilia by comparing performance on the hole-board task (a) over repeated sessions (trials 1–10) and (b) when no objects were present (trials 1–5) and when objects were placed underneath the holes (trials 6–10). The results show that head-dipping was high during the first test, decreased over the following two trials and remained relatively stable during the rest of the experiment. The initial drop in head-dipping following the first trial could be interpreted in two ways. First, head-dipping could be indicative of a neophilic response that decreases as the animal becomes familiar with the apparatus, i.e. head-dipping represents directed exploratory behaviour that drops as the apparatus loses its novelty. If this interpretation is correct, we would also predict that head-dipping would be greater in the presence of objects; however, there was no evidence of an increase in head-dipping behaviour when objects were present underneath the holes. These results do not support the hypothesis that head-dipping is a valid measure of neophilia.
Renner, 1990
Márquez et al., 2005, 2006
Belzung and Griebel, 2001
), these results contradict the assumption that head-dipping behaviour is suppressed by an anxiety-like response, in which case we might have expected head-dipping to vary in the opposite direction to anxiety-like behaviour.
Gagliano et al., 2008; Mayeux-Portas et al., 2000; Nolan and Parkes, 1973
Nolan and Parkes (1973)
Nolan and Parkes, 1973
). Again, these results do not support the idea that head-dipping provides a valid measure of neophilia, rather than a neophobic response induced by an unfamiliar test situation.
Lever et al., 2006
Bilkei-Gorzó and Gyertyán (1996)
. This study reported that the effects of the anxiolytic benzodiazepine chlordiazepoxide on head-dipping behaviour in rats varied with the light intensity during testing, such that treatment decreased head-dipping in very bright light and increased head-dipping under normal light. The authors argued that head-dipping during the aversive testing condition (bright light) represents an attempt by the subject to find an escape route from the apparatus, while head-dipping in less aversive conditions represents visual exploration of the apparatus. Future studies could investigate whether head-dipping increases with extended familiarisation to the apparatus even in the absence of novel objects, and whether head-dipping increases when novel objects are brought closer to the holes, when new novel objects are placed under the holes for each test, or when objects are re-located beneath different holes.
Cook et al., 2002; Dawson et al., 1994; Rodgers et al., 1996
). In contrast, in our study, no change of overall locomotion was found on repeated exposure to the hole-board, and the amount of time spent in the aversive central area of the hole-board apparatus increased over sessions. The reason for the differences in the behavioural effects of repeated exposure to these two types of novel environments may be related to differences in the design of the two types of apparatus. Repeated exposure to an elevated maze, which consists of open areas and closed areas, may have resulted in the subjects retreating into the darker, closed arms once an initial investigation had found no potential escape routes from the apparatus; such a response was not an option in the hole-board test. If a shelter were added to the hole-board apparatus, locomotion might be predicted to decrease over repeated exposure, with subjects choosing to remain under a shelter once potential escape routes had been investigated.
Aguilar et al., 2003; Ray and Hansen, 2004
Garey et al., 2001; Morgan and Pfaff, 2002
Morgan et al., 2004
Cortright et al., 1997; Eckel and Moore, 2004
), and, as discussed above, head-dipping may not represent neophilic behaviour. Therefore, the conclusion that females are more exploratory or neophilic than males should not be drawn from such data.
Welker, 1957
Greenberg, 2003
). For researchers interested in rodent exploration, simple measures, such as head-dipping, are unlikely to expose by themselves the complex interaction between these two factors.
