Functionally active complement system and complement regulatory proteins are present in the normal human and rodent eye. Complement activation and its regulation by ocular complement regulatory proteins contribute to the pathology of various ocular diseases including keratitis, uveitis and age-related macular degeneration. Furthermore, a strong relationship between age-related macular degeneration and polymorphism in the genes of certain complement components/complement regulatory proteins is now well established. Recombinant forms of the naturally occurring complement regulatory proteins have been exploited in the animal models for treatment of these ocular diseases. It is hoped that in the future recombinant complement regulatory proteins will be used as novel therapeutic agents in the clinic for the treatment of keratitis, uveitis, and age-related macular degeneration.

In addition, the studies discussed below demonstrate the importance of interplay between complement activation and complement regulation in the development of vision-threatening complications such as keratitis, uveitis, and macular degeneration.

The aforementioned observations have important clinical implications. If in future anti-complement agents were to be considered for the treatment of corneal pathology, anaphylatoxins would be an ideal target for the patient presenting with chemical injury such as exposure to acid or alkali. On the other hand, in the case of bacterial infection both anti-anaphylatoxin and anti-MAC therapy should be considered. Although as discussed below the cornea possesses the ability to express different CRegs to protect itself from complement-mediated damage, it may not be able to upregulate various CRegs to an appropriate level during an acute episode of complement activation as observed during chemical insults or acute bacterial infection. In such cases, topical application of recombinant CRegs could be beneficial and serve as a better alternative for intervention.

]. Furthermore, when the function or expression of CRegs was inhibited in vivo, more severe EAAU with early onset and delayed resolution was observed. These observations demonstrate that ocular tissue can protect itself by upregulating various CRegs during uveitis and provide strong evidence for the use of recombinant CRegs as therapeutic agents in the treatment of autoimmune uveitis.

]. In these transgenic mice, EAU was not completely suppressed. This may be due to relatively low levels of Crry expressed compared with the levels that are required for the complete inhibition of the complement system. It is possible that a higher dose of exogenous Crry or similar CReg may result in complete inhibition of EAU.
Thus, these studies provide strong evidence that the complement system and CRegs play an important role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune uveitis and provide alternative approaches for the development of effective therapy. More research in the future will present us enough information to develop anti-complement therapy for uveitis. Hopefully, in the future, complement inhibitors might be used as novel anti-uveitic agents in the clinic for the treatment of this important form of human ocular disease.

]. This increase in plasma C3a des Arg concentration reflects systemic complement activation. Thus systemic activation of the complement system may also contribute to the pathogenesis of AMD.

]. Unfortunately, these treatment options have limitations due to their short-term and serious side effects. Although, photodynamic therapy (PDT) reduces the rate of vision loss in most patients, it does not lead to significant improvement in vision. Furthermore, repeated PDT can cause severe damage to the posterior segment of the eye and is not cost effective. Two drugs Lucentis and Macugen are approved by Federal Drug Administration for the treatment of AMD and both drugs inhibit vascular endothelial growth factor. One of the major drawbacks of Lucentis or Macugen is that repeated injections of these drugs are needed to treat AMD. Repeated injections can cause some serious side effects including hemorrhage of the eye membrane, eye pain, and vitreous floaters. Therefore, alternative therapeutic strategies with minimum side effects are required to better treat AMD patients. We believe that the results derived from the studies reviewed above would open up the window of opportunities for the development of anti-complement therapy in the treatment of AMD.
In view of important developments relative to the role of the complement system in AMD during the past several years, we believe that the next decade would be critical for such studies. We hope that the interest will continue to grow in the future so that an alternative therapy could be developed by inhibiting complement activation. Since untreated CNV leads to the irreversible loss of central vision, it is important for the pharmaceutical companies to utilize the knowledge available to them from different research laboratories and should make every effort to transfer this knowledge to develop new drugs and therapies for AMD patients.

Conclusions and clinical implications
During the last decade, a lot of progress has been made to understand the pathophysiology of corneal diseases, uveitis, and macular degeneration. Specifically, the studies defining the role of the complement system in ocular diseases have drawn a lot of attention. It is an exciting area for future investigations and the basic questions such as what triggers the complement activation and which specific pathway is involved in corneal diseases, uveitis and macular degeneration need to be addressed. This understanding will help us to develop better therapies for ocular diseases in the future so that blindness could be prevented.
The evidence derived from the studies reviewed here supports the concept that recombinant complement regulatory proteins may be therapeutically useful in the prevention of ocular tissue damage and in the treatment of various ocular diseases. Agents that specifically inhibit the complement system or complement activation products have been proven beneficial in the treatment of both human and experimental diseases over the past few years. Thus, the therapy based on complement inhibition has great potential in the future for the treatment of various ocular diseases such as keratitis, uveitis, and macular degeneration.
