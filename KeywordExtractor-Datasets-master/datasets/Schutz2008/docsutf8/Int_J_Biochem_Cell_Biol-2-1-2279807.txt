Abstract
The eEF1A1 and eEF1A2 isoforms of translation elongation factor 1A have 98% similarity and perform the same protein synthesis function catalyzing codon-dependent binding of aminoacyl-tRNA to 80S ribosome. However, the isoforms apparently play different non-canonical roles in apoptosis and cancer development which are awaiting further investigations. We hypothesize that the difference in non-translational functions could be caused, in particular, by differential ability of the isoforms to be involved in phosphotyrosine-mediated signalling.
in vitro
 was compared. Indeed, contrary to eEF1A1, eEF1A2 was able to interact with SH2 domains of Grb2, RasGAP, Shc and C-terminal part of Shp2 as well as with SH3 domains of Crk, Fgr, Fyn and phospholipase C-gamma1.

in vitro
 was revealed.
Thus, despite the fact that both isoforms of eEF1A could be involved in the phosphotyrosine-mediated processes, eEF1A2 apparently has greater potential to participate in such signalling pathways. Since tyrosine kinases/phosphatases play a prominent role in human cancerogenesis, our observations may gave a basis for recently found oncogenicity of the eEF1A2 isoform.

 identified eEF1A as a novel binding partner for Akt2 rho-associated kinase. In most cases it is not known whether interactions of eEF1A with protein kinase might lead to phosphorylation of eEF1A. Neither has the role of eEF1A in signal transduction pathways been identified.
Kahns et al., 1998
Amiri et al., 2007; Anand et al., 2002
). How eEF1A2 isoform is involved in malignant transformation is not as yet understood. Since tyrosine kinases are prominent players in cancer development, direct comparison of the ability of eEF1A1 and eEF1A2 to be involved in phosphoTyr-specific signalling processes could help to interpret cancer-related properties of eEF1A2.

Materials and methods
2.1
Cell lines and plasmid constructs
HEK293 cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and grown according to their instructions. To produce eEF1A1 and eEF1A2 stable cell lines pcDNA 3.1 eEF1A1 and eEF1A2 with the C-terminal His-tags were linearized by MunI and transfected in HEK293 cells using ExGene500 (Fermentas) according to manufacturer recommendations. G418 was used to select stable cell lines.

2.4
Pull down assay
Gout et al., 1993
). In a pull down assay, 1.5 μg of GST, GST-SH2 or GST-SH3 domains fusion protein was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed to remove unbound proteins and incubated at 4 °C for 3 h with 1.5 μg of purified eEF1A1 or eEF1A2. Non-specific interactions were removed by extensive washing and bound proteins eluted by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer. Eluted proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and detected by immunoblotting with specific antibodies.

g
 for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was incubated with 10 U of CIAP at 37 °C for 1 h, in control samples sodium orthovanadate was added to final concentration 1 mM.

2.6
Immunoprecipitation
g
 for 15 min at 4 °C. Endogenous protein complexes were immunoprecipitated from 0.5 mg of total cell lysates with corresponding antibodies (1 μg/probe) and immobilized on protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). Immune complexes were washed three times with the lysis buffer and used for immunoblotting. As a loading control Western blotting (WB) of total cell lysate with anti-β-actin has been used. The effective serum starvation (24 h in medium without serum) and stimulation (10% FBS, 30 min) has been confirmed in WB of total cell lysates with antibodies against phosphorylated residues S240/S244 in ribosomal protein S6, which is phosphorylated by S6K1/2 (effector kinases in PI3K/mTOR pathway) in response to growth factors stimulation.

2.7
Immunoblot analysis
Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and incubated for 1 h with blocking solution (2% BSA, Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween-40). After blocking the membranes were probed 2 h at 4 °C with anti-GST, anti-eEF1A (Upstate Biotechnology), anti-His tag (Cell Signalling), anti-Shp2 (Cell Signalling) or anti-pTyr 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology) antibodies. After extensive washing with the solution of Tris-buffered saline and 0.1% Tween-40, the membranes were incubated with secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody for 1 h at room temperature. The antigen–antibody complexes were detected using the ECL system (Millipore). When immunoblots had to be re-probed, the membranes were initially stripped and re-blocked prior to incubation with another type of primary antibody.

Results
3.1
Existence of SH2/SH3 domain binding sites in the eEF1A1 and eEF1A2 molecules are predicted by bioinformatic analysis
Obenauer et al., 2003

). However, the SH3 recognition motif specific for Src kinase and adaptor protein Crk was found only in the eEF1A2 molecule. This is an important indication of the possibility of differential involvement of eEF1A2 in the formation of signalling complexes.

However, since both identified tryptic peptides contained phosphoTyr29 or phosphoTyr141 (which are identical in eEF1A1 and eEF1A2) and the overall search was limited by the peptides containing phosphotyrosine, the unambiguous identification of the phosphorylated isoform in that case was hardly possible.

Schematic representation of potential SH2 and SH3 interaction sites of eEF1A1 and eEF1A2. Predicted sites were identified by ScanSite search of eEF1A1 and eEF1A2 peptide sequences: core amino acids are indicated. Y: tyrosine kinase phosphorylation site; SH2: SH2 domain binding site; SH3: SH3 domain binding site.



Fig. 2
Interaction of eEF1A1 and eEF1A2 with different GST-SH3 and GST-SH2 domain fusion proteins. GST-SH2 (A) or GST-SH3 (B) fusion proteins were coupled to glutathione-Sepharose beads and incubated with purified eEF1A1 (upper panels in A and B) or eEF1A2 (lower panels in A and B). The beads were washed extensively and the proteins were eluted by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer. Eluted proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by immunoblotting with anti-eEF1A antibodies (0.2 μg of purified eEF1A1 or eEF1A2 were loaded as controls). Amount of the GST-SH2 (A) or GST-SH3 (B) fusion proteins was controlled by immunoblotting with anti-GST antibodies. As a control, non-specific binding of eEF1A1 (upper panels in A and B) or eEF1A2 (lower panels in A and B) to GST alone or to beads alone has been analysed.



Fig. 3
eEF1A1 and eEF1A2 form complexes with Shp2. (A) Complexes of His-tagged eEF1A1/eEF1A2 and Shp2 were precipitated from HEK293 stable cell lines using NiNTA sepharose. NiNTA sepharose beads were washed extensively and complexes were eluted by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer. Eluted proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by immunoblotting with anti-Shp2 (upper panel) or anti-His (lower panel) antibodies. NiNTA sepharose beads incubated with lysate of GFP overexpressing stable cell line were used as a control of non-specific binding of Shp2. TCL: total cell lysate. (B) Complexes were immunoprecipitated with anti-eEF1A antibodies from HEK293 cells treated under different conditions (growing, serum starved and serum starved followed by 30 min 10% serum stimulation). Protein A sepharose beads were washed extensively and the complexes were eluted by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer. Eluted proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by immunoblotting with anti-Shp2 antibodies. Protein A sepharose beads alone incubated with the same cell lysates were used as a control of Shp2 non-specific binding. Total cell lysates (TCL) of HEK293 cells were immunobloted with phosphospecific antibodies to phosphorylated Ser240/Thr244 in ribosomal protein S6 and β-actin to control the efficiency of treatment conditions and total protein amount used for immunoprecipitation in each sample, respectively. (C) GST or Shp2 GST-SH2 fusion proteins were coupled with glutathione-sepharose beads and incubated with phosphatase treated (10 U CIAP per 350 μg of total cell lysate) or untreated total cell lysates of stable cell lines overexpressing His-tagged eEF1A1 or eEF1A2 proteins. The beads were washed extensively and the proteins were eluted by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer. Eluted proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by immunoblotting with anti-His antibodies (upper panel). Amount of GST or Shp2 GST-SH2 proteins in each probe was controlled by immunoblotting with anti-GST antibodies (lower panel).

. (A) 0.5 μg of purified eEF1A1 and eEF1A2 was immunobloted with anti-phosphotyrosine-specific antibodies (4G10) followed by WB with anti-eEF1A antibodies (upper panel). SDS-PAGE of purified eEF1A1 and eEF1A2 visualized by Coomassie staining, 1 μg of each protein was loaded per line (lower panel). (B) NiNTA sepharose beads with precipitated eEF1A1/eEF1A2 proteins were divided on two samples, the first was treated with 5 U CIAP at 37 °C for 1 h, second was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h in the presence of 1 mM NaOVa. NiNTA sepharose beads were washed with the lysis buffer two times; proteins were eluted by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Phosphorylated eEF1A1 and eEF1A2 were visualized by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine-specific antibodies (4G10) (upper panel) followed by WB with anti-His tag antibodies (lower panel).
