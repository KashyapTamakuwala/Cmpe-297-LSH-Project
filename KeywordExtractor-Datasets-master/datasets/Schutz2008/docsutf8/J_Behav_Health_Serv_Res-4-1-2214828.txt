Data from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration’s Integrated Database (IDB) were used to examine the service use patterns of individuals with possible opiate use disorders in Washington State. Results indicate that regardless of Medicaid enrollment status, individuals who received mental health (MH) or substance abuse (SA) services only through state agencies received no inpatient substance abuse service. Furthermore, when compared with individuals who received at least one MH/SA service through Medicaid, those who received services only through the state agencies were less likely to have received any MH services and were more likely to have received residential SA services. This analysis highlights the importance of using integrated client data in providing a more comprehensive understanding of services to inform policy and raises significant questions about how regulatory requirements affecting different funding mechanisms might drive settings of care in ways not related to the care needed.

 Given these findings and the major public health concerns caused by opiate abuse and dependence, the lack of information about the broader MH/SA treatment service patterns of individuals with an opiate use disorder is a critical gap in the knowledge base informing policies affecting this population.
16
 Therefore, examining the MH/SA treatment service use patterns of individuals with opiate use disorders during this period can provide an especially relevant baseline for today’s policy makers as they attempt to address issues surrounding the emergence of new opiates.

Data and Methods
17
18
 In addition to service use information, the IDB contains information on patient demographics (e.g., age, gender, race/ethnicity), Medicaid enrollment status, MH/SA diagnosis and service codes, and limited provider information.
Study population
International Classification of Diseases
9th Revision
Clinical Modification
 (ICD-9-CM). ICD-9-CM codes of 304.0 or 305.5, including any subclassifications, were used to identify opiate dependence and abuse, respectively. State-specific provider codes were used to identify opiate treatment providers. Both standard [e.g., Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS)] and local procedure codes were used to identify opiate treatment services. Finally, drug-of-choice information was available from self-reports obtained by state agencies during client intake. In some cases, the drug-of-choice information was obtained more than 1 year before or after any SA or MH service provision, but these cases represent less than 3% of the sample.
Preliminary analyses revealed that very few agency service records include diagnosis codes, but most Medicaid records do. Further investigation revealed that this is not an issue of Medicaid requiring a diagnosis for eligibility, but rather an issue of the data systems themselves. Agency services do not require a diagnosis code for reimbursement, so agency data systems do not track diagnosis. Conversely, Medicaid services often require a diagnosis for reimbursement, so Medicaid data systems track diagnosis. Because the presence or absence of a diagnosis is almost completely confounded by the use or nonuse of Medicaid services, information on service use differences associated with an opiate use disorder diagnosis is not presented.

Client classification
Any Medicaid service: individuals who have at least one Medicaid MH/SA service record, regardless of whether they have MH/SA state agency service records

Agency services only with Medicaid enrollment: individuals who have at least one MH/SA state agency service record and were Medicaid-enrolled at some point between their first and last observed MH/SA service record but have no record of receiving an MH/SA service through Medicaid

Agency services only without Medicaid enrollment: individuals who have at least one MH/SA state agency service record and were not Medicaid-enrolled at any time between their first and last observed MH/SA service record

 group may have received any number, or even the majority, of their services through the state agency, preliminary analyses indicated that individuals who received both Medicaid and agency services were more similar to those who received only Medicaid services than they were to those who received only agency services. For this reason, individuals receiving any Medicaid service were combined into a single category.

 for a detailed definition of the primary MH/SA diagnosis category).
The IDB client classification does not incorporate information on secondary diagnoses unless a primary MH/SA diagnosis is also present, nor does it incorporate drug-of-choice information from state agency intake records. Because both of these pieces of information were used to identify individuals with an opiate use disorder for this study, it is possible for individuals with an opiate use disorder to be classified as MH-only or having received no MH/SA service based on the IDB client classification.

Service classification
20
21
17
 The vast majority of individuals with a possible opiate use disorder have at least 1 SA service record, but relatively few have MH service records; therefore, the IP, residential, and OP subclassifications were examined for SA service records but not for MH service records.

Service encounters
An individual’s total number of service encounter dates was defined as the count of unique dates within the MH/SA service window on which the individual had a record with at least one service of a given service category (MH, IP SA, residential SA, or OP SA). Within a single IP or residential stay, each daily service encounter date was counted separately. Using standard IDB definitions for the full SA population, this same information is presented for the broader SA population, excluding individuals with an indication of an opiate use disorder.


Methods
To characterize the level of contact individuals with an opiate use disorder have with the public treatment system, the analysis examined four key domains: (1) the proportion of clients using services, (2) the median length of the service window (i.e., the length of time between an individual’s first and last MH/SA service), (3) the number of days of Medicaid enrollment within the service window, and (4) the number of unique MH/SA encounter dates within the service window.

Implications for Behavioral Health
This analysis examined the service use patterns of individuals with an indication of an opiate use disorder using IDB data from Washington for the period 1996 through 1998. Among individuals with opiate use disorders, the receipt of at least one MH/SA service through Medicaid appears to be positively associated with IP SA service use in that only individuals who met this condition had any record of an IP SA service. The receipt of at least one MH/SA service through Medicaid was also positively associated with OP SA service and with MH service use among individuals with opiate use disorders. The use of only state MH/SA agency services, on the other hand, was positively associated with the use of residential SA services.
The findings suggest that the regulatory restrictions faced by state agencies and Medicaid may drive observed patterns of care for individuals with opiate use disorders. Specifically, the finding that agency-only MH/SA service use is associated with higher rates of residential service use and with no IP SA service use is likely tied to regulatory differences between Medicaid and the state agencies in Washington. For example, SA block grant funds, which are a key source of funding for both DASA and MHD, could not be used for IP hospital care during the period covered by this analysis. This restriction most likely induced state agencies to route patients for whom outpatient care is insufficient to residential care. Similarly, the Medicaid Institutions of Mental Disorders exclusion prohibits payment for psychiatric services received by adults in residential care facilities with more than 16 beds and so may induce providers to route more severe patients to IP care rather than to residential care. This explanation suggests that using administrative data to track service use patterns may be misleading because the collection of service data is driven by regulatory environments and billing systems that may not capture the actual intensity of care given.
The results are subject to several limitations. First, although the IDB represents one of the most comprehensive cross-system databases used to examine this critical issue to date, it does not capture all possible services that could be used by individuals with possible opiate use disorders in Washington. Other possible sources include self-pay, private insurance, and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) system, among others. Another important limitation common to all administrative databases is that the actual treatment need of the population studied is unknown, so definitive statements cannot be made about the appropriateness of the services received. Furthermore, because of the limited time frame of the IDB, data are unavailable for individuals who used MH/SA services either before 1996 or after 1998. As a result, it is possible that this study has not captured the full service use history of some individuals who appear in the treatment system briefly at the beginning or end of the study period. A final limitation of this study is that information on prescription drug use is not available in the agency service records contained in the IDB and is therefore not considered in this study.
Despite these limitations, the analysis of service use patterns of individuals with possible opiate use disorders during the late 1990s offers key implications for today’s policy makers as they attempt to address issues surrounding the emergence of new opiates. First and foremost, if policy makers are trying to track the service use of a small but important segment of the overall SA population, using integrated data is a necessity. When funding for treatment services is cut in an effort to contain costs, it is important to determine if those services have simply been shifted to other state programs, reflecting little net cost savings for states overall. The present study combines state MH/SA agency data with state Medicaid data, but including additional data sources (e.g., VA or criminal justice system) would provide an even more complete picture of service use patterns. Second, the utility of administrative data for analyses such as these is often limited by the influence of the regulatory environment, clinical practice patterns, and the institutional history of the data systems used. Given that state and federal policy makers increasingly rely on administrative data to assess the performance of the treatment system, the results clearly highlight the need to better track service provision. SAMHSA’s IDB, therefore, represents the vanguard of a new, expansive, cross-agency philosophy regarding administrative data sources and serves as a model for new and more comprehensive data integration efforts.


Funding for this study was provided by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. Valuable comments and suggestions on this research were provided by members of the Integrated Database Technical Expert Panel, which comprises a wide variety of researchers and treatment providers from several state and federal agencies.
