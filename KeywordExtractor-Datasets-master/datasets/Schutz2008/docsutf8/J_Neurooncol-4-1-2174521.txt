 RNA levels were significantly higher in the tumors with 17q gain or i17q. Immunoblots confirmed significant WIP1 protein in primary tumors, generally higher in those with 17q gain or i17q. Under basal growth conditions and in response to the chemotherapeutic agent, etoposide, WIP1 antagonized p53-mediated apoptosis in medulloblastoma cell lines. These results indicate that medulloblastoma express significant levels of WIP1 that modulate genotoxic responsiveness by negatively regulating p53.

]. Despite clinical advances, up to 30% of children with medulloblastoma experience tumor progression or recurrence, for which no curative therapy exists. The lack of more effective, less toxic therapies stems from our imperfect understanding of the molecular processes that underlie medulloblastoma growth.

]. Seven tumors displayed classic histology, 11 were uniformly desmoplastic, nodular, or well-differentiated, seven were predominantly anaplastic or large cell, an additional seven displayed some degree of anaplasia or large cell histology, and one was regarded as none of the above.
Ten patients were female and 23 were male. The mean age at diagnosis was 82 months (median 79 months) with four patients less than 36 months old (range: 12–216 months). The median and mean time of follow-up was approximately 42 months from diagnosis. The majority of patients were M0 (non-metastatic), while one was M2 and eight were M3 stage at diagnosis. All studies were performed according to the institutional guidelines of Texas Children’s Hospital, and with the approval of the Institutional Review Board of Baylor College of Medicine.

. Etoposide (VP-16) and cisplatin (CDDP) were applied to cell cultures as media-diluted stock solutions in PBS and DMSO, respectively (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). Ultraviolet (UV) irradiation was performed by exposing cell cultures using a GS Gene Linker UV Chamber (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA).

 copy number status, we analyzed 100–200 individual interphase nuclei for each case. The presence of copy gain or amplification was indicated if more than 10% of tumor nuclei displayed an increased copy number relative to the chromosome 17 centromeric probe signals and/or tumor ploidy. In cases in which there was a discrepancy between the number of centromeric signals and ploidy, the ploidy number was used to estimate the relative copy number.

Human adult cerebellar (Stratagene) and human fetal cerebellar RNA samples (BioChain, Hayward, CA) were also assayed to provide tissue controls. Amplification products were verified by analyzing melting curves, agarose gel electrophoresis, and with direct sequencing of PCR products.

EDTA, 2% β-mercaptoethanol). Lysates were stored at −80°C and separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Pall Life Sciences, Ann Arbor, MI), and immunoblotted using standard methods. Primary antibodies included: WIP1 monoclonal antibody (Trevigen, Gaithersburg, MD), Phospho-p53 serine-15 (Ser15)-specific monoclonal antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA), p53 monoclonal antibody (DO-1, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and β-Actin monoclonal antibody (Sigma). Staining with secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor 680-nm-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG, Invitrogen) was visualized using an Odyssey infrared imaging system (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, Nebraska). Intensity of immunostaining was quantitated using ImageQuant 5.2 (Molecular Dynamics, Piscataway, NJ). Expression of target proteins in each sample was internally normalized to β-actin (determined on re-probed blots), relative to expression in the MCF-10A cell line.

]. In each transfection, the expression and reporter plasmids were supplemented by empty vector plasmid (pcDNA3.1, Invitrogen) to achieve an equivalent total DNA concentration.
For flow cytometry, the EGFP-expressing pMaxGFP plasmid (Amaxa, Gaithersburg, MD) provided transfection controls. For functional assessment of in vitro p53 activation, cells transfected with luciferase-encoding reporter plasmids were harvested and processed for dual color luciferase assay according to manufacturer’s recommendations (Promega, Madison, WI), and quantitated using a BenchMark Plus plate spectrophotometer (Bio-Rad).

 Cells were also counter-stained with PI for DNA quantification. FITC signal was detected on one channel in the logarithmic mode, while UV fluorescence (PI) was recorded in the linear mode on a separate channel. For each measurement, at least 10,000 cells were analyzed. We used CellQuest software for multi-parametric calculations and analyses. Cutoff negative and positive cells resulted from FITC-fluorescence isotype control measurements for each sample.

Overall, Western analysis indicated significant levels of WIP1 protein expression in primary tumors, generally higher in those with 17q gain or i17q, which might be responsible for antagonizing p53 activation.
