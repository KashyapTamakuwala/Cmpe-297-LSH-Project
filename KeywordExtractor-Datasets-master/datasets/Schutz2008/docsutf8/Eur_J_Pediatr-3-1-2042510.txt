Variability in severity among different respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) seasons may influence hospital admission rates for RSV-induced lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) in young children. The aim of the present study was to identify through logistic regression analysis, risk factors associated with higher likelihood to acquire RSV-induced LRTI, in children with symptoms severe enough to lead to hospital admission. Over four consecutive RSV seasons (2000–2004), records from children <4 years of age admitted for RSV-induced LRTI (“cases”) were compared with those from children with LRTI not due to RSV and not requiring hospitalization (“controls”). 145 “case-patients” and 295 “control-patients” were evaluated. Independent from the severity of the four epidemic seasons, seven predictors for hospitalization for RSV infection were found in the bivariate analysis: number of children in the family, chronological age at the onset of RSV season, birth weight and gestational age, birth order, daycare attendance, previous RSV infections. In the logistic regression analysis, only three predictors were detected: chronological age at the beginning of RSV season [aOR = 8.46; 95% CI:3.09–23.18]; birth weight category [aOR = 7.70; 95% CI:1.29–45.91]; birth order (aOR = 1.92; 95% CI:1.21–3.06). Conclusions: Independent from the RSV seasonality, specific host/environmental factors can be used to identify children at greatest risk for hospitalization for RSV infection.

The aim of the present study was to use the data collected to identify, by means of logistic regression analysis, risk factors associated with higher likelihood to acquire RSV-induced LRTI in children with symptoms severe enough to lead to hospital admission.

]. The study protocol was approved by the local ethics board of each hospital and written informed consent was sought from parents or guardians of all children evaluated. Medical history and physical examination were recorded and evaluated and clinical assessment, including nasal secretion specimens for RSV detection, were obtained according to the usual protocol at each hospital. Nasal secretion samples were sent to the microbiology laboratory of each hospital to check for RSV by an immunoenzymatic test (TestPack RSV, Abbott, Italy) within 24 hours. Other respiratory viruses were not tested. All children were treated according to standardized protocols and the decision to admit a child to hospital for a respiratory illness was made by local non-study physicians responsible for each child’s care and was not influenced by the child’s participation in the study.

Statistical analysis and data definitions
Descriptive statistics of the characteristics of the patients were performed and reported in terms of mean and standard deviation (SD) for the quantitative variables (chronological age, birth weight, gestational age, etc.) and in terms of absolute frequencies and percentages for the qualitative variables. Firstly, a bivariate analysis was performed and the comparison of quantitative variables between two groups of subjects (i.e. cases vs controls) was made calculating the likelihood ratio test (LR test), and reporting the bivariate odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Comparison of frequency data was performed by the chi-square test or by the Fisher’s exact test in case of expected frequencies less than five.
P
 value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The statistical packages used were the “Statistica release 6” (StatSoft Corp., Tulsa, OK, USA) for bivariate analyses and the “Stata release 7” (Stata Corporation, College Station, TX, USA) for multivariate analyses.


Results
Patient populations
There were 145 case-patients included in the study (plus three cases not evaluated because of missing values). There were 61 males (42.1%) and 84 females (57.9%), with a median age of 3.5 months and a median birth weight of 3,050 grams. Seventeen of the 145 (11.7%) were born preterm (at less than 36 weeks of gestational age), two had congenital heart conditions and five had a previous history of chronic lung disease.

Risk factors associated with a higher likelihood to acquire RSV-induced LRTI, severe enough to lead to hospital admission
In the bivariate analysis we considered several risk factors that could be associated with a higher likelihood to acquire RSV-induced LRTI, severe enough to lead to hospital admission.

Discussion
Evaluating data collected over four consecutive years in Italy, we found that, in addition to the severity of the RSV epidemics in a specific year, a variety of risk factors were associated with a higher likelihood to acquire RSV-induced LRTI, severe enough to lead to hospital admission. The only condition related to demographic and social characteristics of the family was the number of children in the family (being at least the second baby was a “risk-factor”). Among factors related to the characteristics of the children, major predictors were chronological age of the child at the onset of RSV season, birth weight and gestational age category, birth order, daycare attendance and previous episodes of RSV infections. However, in the logistic regression analysis, only three predictors turned out to be significant: chronological age at the beginning of RSV season, birth weight category, and birth order.

In the present study, gestational age, a strong risk factor in the bivariate analysis, was not included in the logistic model because of the strong autocorrelation with birth weight. Indeed, a great proportion of children belonging to two lower gestational age categories (<33 weeks and 33–35 weeks) had a birth weight <2,500 grams.

]. An interesting finding of the present report is that a low birth weight, corrected or uncorrected for gestational age, was a strong predictor for severe RSV-induced LRTI.

], exposure to tobacco smoke at home has decreased during recent years in Italy as a result of anti-smoking campaigns and better health education, and this may explain our surprising results.
Due to the low number of children with specific characteristics, other risk factors such as presence of chronic lung diseases or of congenital heart diseases, immunodeficiency, haematological malignancies, bone-marrow or organ transplants, and cystic fibrosis were not analysed. Moreover, since only in the second, third and fourth RSV season a limited number of children had received immunoprophylaxis with palivizumab, its protective effect could not be evaluated.
In summary, evaluating four RSV seasons, characterized by inter-annual alternation of minor and major epidemics, we found, in addition to prematurity, a limited number of other conditions which appear to influence the severity of RSV-induced LTRI in infants and young children. However, before translating to clinical practice these indications, other similar studies performed in different countries are required, including a broader number of children and covering other RSV epidemic seasons. This information should be valuable to better determine hospital resource management and individualize RSV prophylaxis programs in preterm and term infants.
