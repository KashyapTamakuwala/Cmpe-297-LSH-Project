Peroxiredoxin 6 is an antioxidant enzyme and is the 1-cys member of the peroxiredoxin family. Using two-dimensional electrophoresis and Western blotting, we have shown for the first time that, in human control and brain tissue of patient’s with Alzheimer’s disease (AD), this enzyme exists as three major and five minor forms with pIs from 5.3 to 6.1. Using specific cellular markers, we have shown that peroxiredoxin 6 is present in astrocytes with very low levels in neurons, but not detectable in microglia or oligodendrocytes. In control brains, there was a very low level of peroxiredoxin 6 staining in astrocytes that was confined to a “halo” around the nucleus. In AD, there were marked increases in the number and staining intensity of peroxiredoxin 6 positive astrocytes in both gray and white matter in the midfrontal cortex, cingulate, hippocampus and amygdala. Confocal microscopy using antibodies to Aβ peptide, tau and peroxiredoxin 6 showed that peroxiredoxin 6 positive astrocytes are closely involved with diffuse plaques and to a lesser extent with neuritic plaques, suggesting that plaques are producing reactive oxygen species. There appeared to be little astrocytic response to tau containing neurons. Although peroxiredoxin 6 positive astrocytes were seen to make multiple contacts with tau positive neurons, there was no intraneuronal colocalization. In brain tissue of patients with AD, many blood vessels exhibited peroxiredoxin 6 staining that appeared to be due to the astrocytic foot processes. These results suggest that oxidative stress conditions exist in AD and that peroxiredoxin 6 is an important antioxidant enzyme in human brain defenses.

]. This enzyme is bifunctional with 80% of its function as a peroxidase and the remainder as a phospholipase A2. Peroxiredoxin 6 has not specifically been examined in brain tissue of AD patients, and the aims of this study are to examine the molecular forms, cellular distribution and association with AD pathology. This study focused on the cingulate, amygdala, hippocampus and cortical regions in six AD and six control brains.

2D polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE)
Isoelectric focusing
Isoelectric focusing was performed on 13 cm immobilized pH gradient strips (pH 4–7NL, Amersham Pharmacia) using an IPGphor (Amersham Pharmacia) isoelectric focusing unit. Samples were applied in gel rehydration (50 V, overnight) using 7 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 4% CHAPS, 0.5% dithiothreitol, 0.5% pharmalyte pH 4–7 with a trace of bromophenol blue as the re-swell buffer with a total loading volume of 280 μl including sample. Stained gels received a 400 μg protein load and Western blotting gels received a 200 μg load. IEF was performed for ∼60 kV h (500 V 30 min, 1,000 V 30 min, 1,000–8,000 V 30 min, 8,000 V 5–7 h, 1,000 V hold to end).

SDS PAGE
SDS PAGE was performed using 12.5% acrylamide gels. Immobilized pH gradient strips were incubated in SDS equilibration buffer containing 1% w/v dithiothreitol for 15 min followed by SDS equilibration buffer containing 4% w/v iodoacetamide for 15 min. Strips were then placed above the second dimension gels and overlaid with 1% low melting point agarose in Tris glycine gel running buffer. Electrophoresis was performed at 350 V for 2.5–3 h at 10°C. Protein gels were visualized using SYPRO ruby fluorescent stain (incubated for 2 h) and scanned using a Typhoon 9400 Variable Mode Imager (Amersham Biosciences).


Western blotting

 for 2 h. After blocking, the membranes were incubated in affinity-purified rabbit antiperoxiredoxin 6 antibodies (1/2,000) overnight at 4°C followed by goat antirabbit alkaline phosphatase antibodies (1/10,000) (Sigma) for 1 h and visualized using ECF substrate and a Typhoon 9400 Variable Mode Imager.

Colocalization of peroxiredoxin 6 and AD pathology
The major defining pathology in AD is the presence of extracellular plaques and intracellular hyperphosphorylated tau in the form of tangles. Plaques are present in brain tissue at different stages of development, ranging from diffuse plaques to fibrillar and neuritic plaques. It is generally considered that diffuse plaques do not contain tau, but neuritic plaques contain both Aβ and tau. Colocalization of peroxiredoxin 6 and the Aβ peptide, a major component of plaques, and tau was carried out to determine if peroxiredoxin 6 positive astrocytes were associated with AD pathology.

]. Aβ-treated cells contained an extra acidic form, which was suggested to be the result of oxidation of the catalytic cysteine to a sulfenic, sulfinic or sulfonic derivative. We found two minor acidic forms in AD tissue, which is also consistent with this report.
Tissue selection is also a variable that needs to be considered. While the AD tissue had all the hallmarks of AD pathology and was easy to define, age-matched control tissues are somewhat more variable. All the control tissue was from people without clinically defined AD, but most brains in this age group usually contain some neurodegenerative pathology. The age span of the two groups was similar, 59–84 years for the AD group and 61–86 years for the control group, but the mean age for the control group was 7 years older. We feel confident that, although some control tissue may have had some elements of subclinical AD pathology, the reduced level of astrocyte activation and the clear differences in the cell counting would indicate that all the control tissues were not experiencing high levels of oxidative stress as compared to the AD tissue.
30
]. We have now used cellular markers to other brain cell types to show that in addition to astrocytes there is a low level in the cytoplasm of most neurons. Unlike astrocytes, neurons do not appear to have increased peroxiredoxin 6 staining in AD tissue. We could not detect any peroxiredoxin 6 staining in microglia or oligodendrocytes.
F
 values of 89.0 and 14.5, respectively. Considering that the major pathology (plaques and tangles) is located in the gray matter, it would be expected that oxidative stress is more pronounced in this area. Cell counting indicated that the peroxiredoxin 6 positive astrocyte numbers were elevated in all regions examined, suggesting that the insult activating astrocytes is wide spread and not confined to any specific region in either the gray or white matter. Indeed, extracellular plaques were observed in all regions examined in AD tissue. Although all regions examined showed astrocyte activation, this was not uniformly distributed through all areas, with some areas showing extensive astrocyte activation while adjacent areas were similar to controls.

]. At this stage, we are not sure of the net benefit to neural tissue of activated astrocytes with elevated levels of peroxiredoxin 6, concomitant with the increased production of nitric oxide.
Neurofibrillary tangles comprising hyperphosphorylated tau were observed in many regions in AD tissue. Two antibodies were used to localize tau, a monoclonal antibody (Novacastra) and one specific for paired helical filaments (Santa Cruz) and both produced a similar staining pattern. Neurons containing tau were not surrounded by activated astrocytes as were the diffuse plaques and to a lesser extent the neuritic plaques, suggesting that these cells are not secreting toxic or activating products that are stimulating to astrocytes. In PD, Lewy bodies contained a dense core of peroxiredoxin 6 staining suggesting that it was trying to detoxify oxidative stress produced by Lewy bodies, but we did not observe any interaction between tau and peroxiredoxin 6 in AD tissue. Although there is considerable evidence to implicate oxidative stress in the hyperphosphorylation of tau, this does not appear to upregulate peroxiredoxin 6 in tau positive neurons.

]. The blood brain barrier consists of the capillary endothelial cells, and the foot processes of the astrocytes and the fused basal lamina of both cells. The peroxiredoxin 6 staining within the capillaries appears to be in the foot processes of the astrocytes. Whether this increased staining is due to ROS generated from within neural tissue or reflects a more systemic pathology derived from the circulation is unclear.
In conclusion, we have shown for the first time the range of peroxiredoxin 6 variants, which are either isoforms or post-translational modifications in human brain tissue. We have also shown that peroxiredoxin 6 is primarily an astrocytic enzyme with very low levels in neurons and is not detectable in microglia or oligodendrocytes. This enzyme is markedly elevated in astrocytes in both white and gray matter in AD. Strongly staining peroxiredoxin 6 astrocytes appear to be involved in the detoxification of diffuse plaques and to a lesser extent in neuritic plaques, but is not associated with tau aggregations within neurons. From this work and previous work on PD and dementia with Lewy bodies, we suggest that peroxiredoxin 6 is a major antioxidant enzyme in human neural tissue.
