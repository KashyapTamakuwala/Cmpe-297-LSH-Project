Introduction
Floral life span depends on the fate of the petals. In several species the end of floral life span is due to petal withering or wilting. The petals in most of these species desiccate, and finally abscise or fall due to growth of the fruit. Only in a few species the desiccated petals remain attached to the fruit. In another large group of species the end of floral life span is determined by abscission of petals that are mostly or fully turgid.

. In both species the petals abscise without any visible sign of turgor loss. We used DNA degradation (measured both on agarose gels and by using flow cytometry), chromatin condensation, and a decrease in nuclear diameter as parameters that indicate PCD. According to our hypothesis these parameters would not detectably change, prior to petal abscission.

). The time to petal abscission and petal desiccation was observed daily, on plant material in the growth chamber. The timing of these symptoms was noted in six flowers from two plants. All determinations were made using petals that were collected from plant material in the chamber.

).
Two biological replications, each containing several petals, were used for each stage of development. Depending on the species, two to several petals were used in each sample.

Flow cytometry
The petal was chopped in nuclear extraction buffer, part of the kit (High Resolution kit) for plant DNA analysis (Partec, Münster, Germany), a reagent set provided by the manufacturer of the flow cytometer used (Ploidy Analyzer, Partec). The extraction buffer in this kit was a low pH solution containing Triton X-100. The extract was filtered through 50 μm nylon mesh. The medium with the isolated DNA masses (nuclei) was collected, the buffer with the fluorescent DNA stain 4, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) from a standard reagent set (Partec) was added, and the solution was vortex mixed. The DNA content of the isolated nuclei was analysed using the flow cytometer. The flow cytometer apparatus can be set to count all nuclei in a sample, and can be set to analyse a fixed number of nuclei. We here set it to detect 5,000 nuclei. DNA levels were obtained in a total of 5,000 nuclei. It should be noted that the large histogram peak was adjusted to 10 on the fluorescence scale. This means that nuclear condensation was not taken into account in the flow cytometry data.
Two biological replications, each containing several petals, were used for each stage of development. Depending on the species, three to several petals were used in each sample. In each species, the number of petals was the same at all stages of development.

Nuclear morphology; chromatin condensation
Nuclei were isolated from petals in the same way as for flow cytometry. Isolated nuclei were stained with DAPI, which stains DNA. The nuclei were observed under a fluorescence microscope (model PROVIS AX70, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) using U-excitation (330–385 nm). Digital photography of nuclei was obtained for each stain using low light cool CCD camera (model DP30BW, Olympus).

Dehydration and ethylene treatment
Flowers were excised when the petals were fully open. Cut flowers were placed in air in the growth chamber (24°C, about 70% RH) or in a desiccator (at 60°C). For ethylene treatments, stems of cut flowers were placed in sterile distilled water, in a closed 70 l clear plastic box containing 2 μl/l ethylene. Petal abscission was checked at hourly intervals and abscised petals were collected immediately. The petals were then used instantly for the measurement of the various parameters mentioned.

Dehydration of petals cut at flower opening
Flowers were harvested just after opening and subjected to a dehydration treatment at 60°C for 24 h. The treatment resulted in a petal FW of about 20% of that of controls. Preliminary experiments showed that such a treatment resulted in a decrease of FW, and in changes of other parameters such as DNA degradation and nuclear morphology, that were very similar to dehydration on the laboratory bench (about 20°C and 70% RH) for about 96 h.

b, S1–S4) the nuclear morphology after the dehydration treatment was quite different from the one observed during normal PCD. During PCD of petals that remained attached to the plant the area of the nuclei became increasingly smaller, whereas the brightness of DNA fluorescence remained high at least until the nuclei had become quite small.

 are in agreement with it. The data suggest that the degree of PCD, prior to abscission of turgid petals, depends on the species. The present data indicate that abscission of fully turgid petals may coincide with an advanced stage of PCD in many petal cells. The absence of visible wilting in abscising petals, therefore, does not seem to show absence of PCD. This is so because the wilting that is often associated with PCD is quite a late stage in the PCD process.

 petals. In these experiments flowers were cut from the plant just after floral opening and then subjected to a desiccation treatment (24 h at 60°C). This treatment, apart from inducing dehydration, also involved an increase in temperature. The effects did not seem to be due to high temperature though, as preliminary experiments had shown that 72–96 h desiccation at room temperature had the same effects as 24 h treatment at 60°C. This indicates that the effect was due to dehydration rather than high temperature, and that it was not only taking place in cells that were relatively old, but also in much younger cells.

The desiccation treatment, therefore, induced changes quite different from those observed during PCD: a large nucleus with faint DAPI fluorescence rather than a small one with bright fluorescence.

. Dehydration of the petal cells, after abscission, was associated with a remarkable change in nuclear morphology and chromatin distribution. Similar changes in the nucleus were found after dehydration of younger petal cells, and after dehydration of the petal cells in two other species. This nuclear morphology has apparently not been described previously.
