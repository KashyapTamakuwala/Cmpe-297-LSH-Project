Purinergic P2 receptors are a class of plasma membrane receptors that are express in many tissues and are ligated by extracellular nucleotides [such as adenosine triphosphate (ATP), adenosine diphosphate (ADP), uridine 5–triphosphate (UTP) and uridine 5–diphosphate (UDP)], which are released as a consequence of cell damage, cell stress, bacterial infection or other noxious stimuli. According to the molecular structure, P2 receptors are divided into two subfamilies: P2X and P2Y receptors. The P2X receptors are ligand-gated channels, whereas P2Y receptors are G-protein-coupled seven-membrane-spanning receptors. Several studies indicate that nucleotides play an important role in immune response modulation through their action on multiple cell types, including monocytes, mast cells, dendritic cells, neutrophils, and eosinophils. Recent work by our group and others identified extracellular nucleotides as chemotaxins for various human immune cells, including eosinophils, neutrophils and dendritic cells. In this review, we summarise recent findings in this field and put forward a hypothesis on the role of P2 receptors in the early recruitment of human immune cells to the site of inflammation.

] Hence, in tissues, nucleotides are able to generate concentration-dependent gradients, which can serve as chemotactic signals for different immune cells, causing migration.

]. Because increased extracellular nucleotide concentrations are associated with cell damage/injury and human neutrophils are the initial cell type found at tissue injury sites, the conclusion could be drawn that extracellular nucleotides among other mediators are involved in the recruitment of neutrophils to the site of inflammation.

], UDP [through its action on dendritic cells (DC)] might be indirectly involved in the recruitment of these cells to the side of inflammation. However, at this time, no information on the chemotactic activity of nucleotides on human monocytes/macrophages is available.

]. In addition, during maturation, functional down-regulation of chemotaxis-regulating P2Y receptors are uncoupled to chemotaxis-associated signal transduction pathways. As a result, DCs lose sensitivity to inflammatory chemokines as well as to the nucleotides ATP, ADP, UTP and UDP.

], so again, UDP might be indirectly involved in the recruitment of neutrophils, eosinophils and CD16+ NK cells to the side of inflammation.
In sum, activation of DCs by extracellular nucleotides leads to multiple cell responses, which results in a direct migration of DCs and also maybe indirect (DC-mediated) recruitment of other immune cells to the site of inflammation.

Conclusion
Over the last few years, several studies have implied that extracellular nucleotides which are actively released or diffuse out of mechanically stressed, infected or injured cells might be involved in the early recruitment of immune cells to the site of inflammation/cell damage. In these in vitro experiments, it has been shown that extracellular nucleotides (mainly by activating P2YR subtypes) are direct chemoattractants for human neutrophils, eosinophils and DCs and/or they can modulate the chemokine production of eosinophils, monocytes and DCs, which might then influence the migration capacity of other immune cells. However, whether nucleotides play a role in the migration of immune cells in vivo still remains to be elucidated.
