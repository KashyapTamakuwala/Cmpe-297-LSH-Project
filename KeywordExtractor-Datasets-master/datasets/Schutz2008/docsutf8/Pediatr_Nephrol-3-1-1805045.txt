The incidence of recurrence of nephrotic syndrome/focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (NS/FSGS) is variable (~30%)

The incidence of recurrence is less in African-Americans than in whites and Hispanics

Graft survival rates are decreased in recipients with FSGS, especially if remission of the NS is not achieved in those with recurrence

Although controversial, the use of living donor (LD) transplants are not contraindicated; however, obligatory heterozygote parental grafts with a podocin mutation should be used with caution

Optimal treatment to induce a remission post-transplant has not been delineated

Pre-transplant and/or prophylactic post-transplant pre-operative plasmapheresis (PP) for high-risk patients—especially those with recurrence in a previous graft—may be promising

An international multicenter controlled study is required to delineate the optimal approach to prevent and/or treat the recurrence of NS/FSGS

Introduction
Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is a histologic (pathologic) diagnosis that encompasses numerous specific clinical entities with potential varied etiologies. Steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS) is a specific clinical phenomenon that may vary histologically from minimal change nephrotic syndrome (MCNS) to FSGS, but it also may be associated with other specific histological diagnoses.

The purpose of this teaching review article will be to address the factors that influence the incidence of recurrence of NS/FSGS in renal allografts, establish the known risk factors for recurrence, and delineate the current preventive and therapeutic approaches to the recurrence of NS/FSGS in pediatric renal allograft recipients.

Do patients with the glomerular tip lesion who receive a renal allograft manifest recurrence of the NS?
11
] reported that 12 of 14 recipients whose native kidney manifested the glomerular tip lesion had clinical recurrence of the NS post-transplant. In all 12 recipients, the glomerular tip lesion was the only histologic abnormality on graft biopsy. These data support the concept that the glomerular tip lesion may be the earliest histologic abnormality in the NS/FSGS spectrum of disease. Precise incidence and outcome data await subsequent reports.

Does race impact on the recurrence of NS/FSGS?

Plasmapheresis was associated with both a reduction in the Palb activity and in urinary protein excretion.

Therefore, advocating the restriction of induction therapy to reduce the incidence of recurrence awaits the performance of a multicenter prospective randomized controlled study.

What are the therapeutic options available to produce a remission following the recurrence of NS in recipients with FSGS?
32
] reported the remission of NS in two pediatric recipients following nine sessions of PP at 3 and 6 months post-transplant. Both recipients manifested prolonged ATN. This led to the general use of PP in patients with recurrence. However, no randomized control trial was ever performed and the rate of remission has been variable.
33
] in 1990 reported the success in inducing a remission with high-dose cyclosporine in three pediatric recipients. The rationale for the increased dosage was that hyperlipidemia bound the cyclosporine and higher doses were required to achieve adequate bioavailability. The precise dose and length of treatment with the “high-dose” regimen were never delineated in a controlled trial. However, this report led to the general approach of using a higher maintenance dosage of cyclosporine once a remission was obtained.
34
] reported a recurrence rate of 67% (16/24) in recipients with FSGS between 1991 and 2003. The oral dose of cyclosporine was increased to 24 mg/kg/day until either remission was achieved or renal toxicity was evident. Complete remission was achieved in 69% (11/16) within 14 days to 19 months (10/11 within 3 months) and 12% (2/16) had a partial remission. Concomitant PP was administered to 7/16 recipients with recurrence.
35
] in 1993 introduced a regimen of PP and cyclophosphamide in three patients who remitted within 12–24 days. This regimen has been adopted by some centers, especially for patients who failed to remit with PP alone. However, again, no controlled trial has been performed.
36
] in 1994 for recipients with an identified circulating factor. Although proteineuria was reduced in the eight patients treated, it was permanent in only one patient following discontinuation of the procedure. Subsequent reports utilizing this technique in pediatric recipients are limited.
37
] reported an 82% (14/17) remission rate utilizing IV Cyclosporine at 3 mg/kg/day to reach a cyclosporine level of 250–350 mg/dl. These data add to the potential utility of high-dose cyclosporine in inducing a remission following the recurrence of NS/FSGS.
With the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme/angiotensin receptor blocker (ACE/ARB) therapy to reduce proteinuria in patients with various forms of renal disease, it would seem logical to extend the use of these agents to recipients with the recurrence of NS/FSGS. However, there has been no controlled study of the use of these drugs either alone or as adjunctive to other therapeutic regimens.

Can pre-operative PP reduce the risk of recurrence of NS/FSGS?
38
] in 2001 reported the recurrence of NS/FSGS in 9/21 grafts. Pre-operative PP was performed in 15 and recurrence developed in five, whereas 4/6 without pre-operative PP developed recurrence. The authors concluded that pre-operative PP was effective in preventing the recurrence of NS/FSGS.
39
] from the UCLA reported a recurrence rate of 100% in three recipients of DD grafts who received one session of pre-operative PP, whereas it was 57% (4/7) in recipients of LD grafts who received <5 pre-operative PP and 0% in three recipients who received >5 pre-transplant PP sessions. The authors concluded that >5 pre-operative PP sessions prevented the recurrence of NS/FSGS.
40
], at the same IPTA congress, reported a recurrence rate of 15.4% (2/13) in LD recipients who received 1–2 pre-operative PP sessions, as well as native kidney nephrectomy. Recurrence was evident at 6 days and 8 months post-transplant, respectively, and remitted with post-transplant PP.
7
]. The LD recipients received eight courses of PP over a two-week period—one week prior to and one week following transplantation. The DD recipients initiated PP within 24 hours of transplantation and continued for two weeks post-transplant. There was no recurrence in the four recipients with rapid progression to ESRD and 3/6 recipients with a recurrence in a prior graft had no recurrence.
Certainly, the utilization of pre-operative and prophylactic post-operative PP appears promising in high-risk patients. Controlled multicenter trials are warranted to delineate the optimal preventative and therapeutic approaches.

Conclusions
The incidence of recurrence of nephrotic syndrome/focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (NS/FSGS) has remained at ~30% for the past four decades, despite the introduction of newer and more potent immunosuppressive regimens. Multiple risk factors have been identified to predispose or precipitate clinical recurrence. However, no prospective multicenter studies have validated the relationships. Mutations of the gene encoding for podocin may identify a population of patients with NS/FSGS who are at a lower risk for clinical recurrence. Because of the potential for an increased incidence of recurrence and/or graft loss, living donor (LD) grafts should be used with constraint. Graft survival rates in recipients with NS/FSGS are decreased. However, if a remission can be induced, the outlook for long-term graft survival is substantially improved.
Various therapeutic regimens, including pre-operative plasmapheresis (PP), high-dose cyclosporine, IV cyclosporine, and adjunctive cyclophosphamide, have proven to be effective. However, there have been no multicenter controlled studies to delineate the optimal therapeutic approach. Recent use of pre-operative and/or post-operative prophylactic PP to prevent the recurrence of NS/FSGS is exciting. Controlled trials are required to validate efficacy and delineate a precise preventative regimen.
