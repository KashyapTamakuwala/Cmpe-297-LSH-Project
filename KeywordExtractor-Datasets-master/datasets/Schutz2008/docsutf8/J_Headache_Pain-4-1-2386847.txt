]. The aim of the present study was therefore to investigate the cerebral hemodynamic effects of CGRP in patients with migraine outside of attack.

Patients and methods
Patients
13
]. The subjects were not allowed to take medication, coffee, tea, alcohol or tobacco for 12 h before the study, and they were not allowed to take a triptan 24 h or ergotamine 48 h before the study.
Exclusion criteria were as follows: use of any kind of daily medication including prophylactic headache therapy but excluding oral contraceptives; pregnancy or breastfeeding; excessive use of analgesics or alcohol; serious somatic or psychiatric disorders; ischaemic heart disease; a supine systemic blood pressure more than 160/90 or less than 110/75 mmHg at entry of study.
Patients were informed that they were free to withdraw at any time and all gave written informed consent. The study was approved by the local ethics committees of Copenhagen and Copenhagen County (KA 96054) and complied with the Declaration of Helsinki.

Design and procedure
14
15
]. Patients were randomly assigned by computer (Med. Stat®, version 2.12). Randomization and preparation of study drugs was done by medical staff, who were not involved in the study. Five patients started with placebo and seven with hαCGRP. This quota was chosen by the computer and not known before the study. The effectiveness of blinding was not estimated.

Results
During CGRP infusion, two volunteers experienced a substantial decrease in blood pressure (70/50 and 65/25, respectively) causing the infusion to be terminated ahead of time. Signs and symptoms were pallor, cold sweat, stomach ache, nausea and palpitation. The situation was restored after placing the volunteers in head-down tilt for 7 and 20 min, respectively. No rCBF and TCD measurements were taken during this time period, and therefore, results from these two volunteers were excluded from the calculations below.

 for cerebral arteries in vitro.
The blinding of the present study can be criticized. Signs (increased heart rate) and symptoms (facial flushing and feeling of warmth) during CGRP infusion made it difficult to keep the study completely blinded. However, the present design is the best one available, because no technique is available to disguise such symptoms.

]. There is thus no CGRP receptor (CLR plus RAMP1) on the endothelium. The present results with a dilation of MCA could indicate that the blood–brain barrier to CGRP in the MCA is less tight in man than in rats, possibly related to the large difference in size.

). The discrepancy may be due to random variation. Altered cerebrovascular reactivity in patients with migraine compared to controls is another possibility. The decrease of mean MABP from 88 to 77 mmHg observed in the present study could also be a factor if autoregulation was disturbed by CGRP.

], an increase in noradrenaline in plasma was observed after CGRP. We found in the present study a decrease in mean blood pressure and an increase in heart rate as would be expected after administration of a potent vasodilator such as CGRP.
