Motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death in the United States for people ages 3–33, and rollover crashes have a higher fatality rate than any other crash mode. At the request and under the sponsorship of Ford Motor Company, Autoliv conducted a series of dynamic rollover tests on Ford Explorer sport utility vehicles (SUV) during 1998 and 1999. Data from those tests were made available to the public and were analyzed in this study to investigate the magnitude of and the temporal relationship between roof deformation, lap–shoulder seat belt loads, and restrained anthropometric test dummy (ATD) neck loads.

) for far-side, passenger ATDs, and peak neck loads were predictive of probable spinal column injury. The production lap and shoulder seat belts in the SUVs, which restrained both driver and passenger ATDs, consistently allowed ATD head contact with the roof while the roof was contacting the ground during this 1000 ms test series. Local peak neck forces and moments were noted each time the far-side, passenger ATD head contacted (“dived into”) the roof while the roof was in contact with the ground; however, the magnitude of these local peaks was only 2–13% of peak neck loads in all three tests. “Diving-type” neck loads were not predictive of injury for either driver or passenger ATD in any of the three tests.

 Closely related to this principle, DeHaven stated that “the packaging structures which shield the inner container must not be made of brittle or frail materials; they should resist force by yielding and absorbing energy applied to the outer container so as to cushion and distribute impact forces and thereby protect the inner container.”

 These tests were conducted using a standardized test methodology specified by Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) 208 of the U.S. Department of Transportation (FMVSS 208 49 CFR Ch. V (10-01-04 Edition)). These data provide the first opportunity to analyze the dynamics of belted occupants within a contemporary SUV in a standardized rollover test environment.
The authors used the described data in the present study. The study’s objective was to investigate both the magnitude of and the temporal relationship between dynamic roof deformation, lap–shoulder seat belt loads, and restrained ATD neck loads in these FMVSS 208 dolly rollover tests of Ford Explorer SUVs.

 according to the standardized FMVSS 208 test protocol. This standard, issued by the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (NHTSA) in 1971, outlines vehicle crash performance requirements designed for improving occupant protection. Described within FMVSS 208 is a voluntary, dolly rollover test used to evaluate occupant protection during a lateral rollover. This standardized test procedure was used for all three SUV rollover tests.

Data Analysis
® 
(registered trademark of The Mathworks, Inc.). Roof rail accelerations were transformed by subtracting the center of gravity accelerations from each measurement as a function of time. The result of the transformations was the acceleration of the roof rail relative to the vehicle’s center of gravity. The transformed roof rail acceleration values provided insight into when and in what direction the rail was moving. Transformed data was then compared to the ATD neck and seat belt loads as a function of time. The accelerations recorded by the rail sensors were influenced by both vehicle rotation (angular velocity) and localized pillar deformation. The contribution due to vehicle rotation was made at a low frequency given that the peak roll rate of the vehicle at any time during the test interval (0–1000 ms) was approximately 350–400°/s (i.e., less than 2 Hz). Thus, all higher frequency accelerations were necessarily due to localized structural deformation.
Vertical and/or lateral rail acceleration peak(s) “downward” and/or inboard toward the restrained ATD

, ear-to-shoulder lateral bending) were compared to the high-speed video data to validate the correlation in time between the presence of objective roof crush and the development of peak ATD neck and seat belt loads.


Results
Results are presented and discussed for the first full second of the roll sequence for each of the three SUV tests, which includes the initial driver-side-to-ground contact and full roof contact, followed by the first passenger-side-to-ground contact.
In all three tests, the external high-speed cameras recorded continuous roof-to-ground contact from the first contact of the driver’s roof rail with the ground until the end of the 1000 ms period, which corresponded to approximately 5/8 roll. Onboard high speed video cameras recorded the front passenger compartment of each SUV, capturing the kinematics of the ATDs as well as the deformation of the roof header and side roof rails during the rollover event. These cameras recorded inboard displacement of roof rails (“observable” roof crush) of both driver and passenger-side roof rails during the respective roof rail-to-ground contact for all three tests. The onboard clock, which was recorded by the interior cameras, allowed for a time-synchronized comparison of this data to the sensor output of the ATD neck transducers and roof rail accelerometers.

Discussion
The three rollover tests of 1998–1999 Ford Explorer SUVs analyzed in the present study represent a unique dataset evaluating occupant dynamics in rollover crashes as represented by Hybrid III ATDs. To the authors’ knowledge, this study represents the first published test series of full-scale rollover crashes of a contemporary SUV with time synchronized sensor output from ATD neck transducers, roof rail accelerometers, an onboard high speed clock, and high speed external and internal video cameras.

 These data provide a quantitative comparison of the significant differences between the input loads measured at the cadaver head versus what might be more appropriately referred to as the residual force magnitude that is recorded at the base of the cervical spine segment. No experimental cadaver work has measured and/or estimated the input loads at the superior aspect of the human neck, which is the site of the upper neck load cell in the Hybrid III dummy, when the head is subjected to an axial impact on the crown of the head. Additional research in this area is needed.

 readings from the lower neck sensor. In reality, the true axial compressive failure load of the human cervical spine is likely slightly lower than that measured by the head input loads in cadaver tests (due to inertial effects of the cadaver head), yet substantially greater than the lower cervical spine force data reported in the same cadaver tests. Thus, the real world relevance of threshold values used for both PII and “probable column injury” as a predictor of human injury risk must be tempered, consistent with the known biofidelity limitations of the ATD neck (described previously) and the wide variation in injury tolerance of the human spine, as described below.

 The degree of pre-flexion of the ATD necks prior to head-to-roof contact in the present study was not determined because the onboard cameras were positioned behind the ATDs during the rollover tests. The seat belt load cells (i.e., excluding the two sensors described previously that malfunctioned) recorded continuous tensile loads in both lap and shoulder belts throughout the test interval for both driver and passenger ATDs in all three tests. This belt load data indicated that the lap–shoulder belts locked and remained locked during the first 1000 ms test interval for all ATDs in all three tests.

 In contrast, Peak neck loads for the near-side, driver ATD occurred up to 65 ms following the time of occurrence of objective roof crush for all three tests. The onboard cameras also revealed observable roof crush into the far-side versus the near-side occupant compartment during the time of the peak neck loads, which was completely consistent with the timing and higher neck load magnitudes of the passenger, compared to driver, ATD for all three tests.

). Appendix 1 examines this issue and computes the probability for each pair of test metrics. This analysis revealed that there is a 93.1–98.6% probability that the differences in time occurrence of Peak neck loads between these results are NOT due to random chance alone. Stated more simply, there is a less than 7% probability that these differences are coincidental.

 The flexion moments recorded by the passenger ATD lower neck sensors in tests B180220 and B190043 exceeded the threshold values for probable spinal column injury by 40–240%. Thus, the results of this rollover test series suggest that the FMVSS 208 dolly rollover test may be a valid predictor of serious spinal injuries to restrained occupants in real-world rollovers.
The results of this study provide a unique data set that furthers understanding of probable spinal column injury mechanisms within a rollover crash environment. Such information may assist the scientific community and automotive engineers in recommending and designing appropriate intervention strategies to mitigate morbidity and mortality in rollover crashes. Moreover, these data may inform government agencies in formulating appropriate public safety policy to improve rollover crash protection for restrained occupants.

) for far-side, passenger ATDs, and Peak neck loads were predictive of probable spinal column injury. The production lap and shoulder seat belts in the SUVs, which restrained both driver and passenger ATDs, consistently allowed ATD head contact with the roof while the roof was contacting the ground during this 1000 ms test series. Local peak neck forces and moments were noted each time the far-side, passenger ATD head contacted (“dived into”) the roof while the roof was in contact with the ground; however, the magnitude of these local maxima was only 2–13% of Peak neck loads in all three tests. “Diving-type” neck loads were not predictive of spinal column injury for either driver or passenger ATD in any of the three tests. When viewed from a vehicle-based, occupant protection frame of reference, the existing FMVSS 208 dynamic rollover test is a repeatable, reliable, and valid test method to evaluate the risk of probable spinal column injury in rollover crash environments.
