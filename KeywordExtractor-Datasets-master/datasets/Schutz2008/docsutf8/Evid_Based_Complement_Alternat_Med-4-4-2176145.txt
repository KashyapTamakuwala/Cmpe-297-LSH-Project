Yoga, a form of physical activity, is rapidly gaining in popularity and has many health benefits. Yet healthcare providers have been slow to recognize yoga for its ability to improve health conditions, and few interventions have been developed that take full advantage of its benefits. The purpose of this article is to review published studies using yoga programs and to determine the effect of yoga interventions on common risk factors of chronic diseases (overweight, hypertension, high glucose level and high cholesterol). A systematic search yielded 32 articles published between 1980 and April 2007. The studies found that yoga interventions are generally effective in reducing body weight, blood pressure, glucose level and high cholesterol, but only a few studies examined long-term adherence. Additionally, not enough studies included diverse populations at high risk for diabetes and its related common health problems.

, identified 56 research articles. After the author had read the full text of the 56 articles and identified those that met the purpose of the study, 24 articles were excluded, mainly because they described outcome variables and characteristics of yoga that were irrelevant. Poor quality was not a reason for exclusion, but studies were excluded if they focused only on meditation or relaxation (Pranayama) or if they were case studies. This process resulted in a final total of 32 articles to be reviewed.

Discussion
Fig. 1
Figure 1.
The possible effects of yoga on behavioral, psychological and physiological measures are illustrated. This article focuses on current evidences for physiological changes.




Of the articles describing interventions, only a few provided details regarding the yoga programs or the names and sequence of yoga postures. Asana and Pranayama provide different types of health benefits, and therapeutic yoga programs can involve various combinations of these two components. An optimal comparison of study results thus requires knowing the combination of Asana and Pranayama used. The sequence of yoga postures can be inferred from the list of posture names, but more straightforward information is essential to future studies seeking to replicate or generalize the results. A related issue that remains to be resolved is how to standardize yoga exercises for research purposes.
The optimal duration and intensity required to maximize the effectiveness of yoga need to be determined, as does the need for a booster to provide long-term effects. Because the MET of yoga is low, increasing the frequency may increase the benefits. However, these factors cannot be judged from the reviews studies; many articles did not clearly identify the dosage of the yoga program studied, and they focused on the short-term health benefits of yoga. Only a few studies included follow-up data beyond 6 months. It also remains to be determined whether more intensive training, that is, a greater dosage, improves the likelihood of adopting and maintaining active behavior in the long run.

). Therefore, it is important to consider participants’ health conditions because there are possible differences in the effects of yoga by their health severity.

Conclusions
Analyses of yoga intervention should be designed and conducted to identify programs best suited for diverse populations and for specific populations with high-risk factors for chronic health conditions. Such studies could guide the development of more practical and effective interventions.
