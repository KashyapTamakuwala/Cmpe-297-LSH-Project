Escherichia coli
 (EPEC) triggers a large release of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) from host intestinal cells and the extracellular ATP is broken down to adenosine diphosphate (ADP), AMP, and adenosine. Adenosine is a potent secretagogue in the small and large intestine. We suspected that ecto-5′-nucleotidase (CD73, an intestinal enzyme) was a critical enzyme involved in the conversion of AMP to adenosine and in the pathogenesis of EPEC diarrhea. We developed a nonradioactive method for measuring ecto-5′-nucleotidase in cultured T84 cell monolayers based on the detection of phosphate release from 5′-AMP. EPEC infection triggered a release of ecto-5′-nucleotidase from the cell surface into the supernatant medium. EPEC-induced 5′-nucleotidase release was not correlated with host cell death but instead with activation of phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC). Ecto-5′-nucleotidase was susceptible to inhibition by zinc acetate and by α,β-methylene-adenosine diphosphate (α,β-methylene-ADP). In the Ussing chamber, these inhibitors could reverse the chloride secretory responses triggered by 5′-AMP. In addition, α,β-methylene-ADP and zinc blocked the ability of 5′-AMP to stimulate EPEC growth under nutrient-limited conditions in vitro. Ecto-5′-nucleotidase appears to be the major enzyme responsible for generation of adenosine from adenine nucleotides in the T84 cell line, and inhibitors of ecto-5′-nucleotidase, such as α,β-methylene-ADP and zinc, might be useful for treatment of the watery diarrhea produced by EPEC infection.

]. Extracellular ATP is broken down to ADP, AMP, and then adenosine, where it triggers a vigorous fluid secretory response in intestinal epithelium. We suspected that ecto-5′-nucleotidase also played a role in the diarrheal fluid secretion induced by EPEC and initiated this study to determine if it is the case, and, if so, whether inhibitors of ecto-5′-nucleotidase could block fluid secretion triggered by adenine nucleotides and EPEC infection. We used the T84 colon carcinoma cell line as a model because we have used these cells to study EPEC infection, they express ecto-5′-nucleotidase, and they can be studied in the Ussing chamber to measure chloride secretion. In order to facilitate our study we also developed a nonradioactive, non-high-pressure liquid chromatography (non-HPLC) method for measuring ecto-5′-nucleotidase in living T84 cell monolayers.

 incubator. During pipetting the multiwell plate was kept warm using a metal heating block set at 37°, and a stopwatch was used to time the AMP addition and to terminate the assay. The procedure used for measuring monolayer activity was slightly different from that used to measure 5′-nucleotidase activity released into the supernatant, as described below.
Cell-bound or monolayer activity
 To measure cell-bound ecto-5′-nucleotidase activity in cell monolayers, 5′-AMP was added to yield a final concentration of 0.2 mM to quadruplicate wells. Two other wells were left without addition of AMP (the “no AMP blank”). After a 10-min incubation at 37° an aliquot (usually 50 μl) was removed and quickly transferred to a well of a 96-well plate to terminate the reaction.

PCR was performed using a two-step protocol with an annealing temperature of 58.7° and denaturation at 95° for 30 s each (i.e, no extension step) for 35 cycles. Thermal melt curve analysis was performed at the end of the PCR amplification and showed a single sharp peak for the genes analyzed.

The origin of this faint band is unknown, but it is possible it is generated by proteolysis rather than PI-PLC activation. For example, E2348/69 expresses EspC, an autotransporter protease whose export is independent of type III secretion.

]. EPEC behaves clinically as a noninvasive pathogen and does not trigger an influx of fecal leukocytes, but nevertheless triggers ATP release from the host. Therefore our results suggest that ecto-5′-nucleotidase plays a role in the response to a broader range of pathogens, including noninvasive enteric pathogens, than was previously thought.

]. Researchers have speculated that secreted microbial nucleotidases may serve in protection against killing by host immune cells, acquisition of nutrients from the host, or dampening of host immune responses. EPEC does not appear to secrete nucleotidase activity under any conditions we have encountered, but may achieve the same goal by triggering the release of 5′-nucleotidase from the host cell.

 seem to indicate that to sustain a secretory response there must be on ongoing production of adenosine from AMP. In other words, there seems to be a “sink” for depletion of adenosine from the extracellular medium, either by cellular reuptake or by adenosine deaminase. The rapid turnover of adenosine implied in these experiments suggested that inhibitors of ecto-5′-nucleotidase might be able to block EPEC-induced fluid secretion in animal models of infection.

); since this is a direct effect on bacterial cells this action of zinc would not depend on the nutritional status of the host. The effects of zinc on EPEC infection and on diarrheal diseases in non-zinc-deficient children deserve further study.
