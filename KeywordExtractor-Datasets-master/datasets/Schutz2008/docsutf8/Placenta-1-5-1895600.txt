Abstract
Placental oxidative stress has been implicated in many complications of human pregnancy, including preterm delivery and preeclampsia. It is now appreciated that reactive oxygen species can induce a spectrum of changes, ranging from homeostatic induction of enzymes to apoptotic cell death. Little is known regarding the occurrence of placental oxidative stress in other species. We investigated markers of oxidative stress in the labyrinthine (LZ) and junctional (JZ) zones of the murine placenta across gestational age, and correlated these with expression of the cyclooxygenase enzymes COX-1 and COX-2, and apoptosis. We tested a causal link between the two by subjecting placental explants to hypoxia-reoxygenation (H/R) in vitro, a known stimulus for generation of oxidative stress. Western blotting demonstrated significant increases in the concentrations of hydroxynonenal (HNE), COX-1 and COX-2 with gestational age. Dual-labelling demonstrated co-localisation of HNE, and COX-1 and COX-2 within the trophoblast of the LZ, and glycogen cells of the JZ. An apoptotic index based on TUNEL-positivity demonstrated an increase with gestational age, and dual-labelling showed co-localisation of TUNEL labelling with HNE and active caspase-3 within the trophoblast of the LZ. H/R significantly increased oxidative stress, induction of COX-1 and COX-2, and the apoptotic index. Co-localisation demonstrated the increases in COX to be within the trophoblast of the LZ, and in particular the glycogen cells of the JZ. Apoptosis was restricted to the LZ. We speculate that the induction of COX enzymes is a physiological response to oxidative stress, and may play a role in initiating or augmenting parturition. Generation of oxidative stress may also play a role in influencing the growth trajectory of the placenta, and its component cell types. The mouse may provide an experimental genetic model in which to investigate these phenomena.

. There are fundamental similarities in the changes occurring prior to labour, including an increase in myometrial contractile activity, increased coupling of myometrial cells through the formation of gap junctions, an increase in PG receptors in the myometrium, and enhanced sensitivity to oxytocin at term. There is also a rise in intracellular calcium resulting in an increase in myosin light chain phosphorylation.
In this study we determined the degree of oxidative stress present in the murine placenta at different gestational ages in normal pregnancies. We also tested whether there was a temporal and spatial association between oxidative stress and two markers of placental function, one physiological and one pathological. These were the induction of cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes and apoptosis respectively.

Materials and methods
2.1
Tissue collection
Placentas were collected from C57BL/6J inbred mice, and all experiments were carried out in accordance with the UK Government Home Office licensing procedures. Stages E14, E16, E18, and E19 were studied, where E1 of gestation was the morning when a copulation plug was found.

Western blotting

) at 4 °C overnight. After washes in TBS-T, membranes were incubated with the horseradish peroxidase secondary antibody at room temperature for 1 h. The immunoreactive bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence with the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer instructions. The levels of protein expression were quantified densitometrically and normalised against their respective expressions of β-actin. Prestained protein markers were used as molecular weight standards for each analysis.

Immunohistochemistry

), diluted in goat serum, were applied overnight in a humidified chamber at 4 °C. Binding was detected using Vectastain Elite ABC kits (Vector Laboratories) and SigmaFast DAB (Sigma), according to the manufacturers’ instructions. Sections were then lightly counterstained with haematoxylin. Negative controls were performed by omitting incubation with the primary antibody. For each antibody slides from all the gestational ages were prepared and immunostained in the same batch, ensuring identical conditions for comparisons.
In order to localise expression of the antigens to specific cell types staining intensity was graded visually from 0–3, where 0 represented the negative control. Three people scored the sections independently, blinded to the gestational age or experimental protocol, and the mean value was taken.

2.4
Immunofluorescent dual-labelling
Dual immunofluorescent labelling was performed in order to test for co-localisation of markers of oxidative stress and COX expression in individual cells. Sections were dewaxed, permeabilised in TBS containing Triton X-100 (0.1%) and Tween 20 (0.1%) (TBS-TT) for 30–60 min, and blocked in 5% bovine serum albumin for 20 min at room temperature. Primary antibodies diluted in TBS-TT were applied overnight at 4 °C. Negative control sections had primary antibodies omitted. After three 10-min washes in TBS-TT, sections were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with a mixture of fluorescent secondary antibodies, containing anti-goat Alexa 488 and anti-rabbit Alexa 568 (both used 1/100; from Molecular Probes) in TBS-TT. Sections were washed in TBS-TT as before and then twice in distilled water for 5 min and subsequently mounted in Vectashield mounting medium containing DAPI (Vector, UK). Images were captured using a Leica confocal microscope (LeicaTCS-NT, Leica Instruments GmbH).
Co-localisation was identified in overlay images by a yellow signal caused by the combination of the green signal (COX-1/COX-2) and the red signal (HNE).

Dual-fluorescence TUNEL assay & Active Caspase-3, and HNE co-localisation
Staining was performed using In-Situ Cell Death Detection kit-Texas Red (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and using an Anti-Active Caspase-3 antibody (Promega) at 1:50, and Anti-HNE as previously at 1:200. Samples were also DAPI stained to intercalate the DNA and fluoresce cell nuclei. For negative controls, omission of primary antibody and TdT enzyme were performed separately. For positive controls, post-lactational mouse mammary glands were used. For confocal microscopy, all samples were analysed during one session to avoid bias, and multiple (usually 5) fields of view per labyrinth were saved for further analysis.

Control samples were cultured for 4 h in normoxia, whereas samples subjected to H/R experienced 1 h of hypoxia followed by 3 h of normoxia. Following culture the tissues were either frozen or fixed for Western blotting and immunohistochemistry respectively.

f), and this was maintained at 2.5 at E19. The spongiotrophoblast cells were less immunoreactive, scoring only 0.5 throughout gestation, and no immunoreactivity was observed in the giant cells or the decidua.
Nitrotyrosine (NT) staining indicates the formation of the prooxidant peroxynitrite, and of an imbalance in the production of the superoxide ions and nitric oxide. Immunostaining revealed a similar pattern to HNE, with almost undetectable staining in early samples and significant increases from day 16 onwards (data not shown).
Therefore, oxidative stress increases during gestation in the murine placenta, specifically in syncytiotrophoblast and glycogen cells.

c). There was occasional evidence of apoptotic body formation, but other classical characteristics, such as plasma membrane blebbing, could not be resolved with light microscopy. The position of the nuclei suggested that the majority was within the syncytiotrophoblast, but the involvement of cytotrophoblast and endothelial cells could not be excluded at the light microscopic level.

d). From resin-embedded material it appeared that most of the cells with condensed peripheral chromatin following H/R were within the syncytiotrophoblast layers (data not shown).
From these data it can be concluded that there is a significant increase in oxidative stress following H/R, and that this is associated with increased expression of COX-1 and COX-2 expression in the LZ and JZ, and with increased apoptosis in the labyrinth.

Discussion
These results indicate that oxidative stress increases with gestational age in the murine placenta during normal pregnancies, and that it may play a significant physiological role by inducing higher concentrations of the COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes, and hence increasing prostaglandin synthesis. Our data also indicate a close temporal and spatial association between oxidative stress and trophoblast apoptosis within the labyrinth. Trophoblast apoptosis has been linked to the pathophysiology of preeclampsia, and the mouse might provide a useful genetic model in which to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the shedding of apoptotic debris.
[3,25]
, and its development in the murine placenta towards term is consistent with this view. As fetal and placental oxygen extraction reach their peaks so any transient mismatch between maternal oxygen supply and feto-placental demand will lead to a dip in the intraplacental oxygen concentration. The fact that H/R in vitro is a powerful inducer of oxidative stress, and that the stress localises to the same tissues as in late gestation supports this hypothesis. It is now accepted that oxidative stress induces a spectrum of cellular changes, ranging from the physiologically homeostatic to the frankly pathologic. Induction of enzymes is towards the more physiological end of that spectrum, whereas apoptosis is towards the opposite extreme.
[26–30]
[31]
, so reducing their contribution to the overall tissue homogenate.
[32]
[10,11,33]
 this raises the possibility that placental oxidative stress could play a role in initiating or augmenting uterine contractions should the mismatch in maternal blood supply and feto-placental demands become extreme.
[24]
[34]
[20]
. The mitochondrial pathway was strongly implicated in the apoptotic process in the human, but further work is required to determine whether the same mechanism operates in the mouse.
[35]
. The fetal endothelial cells did not display immunoreactivity for HNE or nitrotyrosine, and did not appear to label with TUNEL, suggesting that oxidative stress and its consequences are lower in this cell type.
[36]
[37–39]
[6]
. Whether apoptotic debris is shed from the murine labyrinth as in the human placenta towards the end of gestation remains to be determined.
