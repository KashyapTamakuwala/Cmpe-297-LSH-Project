 In vitro calcification of VSMCs is not affected by amlodipine, but is stimulated by atorvastatin at concentrations ≥10 μmol/l, which could contribute to the plaque-stabilizing effect reported for statins.

]. Combination therapy with CA and statin was shown to improve endothelial function and arterial compliance, to diminish LDL atherogenicity, and to slow the progression of atherosclerosis. So far, the effects of the combination therapy with CA and statin on vascular calcification have not been studied extensively.
We used an in vitro model of vascular calcification by neonatal rat VSMCs, isolated by outgrowth from aortic explants. The purpose of this investigation was to identify the factors, and their concentrations, that are mandatory to induce calcification of aortic VSMCs in vitro. Since calcium is such a major component of advanced atherosclerotic lesions, we furthermore studied whether the CA amlodipine and the statin atorvastatin, alone and in combination, affected calcification of aortic VSMCs in vitro.

Materials and methods
Cell culture
Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) were obtained from segments of aortas explanted from 2-day old Wistar rats. Aortic segments were obtained aseptically and cut open longitudinally. The endothelium was removed by gently rubbing the luminal side of the aortas over the surface of a tissue culture dish (Falcon). Subsequently, the aortas were placed, lumen side down, on the bottom of a tissue culture flask (Greiner), and allowed to adhere for approximately 3 h. Then tissues were immersed in growth medium consisting of Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) (Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Life Technologies), penicillin (100 U/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) (both supplied by BioWhittaker Europe). Seven days later the aortic tissues were removed, and the VSMCs that had grown out were detached by trypsinization. The detached cells were resuspended in growth medium and seeded in tissue culture flasks (Greiner), 6 or 12-well plates or on glass cover slips.

Immunocytochemistry
Subconfluent cultures at early passage were examined for the presence of α-smooth muscle actin, SM myosin heavy chain and calponin using specific antibodies (anti-SM actin clone 1A4 (1:400), Sigma; anti-SM myosin heavy chain (1:100), SanverTech; anti-calponin (1:10,000), Sigma). After fixation in 1% formalin in PBS on ice for 30 min, cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 30 min, and subsequently incubated with the primary antibody for several hours at 4°C. Secondary antibodies were conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) or Cy3 (Sigma). To identify cell nuclei, the cells were also stained with Hoechst 33342 (10 μg/ml; Molecular Probes). Immunofluorescent images were obtained using a fluorescence microscope (Nikon Eclipse) equipped with 20×, 40×, and 100× objectives and a digital camera (Nikon DXM1200).

, ascorbic acid, β-glycerophosphate, and dexamethasone were varied.
In another series of experiments, calcification medium was supplemented with amlodipine (0.01–1 μmol/l), atorvastatin (2–50 μmol/l), or a combination of these drugs. The CA amlodipine was dissolved in absolute ethanol at a concentration of 1 mmol/l. This stock solution was to be diluted at least 1:1,000 in culture medium. Atorvastatin, an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, was dissolved in absolute ethanol at a concentration of 10 mmol/l. This stock solution was to be diluted at least 1:200 in culture medium.
Cells treated with calcification medium without added drugs were used as controls. Appropriate amounts of solvent (ethanol) were added to these controls. Addition of ethanol at these levels did not affect cell growth. After 3 weeks of incubation, calcification was quantified.

Assessment of calcium deposition

Subsequently, the standard culture medium (DMEM, 10% FBS, antibiotics) was replaced by calcification medium supplemented with amlodipine, atorvastatin, or a combination of both. Cell proliferation was assessed at day 4 and day 9 using the Cell Proliferation Kit II (XTT, Roche), which is a colorimetric assay for the non-radioactive quantification of cell proliferation and viability.

Detection of apoptosis
To identify apoptotic cells by assessment of condensation of nuclear chromatin, VSMC cultures were stained with Hoechst 33342 (10 μg/ml; Molecular Probes) for 10 min in the dark. Immunofluorescent images were obtained using a fluorescence microscope (Nikon Eclipse) equipped with 20x, 40x, and 100x objectives and a digital camera (Nikon DXM1200). In 6 frames per treatment, an average of 250 nuclei per frame were assessed for the presence of apoptosis.

The present study also showed that β-glycerophosphate is crucial for the induction of calcification in rat aortic VSMCs. Ascorbic acid augments this process. Dexamethasone was demonstrated to be less vital in this model of aortic VSMC calcification.

] presented the concept “that calcium is not a critical substrate for plaque disruption and is, in fact, associated with more stable plaques.” Therefore, statin-induced alterations in the plaque’s composition from lipid to fibrous tissue without or with calcification would decrease the plaque’s vulnerability to rupture, thereby decreasing the risk of acute coronary syndromes.
38
]. Since atherosclerotic plaque composition plays an important role in plaque stability, with lipids destabilizing the plaque and calcification stabilizing the plaque, the effect of statins on plaque composition may be favorable. In addition to lipid-lowering and calcification-inducing effects, we observed that statins have an anti-proliferative effect on VSMCs. Less proliferation of VSMCs may destabilize the plaque. However, this only occurred at high doses of atorvastatin, whereas calcification induction occurred at lower dose of atorvastatin.

], the present study found no difference between the combination of amlodipine and atorvastatin therapy, and atorvastatin therapy alone on VSMC calcification.
2
 concentrations are important determinants of in vitro calcification of rat aortic VSMCs. Ascorbic acid stimulates this process. Dexamethasone was demonstrated to be less vital in this model of VSMC calcification. In vitro calcification of rat aortic VSMCs is not affected by amlodipine treatment, but is stimulated by atorvastatin treatment. As high concentrations of atorvastatin have a pro-apoptotic effect, the pro-calcification effect of atorvastatin may be explained by the production of apoptotic bodies that act as foci for calcium deposition. The latter finding may explain the plaque-stabilizing effect reported for statins.
