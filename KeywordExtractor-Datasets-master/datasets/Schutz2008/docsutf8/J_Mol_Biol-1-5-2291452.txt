Abstract
Two homologous fibronectin type III (fnIII) domains, FNfn10 (the
                    10th fnIII domain of human fibronectin) and TNfn3 (the third fnIII domain of
                    human tenascin), have essentially the same backbone structure, although they
                    share only ∼ 24% sequence identity. While they share a similar
                    folding mechanism with a common core of key residues in the folding transition
                    state, they differ in many other physical properties. We use a chimeric protein,
                    FNoTNc, to investigate the molecular basis for these differences. FNoTNc is a
                    core-swapped protein, containing the “outside” (surface and loops) of FNfn10 and
                    the hydrophobic core of TNfn3. Remarkably, FNoTNc retains the structure of the
                    parent proteins despite the extent of redesign, allowing us to gain insight into
                    which components of each parent protein are responsible for different aspects of
                    its behaviour. Naively, one would expect properties that appear to depend
                    principally on the core to be similar to TNfn3, for example, the response to
                    mutations, folding kinetics and side-chain dynamics, while properties apparently
                    determined by differences in the surface and loops, such as backbone dynamics,
                    would be more like FNfn10. While this is broadly true, it is clear that there
                    are also unexpected crosstalk effects between the core and the surface. For
                    example, the anomalous response of FNfn10 to mutation is not solely a property
                    of the core as we had previously suggested.

 In this study, rather than seeking to understand what related
                    proteins have in common, we ask a different question—can differences between
                    closely related proteins be explained?

 Why do proteins that are structurally almost identical behave
                    so differently? Which components of a protein are responsible for the various
                    aspects of its behaviour? How independent are the properties of the surface and
                    hydrophobic core? We have addressed these questions by making a chimera of these
                    two fnIII domains.

                    results suggest, however, that the surface and loops can play a key (and
                    sometimes unexpected) role in determining the biophysical properties of a
                    protein.

. The hydrogen
                            exchange behaviour of FNoTNc clearly resembles that of FNfn10: both have
                            many residues that exchange in the experimental dead time, in particular
                            in the edge strands (A, C′, E and G strands) that are more protected in
                            TNfn3. Note that this does not result from differences in the intrinsic
                            stabilities of the domains—TNfn3 is significantly less stable than
                            either FNoTNc or FNfn10 under these experimental conditions.

. Within the core of FNoTNc is a cluster of deeply
                            buried residues, which have unusually low order parameters, as has
                            previously been observed in TNfn3.



Discussion
The core of FNoTNc is similar to that of TNfn3, but apparently less closely
                    packed.

c). The anomalous response to
                            mutation in this peripheral region of the core of FNoTNc and FNfn10 is
                            intriguing: apparently the “plastic” response of the protein to mutation
                            of these three buried residues is modulated by the surface of the
                            protein and is not determined by the core alone. The additional
                            plasticity at this end of the hydrophobic core may be due to its
                            proximity to the longer FG loop in FNfn10 and FNoTNc, which restricts
                            motion less than the corresponding loop in TNfn3.

                            Again surprisingly, local instability appears to be a function of the
                            surface of the protein and not a property of the core; however, the
                            plasticity inferred from response to mutation and local instability
                            still appear to be related, as was previously inferred. This is not,
                            however, related to slow exchange motions of the backbone, as we had
                            previously suggested, since the millisecond time scale motions observed
                            in the A/B region of FNfn10 are not found in FNoTNc.


The stability of FNoTNc is modulated by both the core and the
                        surface

                        7

 Interestingly, however, the “local stability” of the
                        peripheral regions of FNoTNc is lower than the local stability of TNfn3, as
                        manifested in the hydrogen exchange experiments. The surface residues of
                        FNfn10 are modulating the stability of these peripheral regions.

 investigated the stability and dynamics of a series of
                        loop-swap mutants of FNfn10 and TNfn3: essentially these were mutants where
                        the C–C′ and F–G loops were exchanged. Interestingly, both TNfn3 domains had
                        lower thermal stabilities than the wild-type protein, whereas the thermal
                        stability of FNfn10 was unaffected by the exchange. We infer that in our
                        chimeric protein, interactions of the surface residues are most important in
                        the increase in stabilisation of FNoTNc beyond that of TNfn3, and not the
                        new C–C′ and F–G loops.

 Neither FNoTNc nor TNfn3 show any evidence for
                            population of a folding intermediate—the presence of a stable folding
                            intermediate in FNfn10 appears to be the result of core interactions.
30,40,41

42

 Both FNfn10 and some mutants of FNoTNc display curvature
                            in the unfolding arm that is not seen in wild-type TNfn3. It should be
                            noted, however, that unfolding curvature has been seen in a less stable
                            form of TNfn3 (missing the final two C-terminal residues) and may simply
                            not be observed in this case because the unfolding arm in the stable
                            form of TNfn3 used here is relatively short. In summary, FNoTNc has
                            similar folding characteristics to TNfn3. This suggests that the core of
                            these proteins plays the major role in determining the folding
                            behaviour.

                            Thus, the stabilising surface interactions apparently stabilise the
                            transition state of FNoTNc as much as the native state, while still not
                            causing a folding intermediate to be populated. This, perhaps, allows us
                            to pinpoint further which surface interactions are responsible for the
                            added stability of FNoTNc (over TNfn3). At the transition state, the
                            loops and the peripheral A and G strands are largely unstructured, but
                            there is structure in the B, C, C′, E and F strands, particularly
                            towards the centre of the core (see Φ value section below). Interactions
                            between surface residues in these strands are therefore the most likely
                            candidates for providing additional stability to the FNoTNc protein
                            (both native and transition states), above those interactions between
                            residues that are packing in the core.

                            TNfn3. The pattern of Φ values is very similar to that of TNfn3,
                            although there are slight qualitative differences. Again, the highest Φ
                            values are found in the B, C, C′, E and Φ strands and the Φ values in
                            the A and G strands are ∼ 0. The folding mechanism of
                            FNoTNc is unperturbed and the same as both the parents, although from
                            the magnitude and extent of the residues with higher Φ values the
                            transition-state structure appears to be closer to that of TNfn3 than
                            FNfn10.


Dynamics from NMR is determined by local interactions
Side-chain dynamics
The side-chain dynamics appear to reflect core packing, as was
                            discussed above, and so FNoTNc resembles TNfn3 more closely than
                        FNfn10.

 values when the loops are
                            swapped than we see in FNoTNc compared to the parent proteins. However,
                            there is a general agreement that the behaviour of the loops is a local
                            property, rather than being a direct effect of either core or surface
                            interactions.



Conclusion
We have grafted the core of one fnIII domain (TNfn3) into the homologue
                    FNfn10, creating a chimera, FNoTNc, which has retained the structure of the
                    parent proteins. Using several different probes, we have shown that FNoTNc does
                    not behave like either one of the parent proteins alone. Instead, it has
                    retained a number of properties of each. We find that each property investigated
                    clearly resembles the behaviour of one of the parents, enabling us to separate
                    the contribution of the core and the surface of the protein in determining the
                    behaviour of the domain. Some of these are unsurprising, such as the pH
                    dependence of stability, the core side-chain dynamics and the dependence of
                    folding on the composition of the core. However, the surface of the protein
                    confers significant stability not only on the native state, but also on the
                    transition state for folding. Others properties are less predictable. The
                    surface of the protein confers “plasticity” in peripheral regions of the
                    proteins as detected by the anomalous response of some regions of the core to
                    mutation and hydrogen exchange protection patterns.
This suggests that the surface of a domain may have a more significant
                    coupling with the core than we had previously considered. Since most biophysical
                    studies tend to focus on the core of a protein, this coupling is a relatively
                    unexplored area of research.

                        (< 0.25) are coloured red, medium Φ values
                        (0.25 < Φ > 0.35) are coloured magenta and high Φ values
                        (> 0.35) are coloured blue.

Numbering of proteins is the same between positions 1 and 78. There is
                    a four-residue insertion in the F–G loop of FNoTNc and FNfn10, resulting in the
                    numbering of equivalent residues in the G strand being four numbers lower in
                    TNfn3.
