Summary
To evaluate the incidence of new and/or progressive vertebral deformities and changes in bone mineral density, we re-examined 66 patients with sarcoidosis after a follow-up period of four years. In 17 subjects (26%) new and/or progressive vertebral deformities were found, though BMD did not change significantly.

Introduction
Previous studies from our group have shown that morphometric vertebral deformities suggestive of fractures can be found in 20% of patients with sarcoidosis, despite a normal bone mineral density (BMD). The aim of this study was to determine the incidence of new and/or progressive vertebral deformities and the evolution of BMD during the course of this disease.

Methods
BMD of the hip (DXA) and vertebral fracture assessment (VFA) with lateral single energy densitometry was performed at baseline and after 45 months in 66 patients with sarcoidosis. Potential predictors of new/progressive vertebral deformities were assessed using logistic regression analysis.

Results
The BMD of the total group was unchanged after follow-up. The prevalence of vertebral deformities increased from 20 to 32% ( < 0.05); in 17 subjects (26%) new or progressive vertebral deformities were diagnosed. A lower T-score of the femoral neck [(OR = 2.5 (CI: 1.0-5.9),  < 0.05)] and mother with a hip fracture [(OR = 14.1 (CI:1.4-142.6),  < 0.05)] were independent predictors of new/progressive deformities.

Conclusions
In subjects with sarcoidosis the number of vertebral deformities increases in the course of this disease, despite unchanged BMD. The combination of low normal BMD and family history of fragility fractures confers an increased risk of the incidence of these deformities.

If so, this may result in progressive vertebral deformities during the course of the disease. For this reason we re-examined individuals with sarcoidosis four years after the initial measurements to determine the incidence of new and/or progressive vertebral deformities and their relation with changes in BMD.

Laboratory assays
Serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D concentration was determined by radioimmuno-assay using a commercially available kit [(IDS Ltd, Boldon, England, interassay coefficient of variation (IE-CV) 18%, intra-assay CV (IA-CV) 15%)]. High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) was measured by particle-enhanced immunonephelometry on the BN Prospec (Dade Behring). The detection limit is 0.175 mg/L and the measuring range is 0.175–1100 mg/L. Soluble IL-2 receptor (sIL-2R) was determined on the IMMULITE automated analyzer, by means of a two-site chemiluminescent enzyme immunometric assay with a measuring range of 50–7500 kU/L (Diagnostic Product Corporation, Los Angeles, CA, cat no LKIP1). Serum angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) was measured using a colorimetric method. The precision of the ACE assay was < 5.6% and the reference interval for ACE was 9–25 U/L.

Bone mineral density and vertebral morphometry
Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured by dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA, Hologic QDR 4500). In 2002 only the BMD of the hip was measured. In 2006 the BMD of both the hip and of the lumbar spine were determined. As reference group for the hip the NHANES III database (sex- and age-matched) was used. A standard protocol as described previously was used for measurement of BMD. To adjust for age and gender, Z-scores were used. To examine changes in Z-scores between baseline and follow-up measurements a Δ Z-score was calculated reflecting the difference between the Z-score at follow-up and the Z-score at baseline.

Clinical fractures and vertebral deformities
Three new non-vertebral fractures occurred during the follow-up period. These included a hip fracture (twice in the same patient), an ankle fracture and a fracture of the thumb. All these fractures were related to trauma and occurred in subjects older than 50 years.

Comparing the groups with and without new or progressive vertebral deformities at follow-up, no differences in Δ Z-scores of BMD of the trochanter or femoral neck (FN) were found (Δ Z-score trochanter −0.02 ± 0.41 and 0.08 ± 0.38 respectively and Δ Z-score FN 0.01 ± 0.32 and 0.08 ± 0.35). In addition no differences in baseline Z-scores of ICTP and PINP were seen between these groups. Multivariable logistic regression analysis, including factors that correlated in the univariate analysis, revealed that a T-score of the femoral neck at baseline (OR per 1 SD T-score reduction = 2.5 (CI: 1.0–5.9),  = 0.04), and a mother with a hip fracture (OR = 14.1 (CI:1.4–142,6),  = 0.02) were determinants of a new and/or progressive morphometric vertebral deformity at follow-up measurement. Factors such as age, gender, calcium in take, GC use, daily GC dose, lifetime GC dose, disease activity, bone markers, radiographic stage and disease duration at baseline did not predict new and/or progressive vertebral deformities.

], which increased to 32% of all subjects in 2006. In parallel, the total number of deformities in these subjects almost doubled. However, BMD of the trochanter and femoral neck did not change over time and BMD of the lumbar spine at follow-up measurement did not differ from the reference population. These data are suggestive of an increased risk of progressive vertebral deformities in individuals with sarcoidosis despite preservation of BMD.

], which revealed an incidence of new deformities of 3.4% after a similar follow-up period. As the mean age of subjects included in this study was substantially higher than that of our cohort, these data cannot be used as a reference, although it is likely that in younger age groups even lower incident deformities would be observed. The high prevalence of vertebral deformities at baseline, the significant increase of more than 50% of subjects after follow-up with one or more deformity and the increase of severity of prevalent deformities all imply that sarcoidosis is a relevant risk factor for vertebral deformity.

Despite the on average normal BMD, we found T-score of the femoral neck and a family history of hip fractures to be predictors of a new and/or progressive vertebral deformity. This suggests that the combination of a lower BMD in combination with the increased bone turnover in sarcoidosis predisposes to progressive vertebral deformity. If so, this would mean that in these high risk individuals preventive treatment should be considered to reduce fracture risk. Controlled trials are needed, however, to substantiate this suggestion.

] and Scheuermann’s disease. We have, however, no indications that these relatively rare conditions may have interfered with our observations.
In conclusion, we have shown that in subjects with sarcoidosis the number of vertebral deformities, diagnosed with morphometric assessment, increases during the course of this disease despite preservation of BMD. Although this is an uncontrolled study, it appears that subjects with sarcoidosis have an increased fracture risk, even if BMD is normal. High risk individuals can be identified by a low-normal BMD and by a family history of hip fractures. Probably these individuals will benefit from therapies that increase bone strength. A T-score FN below −0.45 may be used to identify these individuals with a high sensitivity and an acceptable specificity. Studies evaluating the effects of such therapies in individuals with sarcoidosis are however clearly needed.
