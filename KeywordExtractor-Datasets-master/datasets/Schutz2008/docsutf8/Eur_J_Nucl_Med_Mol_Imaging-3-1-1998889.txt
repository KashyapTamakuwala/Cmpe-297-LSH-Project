Conclusion
FET PET is a sensitive tool for monitoring the effects of locoregional RIT. Homogeneous, slightly increasing FET uptake around the tumour cavity with a peak up to 18 months after RIT, followed by stable or decreasing uptake, points to benign, therapy-related changes. In contrast, nodular uptake is a reliable indicator of recurrence.

Materials and methods
Patients
Twenty-four patients (9 females, 15 males) with a mean age of 49±14 years and histopathologically proven tenascin expression of malignant gliomas (5 anaplastic astrocytomas, 19 glioblastomas) were included in the study. All patients had undergone primary surgery on the tumour or re-operation of tumour recurrence with implantation of an Ommaya reservoir into the resection cavity. Primary surgery had been followed in 23 of the 24 patients by external radiation therapy and in six patients by additional systemic chemotherapy.

Re). In 20 patients, serial FET PET and MRI scans were performed preceding every RIT cycle and at 3-month intervals after the end of RIT in order to detect tumour recurrence and to monitor the therapeutic effects. In the remaining four patients, follow-up with serial FET PET scans was not started until 10, 12, 17 and 33 months after the end of RIT. Altogether, a total of 119 PET scans were performed.

Visual analysis using a nodular versus a non-nodular uptake pattern as the criterion to distinguish between tumour recurrence and tumour-free status led to correct detection of recurrence in 32 of 34 scans (sensitivity 94%). In 80 of 85 scans performed in a tumour-free status, no additional nodular uptake pattern was present (specificity 94%). In five scans, uptake appeared somewhat focally accentuated owing to circumscribed folding of the cavity wall, and thus mimicked nodular uptake. Restricting visual analysis only to the one scan per patient presenting with the highest FET uptake resulted in correct detection of tumour recurrence in 16 of 17 patients (sensitivity 94%) and of a tumour-free status in five of seven (specificity 71%). In two of seven tumour-free patients, FET uptake that appeared nodular was misleading for reasons mentioned above.

I-labelled monoclonal antibodies. Based on their findings they suggested that the development of such a rim may be dose dependent but independent of malignant disease. Histologically, the metabolic rim was associated with an inflammatory infiltrate consisting of a relatively increased number of macrophages and fibroblasts. Furthermore, malignant recurrence was suggested in the event of development of new nodularity in the non-malignant FDG-accumulating rim.

/BG ratio, whereas in the present study following RIT the threshold value was determined to be 2.4. The somewhat higher unspecific FET uptake after RIT may be explained by a more severe breakdown of the blood-brain barrier, probably induced by the higher local radiation dose. However, based on the limited experience so far, we were not able to document a relationship between extent and time course of FET uptake with the dose administered.

/BG ratio reached the threshold value of 2.4 in only one patient and then in only one (peak) of nine serial scans. In contrast, in the 17 patients presenting with tumour progression during follow-up, PET showed a more focally configured FET uptake in addition to the rim uptake. Semiquantitative evaluation of the slice with the highest uptake showed either stably increased values (in patients with residual tumour) or increasing values, starting from normal ratios and progressing to pathological ratios(in patients who developed recurrence).

/BG ratio and the configuration of FET uptake should be taken into account in order to differentiate optimally between recurrence and benign post-therapeutic effects.

max
/BG<2.4). This approach, however, was not followed in our study owing to the heterogeneous patient group (patients with and without residual tumour at baseline, various intervals between initial surgery and radioimmunotherapy, various starting points of FET PET monitoring). Instead, a Kaplan-Meier analysis for progression-free survival following RIT was performed, showing significantly longer progression-free survival in patients in whom the maximal individual uptake was below the suggested threshold value, compared to those presenting with values above this threshold.
One possible limitation of the present study was the lack of histological confirmation in 15/24 patients, and especially in five of the seven patients who were considered tumour free. Histopathological confirmation would have been ethically hard to justify in these patients, but its lack gives rise to the question of possible false negative findings. Nevertheless, the unsuspicious long-term clinical follow-up in the patients in question and the fact that the study population consisted only of patients with high-grade gliomas, and in particular glioblastomas (19/24 patients), strongly support the PET results.
Another possible limitation is that in four of the 24 patients, follow-up with serial FET PET scans did not start until at least 10 months after the end of RIT, with the consequence that some earlier changes in FET uptake following RIT might have been missed. However, since in three of those four patients FET uptake was still increasing during the initial PET scans, followed by a peak and subsequent decrease, it is unlikely that crucial information was missed. Only in one patient in whom RIT had been completed as long as 33 months prior to the beginning of FET PET monitoring were the post-therapeutic phase of increasing FET uptake and its peak probably missed.

], showing that MRI is insufficient to distinguish between benign side-effects of therapy and tumour recurrence and that FET PET is a powerful tool to improve the differential diagnosis in these patients. Therefore, FET PET might be a method of choice for monitoring locoregional forms of treatment, like RIT, which frequently cause treatment-related inflammatory reactions or tumour necrosis.
Conclusion
This study indicates that FET PET is a sensitive tool for monitoring the effects of high local radiation doses given by intracavitary RIT. Homogeneous, slightly increasing FET uptake around the tumour cavity with a peak up to 18 months after RIT, followed by stable or decreasing FET uptake, is indicative of benign, therapy-related changes. These findings are independent of tumour recurrence and must not be misinterpreted as progressive disease. In contrast, focally increased FET uptake is an early and reliable indicator of tumour progression.
Since both radiation necrosis and active tumour growth can present with clinical deterioration and are often impossible to distinguish by means of structural brain imaging, FET PET may be a powerful tool for planning further patient management. While radiation necrosis may be treated by steroids or, in extensive cases, by debulking surgery, recurrent tumour requires change of ineffective treatment or palliative care only.
