The article reviews the current knowledge about the impulse control disorders (ICDs) with specific emphasis on epidemiological and pharmacological advances. In addition to the traditional ICDs present in the DSM-IV—pathological gambling, trichotillomania, kleptomania, pyromania and intermittent explosive disorder—a brief description of the new proposed ICDs—compulsive–impulsive (C–I) Internet usage disorder, C–I sexual behaviors, C–I skin picking and C–I shopping—is provided. Specifically, the article summarizes the phenomenology, epidemiology and comorbidity of the ICDs. Particular attention is paid to the relationship between ICDs and obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD). Finally, current pharmacological options for treating ICDs are presented and discussed.

], specifically including four new impulsive disorders, compulsive–impulsive (C–I) Internet usage disorder C–I sexual behaviors, C–I skin picking and C–I shopping. They are called compulsive–impulsive disorders due to the impulsive features (arousal) that initiate the behavior, and the compulsive drive that causes the behaviors to persist over time.

]. The pharmacological options, moreover, have been expanded based on recent research; traditional treatment with the serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) supported the OC spectrum model, but recent research demonstrating the efficacy of different pharmacological interventions suggests that additional systems are involved and other models may be useful. For example, the efficacy of pharmacotherapies acting on different systems of neuromediators (opioid antagonists, mood stabilizers, dopamine reuptake inhibitors), support different theoretical models for the ICDs and make clear that it is valuable to look at the ICDs from different theoretical perspectives that suggest different mechanisms might be important and raise new research questions.

ICDs’ phenomenology, epidemiology and relationship with OCD
The failure to resist an impulse to perform some act that is harmful to the individual or others;

An increasing sense of arousal or tension prior to committing or engaging in the act;

An experience of either pleasure, gratification, or release of tension at the time of committing the act.



In addition, there is usually a pattern of engaging in the abnormal behavior in spite of adverse consequences (e.g., criminal changes, impairment of normal functioning, etc.). To demonstrate that a relationship exists between ICDs and OCD, there should be evidence that OCD is overrepresented in patients with ICDs and/or that ICDs are overrepresented in patients with OCD. Studies examining rates of OCD in patients with ICDs have reported inconsistent results, with some ICDs showing relatively high rates of comorbidity with OCD (trichotillomania, CI-shopping), and others demonstrating low rates (intermittent explosive disorder, pathological gambling, and C–I sexual behaviors).

]. Patients with other addictive disorders (alcohol and other substances) and intense urges and craving might particularly benefit from opioid antagonists. Mood stabilizers and anticonvulsants (lithium and divalproex assessed in double-blind controlled trials) have shown good results in recent studies without any specific contraindications for their use across the different subtypes of gamblers. In addition, gamblers with consistent affective instability may particularly benefit from these treatments.

Conclusions
Current knowledge on ICDs in terms of epidemiology and pharmacological treatment varies notably across these disorders, with recent and continuing advances for some (i.e. pathological gambling and C–I shopping), and anecdotal and obsolete data for others. Undoubtedly, given the high prevalence estimates of some ICDs (i.e. pathological gambling and C–I sexual behaviors) as well as their comorbidity with other major psychiatric disorders, this group of disorders represents a global problem. Nevertheless, certain ICDs (i.e, pyromania, C–I Internet usage disorder) still need systematic epidemiological and pharmacological research.
Studying the relationships between specific ICDs and other major psychiatric conditions (i.e. OCD, bipolar disorders, addictive disorders) in terms of phenomenological issues and comorbidity patterns is not only of theoretical interest; indeed, it provides the rationale for the use of specific pharmacological treatments and behavioral interventions. From this perspective, more than one decade after its introduction, the conceptualization of ICDs as obsessive–compulsive related disorders is still valid and has been confirmed by numerous studies; however, there is also evidence supporting the relationship between ICDs and addictive and affective disorders. Not only are the different models of conceptualizing the ICDs not mutually exclusive, but they can contribute to recognize specific subtypes within the disorders. As a result, different models of conceptualization of ICDs have led new developments in pharmacologic treatment of these disorders, with positive results obtained with mood stabilizers and opioid antagonists in addition to the SSRIs.
