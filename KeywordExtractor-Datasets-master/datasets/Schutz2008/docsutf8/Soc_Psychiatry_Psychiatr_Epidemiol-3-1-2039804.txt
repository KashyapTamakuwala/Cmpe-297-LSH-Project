Background
A long asylum procedure is associated with higher prevalence rates of psychiatric disorders, lower quality of life, higher disability and more physical health problems. Additional knowledge about health seeking behavior is necessary to guide governments and health professionals in their policies.

Objective
To measure service use among one of the biggest asylum seekers population in the Netherlands and to assess its relationships with predisposing and need variables (including post-migration living problems).

Method
n
n
 = 151), more than 2 years in the Netherlands. Respondents were interviewed with fully structured, culturally validated, translated questionnaires, which contained instruments to measure psychiatric disorders, quality of life, disability, physical health and post-migration living problems. Use of preventive and curative (physical and mental) health services was measured and the relationship with predisposing and need risk factors was estimated with univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses.

Results
A long asylum procedure is not associated with higher service use, except for mental health service use and drug use. Use of mental health services is, however, low compared to the prevalence of psychiatric disorders. Low quality of perceived general health and functional disability are the most important predictors of services use. Psychopathology predicts use of a medical specialist (non-psychiatrist), but does not predict mental health service use.

Conclusion
A high percentage of asylum seekers with a psychiatric disorder is not getting adequate treatment. There is a mismatch between the type of health problem and the type of health service use. The various health services should work together in education, detection, referral and care in order to provide help to this group of patients.

] used the model in a study among migrants in Amsterdam and found that there were migrant-specific mechanisms in health care consumption. Higher levels of acculturation and lower level of cultural traditionalism increased the use of mental health care facilities.
In these health service use studies, a variety of potential predictors, such as psychopathology, physical diseases, physical, and mental well-being, have been included. But disability and quality of life were not included. Nor is there a study that compared groups from the same country of origin, that differ in length of stay in a host country.

] we measured prevalence rates of psychiatric disorders, quality of life, disability, and physical health problems in relationship with pre- and post-migrations stressors. The study focuses on the risks of a long asylum procedure and showed that asylum seekers who stayed more than 2 years in the Netherlands had significantly higher overall prevalence rates of psychiatric disorders (66.2%), than those who arrived recently (42.0%). A long asylum procedure was an important independent risk factor for a psychiatric disorder with an odds ratio of 2.16 (CI 1.15–4.08). This ratio was higher than the odds ratio for premigration stressors, such as exposure to human rights violations. In addition the ‘long stay’ group had significantly lower quality of life, higher disability, and higher levels of physical health complaints. In the Anderson model these health indicators can be considered as need factors.
The aim of this paper is to examine patterns and predictors of health service use and their relationship with length of stay. The research questions are: (a) what is the prevalence of service use of Iraqi asylum seekers in the Netherlands, (b) is a long asylum procedure associated with a higher prevalence of service use, (c) what is the relationship between psychopathology and service use, and (d) which predisposing and other need variables predict service use. We hypothesize that a long asylum procedure is associated with a higher prevalence of service use and that higher levels of psychopathology are related to higher levels of service use.

Methods

]. A summary is given below.
From the entire population of adult Iraqi asylum seekers, two groups were selected based on their length of stay in the Netherlands. Personal data on these groups was obtained from the Agency for the Reception of Asylum Seekers (COA). Group 1 was selected on the criterion that persons had been living in the Netherlands for less than 6 months (between September 2000 and November 2001). From the randomly selected 362 respondents, data could be used from 143 interviews. Group 2 was selected on the criterion that they were living in the Netherlands for at least 2 years. On the chosen date of May 31st, 1999, the COA found that 2,352 Iraqi asylum seekers fulfilled this criterion. From the randomly selected 474 respondents, data could be used from 151 interviews.

The use of drugs in respondents with psychopathology was higher in both groups, compared to those without psychopathology. Almost 60% of the respondents in Group 2 with psychopathology used drugs, versus 21.6% of those without psychopathology. Also the use of analgetics was higher, especially in Group 2 (48% vs. 17.6%).

Discussion
The main findings of this study are: There is a high overall service use among Iraqi asylum seekers in the Netherlands. The hypothesis that a long asylum procedure is associated with higher levels of service use, is not confirmed by the results, except for mental health service use and drug use. Psychopathology is related to a higher level of service use (second hypothesis), but when corrected for the influence of other predisposing and need factors, other factors, such as: high role and functional disability, and low perceived quality of general health, are more important predictors. Moreover having one or more psychiatric disorder(s) predicts the use of a medical specialist (non-psychiatrist), but does not predict mental health service use. The overall use of mental health service use is very low compared to the high prevalence of psychiatric disorder: over 80% of the asylum seekers with a psychiatric disorder used any health service, but only 8.8% visited a mental health service.
Next paragraphs will discuss the four research questions.
Prevalence of service use, relationship with length of stay
9
] found that 63.7% of the asylum seekers from Iran, Afghanistan and Somalia reported a visit to the preventive healthcare services in the center. Their average length of stay was 3.4 years, comparable with Group 2. The rate of the Iraqi group in this study is much lower: 39.7%, suggesting a difference in use of this service between asylum seekers with different origins.
27
24
] found that asylum seekers visit the general practitioner less often than the general Dutch population: number of contacts per year 3.5 vs. 4.5. So, despite the higher prevalence of health problems, asylum seekers make less use of the general practitioner. Furthermore, use of a medical specialist is not higher in Group 2. This is explained by the fact that in the Dutch system a patient can only visit a medical specialist after referral by a general practitioner.
9
] found an even higher rate (57.8%). The high use of analgetics is striking (see later).
Use of alternative services is very low. Maybe Iraqi asylum seekers are not interested in these services, but even in case they would be, these services are probably not easily available and accessible. We found no other studies on this issue among Iraqi refugees/asylum seekers.

Relationship psychopathology and service use
3
). However 60.6% visited a nurse/doctor in the center and 33.8% the general practitioner. Both services are important in the pathway to mental health care (see later).
23
] did a qualitative study among 22 asylum seekers and concluded that it seems that “the prescription of paracetamol has become a symbol for the lack of interest of and the rejection by the health care system”. Their study reports dissatisfaction with the services of the nurse/doctor in the center, as well as with the services of the general practitioner.

Predictors of service use
8
17
14
24
]. They found that in only 6% of the cases ‘mental health problems’ was recorded as reason of visiting the medical staff in the center, and only 2% of the referrals to the general practitioners were because of mental health reasons. The general practitioner diagnosed a mental health problem in 10% of the cases, and of those only 21.4% were referred to a mental health service (while 33.3% was referred to a medical specialist).
5
6
) psychopathology did not predict the use of a medical specialist in this group.
10
15
].
Several post-migration living problems (PMLP) predict health service use in Group 2. Especially worries about socio-economic living conditions increase the need for healthcare. The findings do not support the idea that asylum seekers look for recognition of their health problems in order to get a resident permit: there is no relationship between PMLP and mental health service use and there is a negative relationship with use of a medical specialist.


Conclusion
This study has shown that Iraqi asylum seekers have a low level of mental health service use, despite the high levels of psychiatric disorders and other health indicators, especially within the group that stayed in the asylum procedure for over 2 years.
Moreover, there is a mismatch between the type of health problem and the type of health service use: asylum seekers with a psychiatric disorder make more use of non-mental health service. There is room for improvement of the ‘gate way’ preventive services in detection and referrals of patients with mental health problems. The study results suggest that this service is a barrier rather than a facilitator in the pathway to mental health care. The general practitioner should be more involved and consulted. Mental health institutions are recommended to start and/or improve consultation and (assertive) care programs.


The study was supported by GGZ Drenthe and the foundation De Open Ankh. We thank the Iraqi interviewers and the participants of the study for their co-operation.
