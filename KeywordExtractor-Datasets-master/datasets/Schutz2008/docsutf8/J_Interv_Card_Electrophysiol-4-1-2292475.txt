Objectives
To compare the acute success and short-term follow-up of ablation of atrial flutter using 8 mm tip radiofrequency (RF) and cryocatheters.

Methods
Sixty-two patients with atrial flutter were randomized to RF or cryocatheter (cryo) ablation. Right atrial angiography was performed to assess the isthmus. End point was bidirectional isthmus block on multiple criteria. A pain score was used and the analgesics were recorded. Patients were followed for at least 3 months.

 = 0.117). This was similar for both groups, as was the distribution of anatomic variations. Recurrences and complaints in the successful patients were similar for both groups, with a very low recurrence of atrial flutter after initial success.

Conclusions
In this randomized study there was no statistical difference but a trend to less favorable outcome with 8 mm tip cryocatheters compared to RF catheters for atrial flutter ablation. Cryoablation was associated with less discomfort, fewer applications, shorter fluoroscopy times and similar procedure times. The recurrence rate was very low. Cryotherapy can be considered for atrial flutter ablation under certain circumstances especially when it has been used previously in the same patient, such as in an AF ablation.

Important developments in the field of atrial flutter ablation have been a better understanding of the anatomy of the isthmus, refinements of the definition of bidirectional isthmus block, and the arrival of new catheter technology.

]. The development of 6 and 8 mm tip cryocatheters has increased the interest in this technology for atrial flutter ablation. As far as we are aware there have been no randomized comparative studies published comparing 8 mm tip cryocatheters with 8 mm tip RF catheters.

Methods
Patient population
Consecutive patients with ongoing symptoms and documented atrial flutter with or without fibrillation were included. At least one recent episode of atrial flutter (within the last 6 months) was documented on a 12 lead ECG and was suggestive for isthmus dependency. Patients with drug-induced flutter (and prior AF) could be included, and had their drug therapy continued after ablation. Patients were excluded if they had undergone a previous flutter ablation, if thrombus was present in the atria, or after previous cardiac surgery for valvular or congenital heart disease. Baseline investigations included a standard echocardiogram, a simple questionnaire asking about clinical wellbeing and a subjective assessment of the arrhythmia burden both in terms of duration and frequency. The study was approved by the ethics committee of our institution. All patients signed written informed consent.

Assessment before ablation
Antiarrhythmic drugs, except for AV nodal slowing agents, and amiodarone, were discontinued at least five half-lives prior to ablation. Patients were studied in the fasting, post-absorptive state. A coronary sinus (CS) catheter was inserted through the left subclavian vein, and a multipolar circular right atrial catheter with alternating 2–10–2 mm interelectrode distance was positioned from the right groin, with the tip positioned immediately lateral to the planned position of the isthmus line and anterior to the crista terminalis. Heparin 100 U/kg was given and a further 5 U/kg given if the procedure lasted longer than 180 min.
If the patient was in sinus rhythm, isthmus conduction was confirmed by pacing. If flutter was present, entrainment was performed to confirm isthmus dependence, and the patient left in flutter. If AF was present, the patient was cardioverted after a transoesophageal echocardiogram, and then isthmus conduction confirmed. Absence of isthmus conduction or non-isthmus dependence was not seen in the selected patients. No induction of arrhythmia was attempted if patients had sinus rhythm.
14
]. Morphology was assessed visually as to the presence of a Eustachian valve or a recess, as well as to the general shape i.e. flat or concave.

Ablation procedure
The catheters were a 9Fr 8 mm tip catheter (FreezorMax, Cryocath Technologies Inc, Kirkland, Canada) with a cryoconsole for the cryoablation group, and a 7Fr 8 mm tip single sensor catheter (EPT Blazer II, Boston Scientific, Natick, MA, USA) with an EPT-1000XP generator for the radiofrequency group. A large curve was initially selected in both groups, with change out of catheter curve during the study only as necessary. Applications of −75°, for 4 min were given with cryothermy, and applications of 60 Watt, for 60 s, targeted at 60°C for RF. Lines were made with discrete applications between the tricuspid valve and the inferior vena cava at an approximately 6 o’clock position in LAO 45°, unless otherwise dictated. If termination of atrial flutter occurred, or if the patient was in sinus rhythm, continuous pacing from the proximal coronary sinus was employed to continually assess isthmus conduction. After the first line, a new assessment of conduction was performed. If conduction over the isthmus remained present, gaps were sought. If there was still isthmus conduction, a slightly more medial or lateral line was made. In no patient was an attempt made to perform a septal ablation line. Final assessment of acute block was confirmed after 30 min waiting.
The end point for successful ablation was induction of complete bidirectional isthmus block, defined as the presence of reversal of activation on the lateral and septal wall when pacing the CS os and low lateral RA, the presence of widely split potentials along the isthmus line, by activation mapping across the isthmus, and by differential pacing. All 4 were required before calling the ablation successful. In the case where bidirectional block was not achieved, ablation was stopped when no large, sharp signals could be identified over a broad area of the isthmus.
As pain perception was assessed, sedation was standardized. Before venous puncture 5 mg of diazepam was given intravenously, and repeated at the patient’s request. Fentanyl 50 μg intravenously was given when the patient requested pain control and the physician considered this necessary. This was repeated as needed. Dosages of both diazepam and fentanyl were recorded.
In the initial 40 patients creatine kinase (CK) and CK-MB were taken before the procedure, 2 and 24 h after the start of the procedure. For the final 22 patients the laboratory had changed the measurement to CK mass. We then modified the protocol to measure CK-MB mass, Troponin T, and Myoglobin at 4 and 24 h after the start of the procedure.
No crossover, other than in catheter curve, was allowed in an attempt to remove any possible bias. Change over to an irrigated tip ablation catheter was also not allowed. In patients in whom no block could be induced, a repeat procedure was scheduled not earlier than 6 weeks after the initial ablation, at the physicians’ discretion. The choice of energy source at that time was at the physicians’ discretion.
Patients were all questioned with regard to pain perception using a visual analogue score, where patients are shown a line from 0 to 10, where 0 is no pain, and 10 is the highest pain level imaginable, and were asked to point to the position on the line where their pain level during ablation was.

Follow-up
All patients received an event-recorder for the first 6 weeks after the procedure and were requested to send at least daily strips as well as strips made during symptoms. Patients visited the outpatient clinic 6 weeks after the procedure. After this period all patients were asked to report symptoms and if these were present were given a further event monitor until documentation of symptoms was obtained. If at all possible a 12 lead ECG was also obtained. A second assessment with a questionnaire was performed after 3 months, again asking a question about general clinical well being and also symptom burden in regard to duration and frequency. Clinical files were followed up after 9 months.

Follow-up results

 = ns).
A total of 6 patients were taking no antiarrhythmic medication prior to ablation and this increased to 13 post isthmus ablation.
Recurrent arrhythmias were frequent in both groups of patients. ECG documented recurrent flutter occurred only in one patient from the RF group. A further procedure confirmed recovery of isthmus conduction. This recurrence was seen at 14 months post ablation, whereas he had previously had monthly episodes of flutter. One other patient had symptoms with an apparently non-isthmus dependent flutter documented on ECG on day 1 post ablation and not since, and elected not to have a further procedure. We cannot exclude asymptomatic arrhythmias but at least during the first 6 weeks, patients sent in daily event monitor transmissions, which one would hope would have captured at least some asymptomatic recurrences, particularly of atrial flutter.
In 11 of 15 patients in whom the initial procedure failed, a redo procedure was performed after the elected period of 6 weeks because of documented recurrent flutter. The redo procedure required a small number of point touch ups in five patients (three in the RF group and two in the cryo group), while more extensive diffuse isthmus applications were required in six (one in the RF group and five in the cryo group). In those undergoing repeat ablation, success was achieved in all and during follow up no recurrent atrial flutter was noted.
Previously undocumented atrial tachycardias were also seen in both groups (three in the RF group, and two in the cryo group). ECG documented AF recurrence occurred in 28 patients, at a similar rate in both groups (15 in the RF group and 13 in the cryo group). The likelihood of asymptomatic recurrences is probably higher for atrial fibrillation but was not the primary focus of this study.


Discussion
Acute success
This study showed an acute success rate of 83% for an 8 mm tip RF catheter vs. 69% for an 8 mm tip cryocatheter. This non significant difference is clearly concerning. However, the cryoablation group required significantly less applications to achieve success, with a similar procedural duration, significantly lower fluoroscopy time, and with a much lower requirement for analgesia with fentanyl. Arrhythmia recurrences in the initially successful patients were similar with a very low flutter recurrence rate.

Difficulties during ablation
Recurrence during or shortly after ablation occurring more commonly in the cryo group probably relates to a reversible cooling effect at the periphery of the ice ball which recovers during or shortly after termination of ablation, while the central lesion acutely formed is more permanent. The more common recurrence during the waiting period after RF ablation probably relates to a longer reversal time of the acute RF effects (either edema or temperature effect).

Higher peak CK levels, confirmed by the high CK-mass in the last patients, suggest that the damage caused by cryotherapy may be more extensive despite the lower number of applications. Several explanations are possible. The first is that the CK levels may be underestimated after RF, which denatures proteins in another way than cryotherapy. Troponin T levels are more accurate in estimation of myocardial damage, but they also tended to be higher, be it not significantly. This may suggest that lesions are equal with both approaches.
