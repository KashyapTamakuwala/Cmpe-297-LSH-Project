At 6 years of age (December 2000–February 2003) the children were investigated for body size, body composition and risk factors for type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease. Families were instructed to continue their usual diet and activity prior to the study, and were transported to the Research Unit the previous evening. They were provided with a standard dinner and then water only until the next morning. A fasting blood sample was collected, followed by a 1.75 g/kg body weight oral anhydrous glucose load and a further blood sample 120 min later.

]. Weight and height were measured using standardised protocols. Whole-body dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scans (Lunar DPX-IQ 240; Lunar Corporation, Madison, WI, USA; paediatric software) were carried out to measure total, truncal and leg fat mass, percentage body fat and lean mass. Standard quality assurance tests were performed every day. The DEXA machine was installed 3 months after the study started, and therefore 59 children had DEXA measurements later than the other investigations.

 concentration was more strongly associated with insulin resistance than the 28 week value, while the reverse was true for erythrocyte folate. The lifespan of erythrocytes (4 months) means that 28 week erythrocyte folate reflects nutritional status earlier in pregnancy. Thus, early-mid pregnancy may be a critical period for the programming of adiposity and insulin resistance.

]. On the other hand, the positive associations of maternal folate and intakes of GLVs and dairy products with adiposity or insulin resistance in the children, are contrary to the hypothesis because they predicted larger offspring size at birth. Our results suggest a need for caution in designing nutritional strategies to improve fetal growth and future health based on relationships with birth size alone.

A limitation of the study is that it is observational, and therefore causality cannot be ascertained.
