Background
Mechanical bowel preparation (MBP) prior to elective colorectal surgery has been in use for many years. It is considered important in preventing post-operative infectious complications after colorectal surgery. The evidence to support these claims is lacking within the medical literature and yet this still remains standard practice in many hospitals. A literature search was undertaken to ascertain the evidence available regarding the use of MBP in elective colorectal surgery.

Methods
The search included the databases PubMed, Medline and Embase using the keywords “mechanical bowel preparation”, “bowel cleansing” and “elective colorectal surgery”, a search of recent issues of relevant journals including Diseases of the Colon and Rectum and British Journal of Surgery and backward chaining from articles obtained.

Results and Conclusion
Most authors recommend that colorectal surgery is safe without pre-operative MBP but that there may some situations in which it may be beneficial (e.g. if there is a small tumour or the possible need for intra-operative colonoscopy). The implication for clinical practice in this situation is that there is not enough strength of evidence at present to recommend a change in practice. There is a need for further higher powered trials to try to answer this question definitively.

 and backward chaining from articles obtained. The search was restricted to English language articles and a timescale of 10 years was chosen to give a balanced view of this topic.
In this review, mechanical bowel preparation will be defined as an oral preparation given prior to surgery to clear faecal material from the bowel lumen. There are a number of different preparations available including polyethylene glycol, mannitol and sodium picosulphate. Rectal enemas may also be administered before low anterior resections to ensure that the rectum is empty.
Elective colorectal surgery is defined as any surgery undertaken on a planned basis for any condition of the colon or rectum requiring bowel resection and primary anastomosis. This will include colorectal carcinoma and inflammatory bowel disease.

 found a statistically significant increase in the incidence of wound infection in those patients receiving MBP when considering the three included RCTs. This may have been influenced by the rate of wound infection seen in one trial that used a five day regime of MBP. The anastomotic leakage rate was also higher in the MBP group but not significantly so. Each RCT used a different type of MBP and this lack of standardisation affects the validity of the results. The included studies were also underpowered thereby introducing a high possibility that they failed to detect a significant difference in the results (type II error). Evidence from the prospective and retrospective studies was in favour of no MBP in pre-operative period.
et al
9
 appraised four RCTs. One of the studies found an increased risk of anastomotic leakage and intra-abdominal infection but no increased risk of wound infection in the group of patients receiving MBP. The remaining RCTs found no significant difference in intra-abdominal infection rate but a slight increase in wound infection rate in the MBP group.
There were conflicting results in the non-randomised studies with some showing an increased rate of infection and others reporting no difference in infection rates between the groups.

found that although initial analysis showed a significantly higher rate of anastomotic leakage in the MBP group, this significance disappears when sensitivity analyses are applied thereby weakening the conclusion that MBP leads to an increased rate of anastomotic leakage.
et al
8
 found there was significantly more anastomotic leakage in the group of patients receiving MBP and a tendency to a higher rate of wound infection but this was not statistically significant. This group repeated the analysis excluding the poor quality trials and the results still favoured a no MBP regime although this was not statistically significant.

also mention that the use of pre-operative radiotherapy would be an important consideration in assessment of bowel preparation for rectal surgery as many patients with rectal cancer undergo pre-operative radiotherapy.

 with 415 patients recruited. There are several flaws in the methodology of this trial introducing bias and compromising the validity of the results.
There was no difference found in the rate of post-operative infectious complications between the two groups. The rate of diarrhoea post-operatively was significantly more common in the group receiving MBP but this is of little clinical significance, as many patients will experience an increased stool frequency once the bowels become active. The authors acknowledge that separating the role of MBP in post-operative infection rate is difficult and ideally all other measures should be constant. They also note that the study is underpowered to detect a 5% difference in infection rate.
et al
5
 comparing MBP with no MBP in patients undergoing elective left-sided colorectal surgery found an increase in the total incidence of infectious abdominal complications in the group receiving MBP (22% v 8%; p=0.028). This led the authors to conclude that there was good evidence to suggest that the practice of MBP should be re-evaluated. They gave an enema pre-operatively to all patients undergoing an anterior resection regardless of whether they had been randomised to MBP or not, decreasing the internal validity of the results. If anastomotic leak rate (a more clinically important outcome than wound infection) were to be used as the primary end-point then the study would need 514 patients in each group.

 was not properly randomised, introducing methodological bias and limiting the value of the results of this study. There was no definition of sample size and patients with low rectal anastomosis were excluded. Again, the assessor of outcome was not blinded to the intervention, introducing another source of bias. No statistically significant difference in the frequency of infectious complications was observed between the groups yet the authors concluded that “mechanical bowel preparation is unnecessary for safe elective colonic and colorectal surgery". But they recommend MBP in selected cases including the resection of small tumours when palpation of the colon may be necessary or when intra-operative colonoscopy may be performed.
et al
13
 conducted a well-designed multi-centre RCT, reported in 2005. Approximately half the resections carried out in this study were left-sided. This is important as it is now generally accepted that right-sided anastomosis is safe without MBP. This study excluded patients undergoing rectal surgery. There was no significant difference in wound infection or anastomotic leak rate but the bacterial swab results used to define wound infection in this study were only correctly obtained in 185 out of 250 patients therefore this may not be an accurate reflection of the true rate of wound infections. This study could not demonstrate an additional protective effect for MBP but it was an interim analysis and was underpowered. As a result, conclusions for clinical practice cannot be drawn from these results.
et al
11
 reported the results of a prospective, randomised study including patients undergoing rectal surgery. There was no significant difference in infectious complications found between the two groups but it is difficult to conclude on the influence on anastomotic leakage from these results as the study included patients who did not undergo an anastomosis.
10

. All these studies agree that elective colorectal surgery may be safely performed without MBP and that there is no evidence to continue this invasive practice with potentially negative side effects.
et
al
16
 carried out a retrospective non-randomised trial based on operating surgeon preferences using a questionnaire. The validity of this questionnaire is unclear as no pilot study was carried out prior to the collection of definitive data. Follow-up of the patients was obtained using the hospital records therefore relying on accurate clinical notes, which are not always available.
One hundred and thirty six patients who underwent elective left-sided colorectal procedures for non-obstructive large bowel pathologies were identified using the hospital computer system. Coding errors may mean that some eligible patients were excluded from the analysis. This, along with the lack of randomisation, would introduce significant bias.
No statistical difference was found between the two groups for all infectious complications and mortality. The authors recognise the limitations of their results and do not recommend any changes in practice but do suggest that a prospective randomised trial should be performed to demonstrate the impact of MBP on morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery.
et al
17
 assessed the outcome of 250 consecutive patients who underwent resection and primary anastomosis of the colon and upper rectum under the care of a single surgeon. None of these patients received MBP pre-operatively. Both emergency and elective procedures were included in analysis. Results were favourable with an overall wound infection rate of 3.3% and an anastomotic failure rate for left-sided resections of 1.2%. The authors recommend that more powerful randomised trials are needed but in the hands of a single surgeon, primary anastomosis of unprepared bowel is safe with relatively few complications.
et al
4
 found an anastomotic leak rate of 4.2% and a wound infection rate of 8.5%. The average age of the sample was lower than that of the typical population undergoing colorectal surgery. This fact, plus the small sample size, compromises the external validity or the extent to which the results can be generalised to other samples or situations.

CONCLUSION

. There is a need for larger clinical trials in this area to address whether MBP, with its potential side effects, is truly necessary prior to elective colorectal surgery.

 as this is a common occurrence in patients who have rectal carcinoma and these patients may subsequently undergo resection with primary anastomosis. It is clear that further research is needed to clarify the role of MBP in elective colorectal surgery to ensure that the patients are receiving the most appropriate treatment with the least adverse effects.
