Flow cytometric analysis
Total splenocyte suspensions were separated into lymphocyte and non-lymphocyte fractions by magnetic cell sorting (MACS, Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) using anti-CD3-Biotin (clone 145-2C11, BD Pharmingen), anti-Biotin MicroBeads, anti-CD19 MicroBeads and LS MACS columns (Miltenyi Biotec). Skin cell suspensions were prepared from shaved abdominal skin plus one ear pinna by mincing followed by an incubation with 2 mg/ml collagenase IV (Worthington Biochem. Corporation, Lakewood, NJ, USA) at 37°C. Cells in peritoneal lavage as well as single cell suspensions from skin and spleen were stained with phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated anti-CD3 (clone 145-2C11), anti-CD19 (clone 1D3); anti-CD11c (clone HL3), anti-CD45 (clone 30-F11) and anti-Siglec-F (clone E50-2440) (all from BD Pharmingen) or anti-FcεRIα-PE (clone MAR-1), allophycocyanin (APC)-conjugated anti-CD117 (clone 2B8) and anti-CD49b (clone D×5), F4/80-Biotin (clone BM8) and streptavidin-PE (all from eBiosciences, SanDiego, CA) or anti-Gr-1-PE (clone RB6-8C5) (Miltenyi Biotech). The cells were analyzed on a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences).

). Given that the mast cell gate will inevitably collect also some non-mast cells upon analysis of high total cell numbers (40,000 events), the percentage of skin mast cells expressing EYFP is probably close to 100%. A similar efficiency of Cre-mediated activation of the reporter gene was observed in three male X-Mcpt5-Cre mice (not shown) whereas the two female animals analyzed showed EYFP fluorescence in only 61% and 32% of peritoneal mast cells consistent with random X-chromosome inactivation (not shown).
