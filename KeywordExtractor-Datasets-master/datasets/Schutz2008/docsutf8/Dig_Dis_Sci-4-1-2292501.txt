]. In other words, the relationship between specific upper abdominal sensations and the above-mentioned mechanisms remains to be matter of debate.
We conducted a study to assess the relationship between gastric function and upper abdominal sensations. Gastric emptying rate, proximal gastric relaxation, and maximum drinking capacity were assessed in FD patients. The symptoms experienced in daily life (chronic upper abdominal symptoms) were assessed and related to the primary outcome parameters of the gastric function tests. We hypothesised that chronic upper abdominal symptoms and specific pathophysiologic mechanisms have no correlation in functional dyspepsia.

Materials and methods
Patients

], were subjected to three non-invasive functional tests of the stomach. A total of 60 functional dyspeptic patients were prospectively evaluated; 43 female (median age 40 years; range 18–65) and 17 male (median age 37 years; range 21–64).
The inclusion criteria were (a) the presence of dyspeptic symptoms, assessed using the questionnaire described below; (b) no evidence of macroscopic inflammation of the esophageal mucosa or focal lesions of the esophagogastroduodenal mucosa at upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (performed within 1-year prior to inclusion); (c) no abnormalities seen during upper abdominal ultrasonography (performed within 1 year prior to inclusion); (d) absence of serious concomitant illness; and (e) the absence of major gastrointestinal surgery (excluding appendectomy).
The protocol was approved by the ethics committee of the University Medical Center Utrecht. All patients gave written informed consent for inclusion in the trial.

]. Patients were asked to score six different symptoms (pain or discomfort centered in the upper abdomen, early satiety, bloating in the upper abdomen, fullness, nausea, and vomiting) from 0 to 5 (0 = none, 1 = very mild; awareness of symptoms but easily tolerated, 2 = mild; tolerated without interference with usual activity, 3 = moderate; enough to cause some interference with usual activity, 4 = severe; enough to cause significant interference with usual activity, 5 = very severe; incapacitating with inability to work or do usual activity). For inclusion, two of these symptoms had to be scored as moderate, severe or very severe and these symptoms needed to be present for at least 12 weeks, not necessary consecutive, in the preceding 12 months.

Study protocol
All patients underwent three functional tests of the stomach on three separate days; the ¹³C-octanoic breath test, three-dimensional ultrasonography of the stomach, and a nutrient drink test. The order of the three study days was arbitrary. Each of the study days started at 08:00 h after an overnight fast of at least 10 h. The time interval between the tests was three days to 2 weeks. Patients were asked to discontinue any medication known to influence gastrointestinal motility or sensitivity for at least 7 days prior to the study, including PPI therapy. The use of narcotics, anticholinergic medication, serotonergic medication (including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors), and antidepressants was considered an exclusion criterion. None of the patients were on NSAID therapy.

C-sodium-octanoic acid (598 μmol; Campro Scientific, Veenendaal, The Netherlands), dissolved in 1 ml distilled water. Breath samples were taken at baseline, before the meal and from start of ingestion of the meal every 2 min the first 30 min, every 5 min for the next 30 min and every 15 min thereafter up to 4 h.

]. Ultrasonographic data were acquired in a sitting position, while fasting and at 5, 15, 30, 45, and 60 min after ingestion of a nutrient drink. The nutrient drink (500 ml) consisted of 200 ml lactose- and fiber-free milk drink, containing 12.0 g proteins, 11.6 g fat and 36.8 g carbohydrate (300 kcal) (Nutridrink, Nutricia, Zoetermeer, The Netherlands) mixed with 300 ml of water, and was ingested within 3 min.

]. The 2D sagittal planes were used to draw the region of interest, corresponding to the inner layer of the stomach wall (the interface between the outer profile of the gastric wall mucosa and the liquid nutrition). A 3D reconstructed image of the stomach and the gastric volume was obtained using software with rendering and volume estimation capability (In Vivo ScanNT, Medcom GmbH, Darmstadt, Germany).

Secondly, the relationship between chronic upper abdominal symptoms and half-emptying time, retention after 120 min, fasting gastric volume, proximal gastric volume ratio, distal gastric volume ratio, and maximum tolerated volume (continuous variable) was analysed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA).
We have analysed the effect of age, height, weight, BMI, and sex on the outcome of the gastric function tests and the chronic symptoms using a regression analysis. All variables were tested in single models and using multivariable analysis.

Discussion
The following were the most important findings of this study: (1) no relationship was found between chronic upper abdominal symptoms and gastric function (proximal gastric relaxation, gastric emptying rate, or drinking capacity), (2) a third of all FD patients had a normal gastric emptying rate and a normal proximal gastric relaxation, and only a small overlap existed between the two pathophysiologic disorders (7%), and (3) there was an absence of any relationship between maximum drinking capacity and proximal gastric relaxation or gastric emptying rate.

].
For assessment of partial gastric volumes we used 3D-US as a noninvasive alternative for the barostat technique. Recently, a head-to-head comparison between the barostat and 3D-US was performed, in which it was shown that 3D-US was able to identify almost all patients with impaired accommodation assessed by barostat. It was, however, emphasized that the two techniques are not interchangeable, which is likely to be due to the difference in invasiveness of both techniques. Since there is no absolute concordance between the two techniques, we must preserve some reservations in generalizing the results of the current study.

 < 0.001). A strong placebo effect and cognitive influences like motivation should therefore be considered as confounding factors. No differences in age, sex, BMI, chronic symptoms, or upper abdominal sensations experienced during the drink test were observed between the patients who participated in the pharmacological trial and those who did not.
In summary, the maximum drinking capacity of FD patients, seen at a tertiary referral practice, is not influenced by gastric emptying rate or proximal gastric relaxation. The question is raised what usefulness this test has, in terms of diagnosis or treatment options, in FD patients and as a tool to analyze gastric function or upper abdominal sensations. Since we did not find any relationship between upper abdominal symptoms and MTV, the nutrient drink test cannot be regarded as an alternative for measuring visceral perception, as can be done by gastric barostat. In our opinion, many subjective factors, like motivation, probably play an important disturbing factor in the outcome of the test.
In conclusion, in spite of a high prevalence of impaired proximal accommodation and delayed gastric emptying in FD patients, the lack of correlation between chronic upper abdominal sensations and gastric function questions the role of these pathophysiologic mechanisms in the generation of symptoms. Consequently, gastric function does not serve as a clear marker for the symptoms experienced by FD patients in daily life, and limited effect on symptoms may be expected when targeting these specific mechanisms. Finally, despite many efforts, no (measurable) motoric disorder can be appointed as a possible pathophysiologic mechanism underlying the presence of upper abdominal symptoms. Most likely, other factors like visceral perception play a vital role in functional dyspepsia.
