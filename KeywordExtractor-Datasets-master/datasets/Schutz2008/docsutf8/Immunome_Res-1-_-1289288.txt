.
An epitope is any molecular structure that can be recognised by the immune, or other biological, system. Epitopes, or the antigen from which they are derived, can be composed of protein, carbohydrate, lipid, nucleotide, or a combination thereof. It is through recognition of foreign, or non-self, epitopes that the immune system can identify and, hopefully, destroy pathogens. Hitherto, peptide epitopes have been the best studied, and have, traditionally, have been categorized as either T cell or B cell epitopes. T cell epitopes are peptides presented to the cellular arm of the immune system via the MHC-peptide-TCR complex. B cell epitopes represent surface regions of an antigen that are bound by soluble or membrane-bound antibodies. If this region of a protein antigen is comprised of residues distally separated within the primary structure, and brought into local proximity by protein folding, then it is termed a discontinuous or conformational B cell epitope. Linear or continuous B cell epitope residues are sequential in both primary structure and thus as a region on the proteins' surface. Such epitopes are predominantly identified by antigen-specific antibody cross-reactivity with peptides.

]. A more in-depth B cell epitope archive should aid the development of prediction strategies. Antigen recognition by the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) is vital to T cell activation hence, the inclusion of thermodynamic data on the binding of peptides to MHC molecules and T Cell Receptor (TCR) binding to peptide-MHC (pMHC) complexes. This data is complemented by kinetic data based on the same molecular interactions. Data on antigen processing and presentation is also included in AntiJen. Binding data derived from peptide interactions with the Transporter Associated with Antigen Processing (TAP transporter) are included in the archive. Additionally, quantitative specificity data from position-specific peptide libraries is included. AntiJen also incorporates thermodynamic data on protein-protein interactions, within an immunological context, such as co-receptor and superantigen binding, plus interactions with the MHC. All of these interactions are, potentially, key factors for the successful computational design of vaccines.

], the interface to AntiJen is entirely new, having been completely rewritten. AntiJen has been designed and implemented using postgreSQL, a system comprising a relational database and database server, and has thus established increased database robustness, creating an improved infrastructure for foreseeable issues of data storage and data growth. Data within AntiJen is structured into twenty-four normalised tables. Each is category specific and holds either statistical or experimental data. Additional tables accommodate the keyword data – which powers our protein-orientated antigen search and allows integration of the BLAST search – and there is also a structural data table to accommodate links to external structural databases. The user interface consists of a series of HTML forms. The search requests from these forms target PERL scripts integrated with SQL which in turn query the database.

. An allele is named using a defined pattern. For example, for HLA-A*0101: the HLA-A refers to the HLA locus; the first 01 to the serologically recognized A1 antigen and the final 01 to the individual HLA allele protein sequence. AntiJen stores the antigen classification (i.e. HLA-A1) and, when available, the specific allele. We have often encountered problems with the nonstandard allele reporting. A 4-digit HLA name necessarily implies the two digit serological antigen, a two digit classification clearly does not imply a specific allele.

Subsidiary Databases in AntiJen
The AntiJen database contains a number of sub-databases. Each of these contains data on different aspects of the biological function and/or biophysical properties of different classes of immunomacromolecule. We describe the nature and content of each sub database below.

in the above example. The peptides are also categorized in terms of their relative observed immunodominance. Antibodies host organism and isotype are recorded. The current B cell epitope archive contains 3,541 epitopes.

T Cell Epitopes
T cell epitopes are short peptides bound by major histocompatibility complexes (MHC) and subsequently recognized by T cells. Epitopes recognized by both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are included in the database. Such epitopes can be identified in many different ways. However, this diversity of measurement imposes a certain need for consistency, necessitating the requirement for recording a range of different experimental methods. The archive has expanded to include 4,158 entries. The entries contain the epitopes, ranging in length from 4 to 38 amino acids, peptide information, detailing the source, with links to Swiss-Prot and the corresponding MHC restriction data such as Serotype, Allele and Class. Additionally, the peptides are categorized in to groups such as Allergens, Bacterial, Cancer, Human, Viral and Self peptides.

Overview of the different search methods within AntiJen
. The example search is focused upon an MHC ligand. The MHC ligand data can be searched directly (A) from a link on the AntiJen homepage, a broad search and specific search is available. A search for the epitope AMALLRLPLV, has one hit (D), this leads to the entry (G). All of the other sub-databases can be searched in this manner from the homepage. The two other searches are more generalised. A Keyword search (B) carries out a broad search on the whole database, for the criteria – Bacteria. This search gives 139 hits (E) and all of the sub-database entries can be selected from this output. The final search method is a BLAST search (C). The peptide (or nucleotide) sequence is queried against a local protein database. The output (F) provides links to the sub-databases relative to the protein.

Future work
Future tasks in the development of AntiJen, fall into two principle categories: eliminating deficiencies, errors, and inconsistencies within the database and simultaneously reinforcing it by expanding its depth, breadth, and scope. We also need to monitor updates within external databases, so that any alterations are mirrored within the archive. Like all other such repositories, AntiJen is prone to both systematic and random errors within the data accumulation process. User feedback and our interactions with immunologists will hopefully address persisting errors. Deficiencies in our database include our current inability to encode chemically or post-translationally modified peptides, non-natural MHC mutants and non-amino acid peptidomimetic MHC ligands. Additionally, it would also be interesting to complement our existing data on TAP binding with information on antigen presentation pathways, such as proteasomal and cathepsin cleavage patterns. Moreover, the compilation of B cell or antibody epitope data is an area ripe for robust development. Linear and conformational B cell epitopes are very much larger in number than our current compilation, leaving us scope to greatly increase recorded epitopes.

Conclusion
The development of a database is always a work in progress. Not simply because the easily accessible literature is typically always increasing, but also because of the desire to capture as much of the existing, but hidden, literature, as possible. In the post-genomic era, the database has formed the bedrock and language of bioinformatics; increasingly databases are coming to underpin our modern understanding of biology as a whole. Traditionally, databases have arisen as a response to need, answering the individual and idiosyncratic questions posed by biologists. However, the history of bioinformatics databases has shown the extraordinarily diverse ways in which archived data can be used.

], and partly by a more altruistic desire to generate a useful, integrated database system with a quantitative focus. AntiJen has many potential uses throughout the immunological discipline, from immunoinformaticans to experimental immunologists and vaccinologists. By increasing the degree to which data is machine readable and web accessible, we open up new, and previously unthought-of, avenues for the bioinformatic exploration of immunological data.
