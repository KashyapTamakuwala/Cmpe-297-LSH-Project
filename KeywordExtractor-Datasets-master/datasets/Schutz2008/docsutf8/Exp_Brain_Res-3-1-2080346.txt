Anchoring, that is, a local reduction in kinematic (i.e., spatio-temporal) variability, is commonly observed in cyclical movements, often at or around reversal points. Two kinds of underpinnings of anchoring have been identified—visual and musculoskeletal—yet their relative contributions and interrelations are largely unknown. We conducted an experiment to delineate the effects of visual and musculoskeletal factors on anchoring behavior in visuo-motor tracking. Thirteen participants (reduced to 12 in the analyses) tracked a sinusoidally moving visual target signal by making flexion–extension movements about the wrist, while both visual (i.e., gaze direction) and musculoskeletal (i.e., wrist posture) factors were manipulated in a fully crossed (3 × 3) design. Anchoring was affected by both factors in the absence of any significant interactions, implying that their contributions were independent. When gaze was directed to one of the target turning points, spatial endpoint variability at this point was reduced, but not temporal endpoint variability. With the wrist in a flexed posture, spatial and temporal endpoint variability were both smaller for the flexion endpoint than for the extension endpoint, while the converse was true for tracking with the wrist extended. Differential anchoring effects were absent for a neutral wrist posture and when gaze was fixated in between the two target turning points. Detailed analyses of the tracking trajectories in terms of velocity profiles and Hooke’s portraits showed that the tracking dynamics were affected more by wrist posture than by gaze direction. The discussion focuses on the processes underlying the observed independent effects of gaze direction and wrist posture on anchoring as well as their implications for the notion of anchoring as a generic feature of sensorimotor coordination.

) concluded from the representation of 4-limb patterns as a single trajectory on a 3-D torus that the essential information for coordination is confined or localized to discrete regions in phase space. In several subsequent studies on rhythmic movement conducted from a dynamical systems perspective, anchor points or anchoring phenomena have been observed, discussed and even modeled. In order to motivate the purpose and design of the present study, it is necessary to highlight the various aspects of anchoring that have been identified so far in the literature.

The rack with armrest and manipulandum could be positioned in different orientations with respect to the LED bow, allowing manipulation of wrist posture (see below). Each rack orientation was calibrated to the LED bow to facilitate direct comparison of target and feedback signals as well as for offline comparison of target signal and potentiometer data (both expressed in °). Point-of-gaze was expressed in °, allowing for a comparison of point-of-gaze and the target signal. Eye-tracker data were synchronized with potentiometer and LED bow data.

Trials were presented in blocks with the three wrist postures providing the first level of blocking (3 × 15 trials) and gaze direction (3 × 5 trials) the next. The order of the wrist posture blocks was counterbalanced over participants (with each order being performed by two participants; full counterbalancing was possible because the data of one participant were discarded, see below). The gaze direction blocks within the wrist posture blocks were presented in random order. Prior to each wrist posture block, participants were invited to familiarize themselves with each new wrist posture through making self-paced wrist movements. The laser pointer provided direct feedback of the hand movement during both familiarization and experimental trials. Participants were instructed to move their hand in phase with the oscillating target signal as accurately as possible while directing their gaze to the instructed fixation point (left, center, or right). To facilitate trial initiation, the target signal always started at the attended area. All trials lasted 20 s (i.e., 36 cycles).

Pre-processing
Potentiometer data (hand movement) and LED coordinates (target) of the included trials were transformed into ° and low-pass filtered using a bi-directional second-order Butterworth filter (cut-off frequency: 15 Hz). The first five cycles of each trial were excluded from analysis to eliminate possible transient effects. From the remaining 31 cycles several dependent variables were calculated. Those variables related to tracking performance, anchoring, and global kinematics, respectively.

Discussion
In the present experiment we sought to systematically delineate the effects of visual and musculoskeletal factors on anchoring phenomena, that is, local reductions in kinematic variability, which may reflect “organizing centers” for perceptual-motor control. In particular, we investigated the relative contributions of gaze direction and wrist posture on both spatial and temporal anchoring in the performance of a rhythmic, unimanual visuo-motor tracking task. In addition, we examined the velocity profiles and Hooke’s portraits of the full tracking trajectories to gain insight into the relationship between the local anchoring phenomena and the global organization of the tracking movements. In the following, we first outline the main findings of both types of analysis before discussing their broader implications for the theoretical understanding of anchoring.
Effects on spatial and temporal anchoring 
2005
) also reported evidence for visual underpinnings in that anchoring was found to depend on gaze direction. Based on those findings we expected that systematic manipulations of gaze direction and wrist posture would have clearly discernable effects on anchoring, which was indeed the case.

), even though gaze direction and wrist posture were systematically manipulated only in the present study. Moreover, the current systematic variations of wrist posture also revealed that for the flexed wrist posture flexion endpoint variability was lower than extension endpoint variability.

, lower panels). Specifically, with the wrist in a flexed posture the variability in the timing of flexion excursions relative to the target was lower than that of extension excursions while the converse was true with the wrist extended. No differential effect in timing variability was observed for tracking with the wrist in a neutral posture nor for the three different gaze directions. These findings suggest that movements were actively timed or anchored on maximal flexion with the wrist in a flexed posture and on maximal extension with the wrist in an extended posture. In contrast, the absence of an effect of gaze direction on temporal anchoring may imply that gaze direction only affected the spatial accuracy of the tracking movements but not their timing.

). The fact that gaze direction affected only spatial anchoring and not temporal anchoring provided further support for the conclusion that the contributions of gaze direction and wrist posture to anchoring were independent.

Effects on global tracking behavior

 (viz. greater deviation from the straight line representing harmonic oscillation).
Those qualitative observations were reflected in significant differences in the duration, peak velocity and harmonicity of the flexion and extension phases of the movement as determined from the velocity profiles and Hooke’s portraits. Wrist posture strongly affected the global tracking behavior and led to marked differences between flexion and extension for wrist postures other than neutral. For the flexed (extended) wrist posture, the flexion (extension) phase lasted shorter, had higher peak velocity and was less harmonic than the extension (flexion) phase. Gaze direction also significantly affected movement duration and peak velocity of the flexion and extension half cycles, albeit to a much smaller degree. If gaze was directed to the left (right) target turning point, the duration of the flexion (extension) phase was shorter than that of the extension (flexion) phase, accompanied by higher flexion (extension) peak velocity. When gaze was fixated in between the two target turning points velocity profiles were symmetric. Tracking harmonicity was not significantly affected by gaze direction.

 suggests a graded modulation of those nonlinear conservative and dissipative components as a function of wrist posture and gaze direction, underscoring again that both factors had an additive rather than an interactive effect on the organization of tracking.

). Hence, this energy-saving mechanism may well be relevant for tracking with the wrist flexed or extended and underlie the conservative and dissipative terms identified in the Hooke’s portraits, as will be discussed further below.
The temporal anchoring analysis revealed that movements were actively timed or anchored on maximal flexion with the wrist in a flexed posture and on maximal extension with the wrist in an extended posture. In either case, movement durations were shorter (and peak velocities larger) towards the anchored endpoint. Following a similar line of reasoning, the observed deviation from harmonicity in the Hooke’s portraits for a flexed (extended) wrist posture suggests that flexion (extension) movements are actively steered to a specific point in the perceptual-motor workspace (i.e., the movement cycle is anchored on maximal flexion (extension)), while the extension (flexion) half cycle simply serves to bring the hand out again for the next flexion (extension), perhaps in part passively through the release of potential energy stored in the elastic tissues around the wrist. The observed local and global features of tracking are surely consistent with such an interpretation.

) submitted that anchor points contain critical task-specific information for organizing a cyclical act. The results of the present study suggested that the anchor points may also possess functional task-specific mechanical properties that can be utilized in the organization of the cyclical act (in our case, the possibility to store and release energy). Tracking was controlled in a (partly) discrete manner, with the actively controlled flexion (extension) phase apparently acting as a kind of biological escapement for fueling the potential energy capacity of the extensors (flexors).

Future studies should be conducted to reveal the precise contribution of “gaze anchoring” on endpoint variability during rhythmic tracking, for instance by comparing unimanual in-phase and antiphase tracking (without direct or extrinsic visual feedback of the moving hand) under fixed left, center, and right gaze directions.
