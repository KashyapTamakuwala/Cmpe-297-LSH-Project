Following recent advances in the analysis of centre-of-pressure (COP) recordings, we examined the structure of COP trajectories in ten children (nine in the analyses) with cerebral palsy (CP) and nine typically developing (TD) children while standing quietly with eyes open (EO) and eyes closed (EC) and with concurrent visual COP feedback (FB). In particular, we quantified COP trajectories in terms of both the amount and regularity of sway. We hypothesised that: (1) compared to TD children, CP children exhibit a greater amount of sway and more regular sway and (2) concurrent visual feedback (creating an external functional context for postural control, inducing a more external focus of attention) decreases both the amount of sway and sway regularity in TD and CP children alike, while closing the eyes has opposite effects. The data were largely in agreement with both hypotheses. Compared to TD children, the amount of sway tended to be larger in CP children, while sway was more regular. Furthermore, the presence of concurrent visual feedback resulted in less regular sway compared to the EO and EC conditions. This effect was less pronounced in the CP group where posturograms were most regular in the EO condition rather than in the EC condition, as in the control group. Nonetheless, we concluded that CP children might benefit from therapies involving postural tasks with an external functional context for postural control.

). The recent conceptual and methodological developments in the analysis of COP trajectories alluded to in the preceding provide an alternative approach for studying the consequences of concurrent visual feedback for postural control and thus of its potential for possible therapeutic applications.
Motivated by this combination of theoretical and practical considerations, the aim of the present study was (1) to compare postural sway fluctuations of children with CP with that of typically developing (TD) children and (2) to investigate the effect of visual information on postural sway in CP children and in TD children. For this purpose, the availability of visual information was manipulated relative to standing with eyes open (EO condition) by means of visual deprivation (standing with eyes closed, EC condition) and external provision of COP feedback (FB condition). Two kinds of measures were used to analyse the COP trajectories recorded during those conditions, the one scale-dependent and the other scale-independent. The conventional, scale-dependent measures pertained to the ‘amount of sway’, whereas the more recent scale-independent measures pertained to the ‘regularity of sway’ (see Methods section for details). We hypothesised that (1) compared to TD children, CP children exhibit a greater amount of sway and more regular sway and (2) concurrent visual feedback (providing a functional external context for postural control, creating a more external focus of attention) decreases both the amount of sway and sway regularity in TD and CP children alike, while closing the eyes (increasing task difficulty through deprivation of visual information, promoting a less automatic mode of postural control) has opposite effects.

Methods
Participants
Ten children with congenital hemiplegia or cerebral palsy (CP children; six boys, four girls; mean age = 7 years, range = 5–11 years), reduced to nine in the analyses (see below) and nine typically developing children (TD children; five boys, four girls; mean age = 8 years, range = 5–11 years) without known motor impairments or movement-related disorders volunteered to participate in the experiment. All children and their parents gave their informed consent prior to participation. The experiment was carried out in compliance with the Helsinki Declaration and was endorsed by the VU University Medical Centre Amsterdam.

Procedure and apparatus
1
 with their arms hanging relaxed alongside the body. Their feet were placed parallel to the anterior–posterior axis of the force plate and the distance between the feet corresponded to the width of the pelvis. Children wore their own shoes, including ankle-foot ortheses and/or insoles to correct for leg-length discrepancies.
Children participated in three conditions that were presented in random order: standing upright with eyes open (EO condition), standing upright with eyes closed (EC condition) and standing upright with visual COP feedback (FB condition). As explained, the FB condition was introduced to provide an external functional context for postural control, creating a more external focus of attention. To this end, a 2.5 m × 2.5 m vertical screen was placed in front of the child at a distance of 1.3 m. On this screen the force plate was depicted as a 40 cm × 40 cm square onto which the COP was projected as a red dot. The children were asked to keep this dot within the target area, which consisted of a 4 cm × 4 cm square. Deprivation of visual postural sway information was effectuated by blindfolding the children in the EC condition. Trial duration was 60 s. Participants performed each condition once, with the proviso that, as part of a separate study, five CP children performed each condition twice (the first trial was used for further analyses). Because in the latter set of recordings trial duration was 30 s, the first 3,000 samples of all trials were used in the analyses to avoid differences in the reliability of the dependent measures. One CP child did not want to be blindfolded and was therefore excluded from further analyses, which rendered the number of CP children equal to the number of control subjects.

Discussion
In the present study we compared posturograms of children with CP with those of TD children under three conditions. Across conditions, we expected the posturograms of CP children to reflect a greater amount of sway and more regular sway than those of TD children (Hypothesis 1). Furthermore, in line with the recently postulated relation between the amount of attention invested in posture and COP regularity, we expected that concurrent visual COP feedback, providing a functional external context for postural control leading to a more external focus of attention, would result in a decrease in both the amount of sway and sway regularity, whereas the EC condition, in which visual information is absent, would have opposite results (Hypothesis 2). The data were largely in agreement with both hypotheses, as will be discussed next. Furthermore, the finding that SEn estimates were significantly increased after time- and phase-randomisation of the original data ruled out the possibility that the regular or deterministic properties observed in the original data occurred by chance.

). In parallel, sample entropy increased with concurrent visual feedback compared to standing with eyes open and eyes closed. Thus, in spite of the fact that the ‘amount of sway’ did not change significantly over conditions, the observed changes in ‘regularity of sway’ were as expected: sway was more regular in the EC condition and less regular in the FB condition.

Conclusion
The findings of the present study indicate that postural control in CP children is deteriorated compared to TD children, most likely due to a slowed development of neural control mechanisms in CP children. Moreover, visual deprivation (EC condition) influenced sway characteristics differently in CP and TD children, testifying to the altered nature of postural control in CP children. In line with the proposed relation between the amount of attention invested in posture and COP regularity, we found in CP and TD children alike that, compared to the EO and EC condition, COP trajectories were less regular in the presence of visual COP feedback, corresponding to a functional context mediated external shift in the focus of attention. Future studies should examine the merits of adopting an external focus of attention to enhance postural control in CP children in training or therapy, for example by providing visual COP feedback leading to a posture specific functional task or by introducing an attention-demanding secondary cognitive task.
