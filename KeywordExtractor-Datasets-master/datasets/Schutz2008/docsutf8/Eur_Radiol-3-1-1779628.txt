With the advent of powerful gradient coil systems and high-resolution surface coils, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has recently extended its role in the staging of rectal cancer. MRI is superior to endorectal ultrasound, the most widely used staging modality in patients with rectal tumors, in that it visualizes not only the intestinal wall but also the surrounding pelvic anatomy. The crucial advantage of MRI is not that it enables exact T-staging but precise evaluation of the topographic relationship of a tumor to the mesorectal fascia. This fascia is the most important anatomic landmark for the feasibility of total mesorectal excision, which has evolved into the standard operative procedure for the resection of cancer located in the middle or lower third of the rectum. MRI is currently the only imaging modality that is highly accurate in predicting whether or not it is likely that a tumor-free margin can be achieved and thus provides important information for planning of an effective therapeutic strategy, especially in patients with advanced rectal cancer.

Therapeutic options
Surgery
The anatomic position of the rectum in the true pelvis and its vicinity to adjacent anatomy, in particular the sphincter muscles, poses a challenge for the surgeon regardless of the surgical technique used. Surgical treatment of rectal cancer is a difficult balancing act between minimizing the risk of local recurrence and the preservation of anorectal and genitourinary function.
Total mesorectal excision (TME)
9
] has considerably improved prognosis in patients with cancer located in the middle or lower third of the rectum. Using this operative technique, the rectum is resected together with all surrounding lymphatic pathways, lymph nodes, mesorectal fatty tissue, and the mesorectal fascia while the parietal pelvis fascia and the pelvic splanchnic nerves (nervi erigentes) are spared. The widespread introduction of TME has markedly reduced the rate of non-continence-preserving abdominoperineal operations for rectal cancer.
10
]. Techniques used for local excision are transanal surgical tumor removal and endoscopic microsurgical tumor ablation. Only a few patients are candidates for local excision (about 5%) and these must be selected with great care.

], 83% of the patients with a positive CRM had local tumor recurrence. Hence, the topographic relationship of the tumor to the mesorectal fascia that serves as a natural barrier and anatomic landmark for TME is the most important criterion in local tumor staging for therapeutic decision making.

] found an accuracy of 83% in a study of 41 patients. If one takes into account that four-row CT scanners were used in these studies, it is evident that further improvement is to be expected from state-of-the-art CT scanners with up to 64 detector rows that are already in use today. Hence, the role of MSCT in the local staging of rectal cancer remains to be defined. CT is superior to both EUS and MRI in that the scan typically covers the entire abdomen and pelvis and thus also allows evaluation of the liver, the most important target organ of hematogenic metastatic spread of rectal cancer.

MRI

]. MRI using endorectal coil systems is comparable to EUS in that it allows highly accurate differentiation of the layers of the intestinal wall. However, endorectal coils also have a number of disadvantages. As with EUS, the field of view (FOV) is rather small and only allows adequate evaluation of early stages of rectal cancer because the evaluation of surrounding pelvic anatomy is limited. In patients with advanced tumors, insertion of the coil system may be impossible or is very painful. Another disadvantage is the high cost of endorectal coils, which are usually disposable.
The advent of powerful gradient systems and, above all, the development of high-resolution phased array surface coil systems in recent years brought the breakthrough in the staging of rectal cancer by MRI. The use of these phased-array surface coils combines a very high spatial resolution with a large FOV that allows not only detailed evaluation of the intestinal wall but also depicts surrounding anatomy including the mesorectal fascia.
Imaging technique
50
].
At our department, we administer a spasmolytic agent (butylscopolamine) at a dose of 20–40 mg to prevent artifacts caused by peristalsis of the small intestine and to distend the sigmoid and rectum. The agent has a short half-life and is therefore injected intramuscularly immediately before MRI.
For efficient planning of the pulse sequences to be employed, the radiologist performing the examination should beforehand obtain information about the approximate tumor localization (distance from anocutaneous line in cm) from the referring surgeon and ask the patient about any previous surgery or diseases of the pelvic organs.
The patient is positioned comfortably on the back and a phased-array surface coil is placed on the pelvis in such a way that the lower edge of the coil comes to lie well below the pubic bone. The coil is kept in place with belts and the patient is then advanced head-first into the bore of the magnet.
51
52
].
Since differentiation with the T2-weighted sequences is based on the contrast between the high-signal-intensity mesorectal fatty tissue and the rather low signal intensity of the tumor, spectral fat suppression techniques are not needed. The duration of the MRI protocol as just outlined is about 25–30 min, including planning.

Conclusion
The advances that have been made in the treatment of rectal cancer in recent years and that have considerably improved the prognosis of affected patients rely on differentiated pretherapeutic tumor staging. Despite its known limitations in T-staging, MRI is currently the only imaging modality that enables highly accurate evaluation of the topographic relationship between lateral tumor extent and the mesorectal fascia and to thus make a prediction about the CRM. In this way it is possible to carefully select those patients who will benefit from neoadjuvant therapy and to avoid overtreatment or undertreatment.
