Sodium retention and edema are common features of nephrotic syndrome that are classically attributed to hypovolemia and activation of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system. However, numbers of clinical and experimental findings argue against this underfill theory. In this review we analyze data from the literature in both nephrotic patients and experimental models of nephrotic syndrome that converge to demonstrate that sodium retention is not related to the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone status and that fluid leakage from capillary to the interstitium does not result from an imbalance of Starling forces, but from changes of the intrinsic properties of the capillary endothelial filtration barrier. We also discuss how most recent findings on the cellular and molecular mechanisms of sodium retention has allowed the development of an efficient treatment of edema in nephrotic patients.

Introduction
Interstitial edema is a common clinical feature of nephrotic syndrome (NS). It is often massive (up to 30% of body weight) and constitutes a functional constraint, owing to locomotive restriction and eyelid shutting. Expansion of the interstitial compartment volume results from the combination of abnormal renal sodium retention and alterations of fluid transfer across capillary walls.

].These findings also exclude a possible role in sodium retention of promiscuous activation of the mineralo-corticoid receptor (MR) by glucocorticoid brought about by decreased 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (11β-HSD2). Indeed, use of dexamethasone instead of corticosterone for glucocorticoid replacement prevents MR activation, even in the presence of 11β-HSD2 inhibition. The lack of involvement of MR activation in sodium retention in nephrotic syndrome is consistent with the fact that nephrotic syndrome does not induce potassium secretion.
None of the known factors that control sodium reabsorption in the collecting duct accounts for sodium retention in PAN-nephrotic rats

 show the time of treatment. Brattleboro rats genetically lack vasopressin secretion. JB1, an inhibitor of IGF-1 receptors, was continuously administered via subcutaneous mini-pumps at a dose of 12 μg/100 g body wt per day, starting on day 3. The antagonist of AT1 receptor, irbesartan, was administered per os at a dose of 2 mg/100g body wt per day. Etanercept, a chimeric antibody directed against TNF receptor, was administered twice (days −1 and 2) at a dose of 0.2 mg/100g body wt. The inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase, L-NAME, was administered twice daily by gavage (0.5 mg/100 g body wt per 12 h) throughout the study. The antagonist of PPARγ, SR202, was given per os at a dose of 20 mg/100 g body wt. All controls were treated in parallel with the vehicle. Values are means ± SE from 4–5 rats



As a matter of fact, sodium retention in PAN nephrosis unlikely results from the presence of an abnormal blood concentration of any factor, since only the treated kidney displays increased sodium reabsorption in unilateral PAN-nephrotic rats. Rather, alterations in collecting duct function may be accounted for either by a direct effect of PAN on CCD or by the abnormal presence of an unidentified stimulatory factor in the luminal fluid that reaches the distal nephron. The presence of this factor may result from its abnormal filtration secondarily to the alteration of the glomerular filtration barrier (e.g., a high molecular weight protein), or from its generation in the proximal tubule secondarily to alteration of protein/peptide handling.
Na,K-ATPase is the primary target of sodium retention in PAN nephrosis

Therapeutic implications
Nephrotic edema results from the combination of renal sodium retention and increased capillary permeability. Although treatment of either of these two alterations would prevent edema, treatment of capillary permeability alone would lead to hypertension. Thus, treatments of edema must primarily target renal sodium retention.

Conclusion
Whatever their etiology, nephrotic syndromes are always associated with renal retention of sodium. Renal sodium retention results from enhanced sodium reabsorption along the connecting and cortical collecting ducts and from blunted responsiveness of medullary collecting ducts to the natriuretic response to atrial natriuretic peptide. Induction of de novo synthesis of Na,K-ATPase is the primary effector of increased sodium reabsorption. It is not accounted for by any circulating factor, in particular aldosterone, known to stimulate sodium reabsorption along the distal nephron. New research strategies will be required to identify the unknown regulatory pathway that is dysregulated in NS.
Sodium retention in NS does not lead to high blood pressure but leads to an asymmetric expansion of the interstitium, while the vascular volume remains unchanged in most patients. This asymmetry of extracellular volume expansion is accounted for by changes in the intrinsic properties of the endothelial capillary barriers, i.e., an increase in its hydraulic conductivity and permeability to proteins, rather than to an imbalance of Starling’s forces.

]. Curiously, in PAN-induced nephrosis, sodium retention precedes proteinuria, suggesting that it is not secondary to the glomerular dysfunction. It should be stressed, however, that microproteinuria may appear sooner and concomitantly with sodium retention.
