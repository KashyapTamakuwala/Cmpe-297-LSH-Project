 receptors on the cell membrane can be visualised via immunocytochemistry with a specific anti-HisG antibody. S1P-induced internalisation was concentration dependent and was quantified using a microplate reader, detecting either absorbance, a fluorescent or luminescent signal, depending on the antibodies used. Among those, the fluorescence detection method was the most convenient to use. The relative ease of this method makes it suitable to measure a large number of data points, e.g. to compare the potency and efficacy of receptor ligands.

 receptor. Because the HisG-tag is N-terminal, it is extracellular. Therefore, when immunocytochemistry is performed without permeabilisation, only membrane-bound, tagged receptors will be detected. This way, internalisation is quantified as a difference in membrane-fluorescence between unstimulated and agonist-stimulated cells.

 described a method where cells were plated onto 24 well tissue culture dishes. After stimulations with an agonist, incubations with first and second antibodies followed. Measurements were done after adding alkaline phosphatase substrate, resulting in a colorimetric reading. In this paper, we now describe the validation of a similar method by testing various antibody combinations and detection methods to quantify internalisation of N-terminal HisG-tagged receptors. This resulted in immunocytochemical method using a specific anti-HisG first antibody combined with a fluorescent second antibody (AlexaFluor® 488) as our preferred choice. The signal can either be visualised under the fluorescence microscope or measured in a fluorescence microplate reader. The latter results in quantitative measurement of the decrease in signal caused by receptor internalisation, in a direct, sensitive and fast way.

Western blot
Cells were washed and scraped in PBS, spun down and lysed in RIPA buffer with protease inhibitor. Protein concentration was determined using the BCA kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Ten micrograms of protein were loaded onto a 4–12% NuPAGE® Bis–Tris Gel. Electrophoresis was carried out at 200 V for 40 min in NuPAGE® MES running buffer. Protein was transferred to Invitrolon™ PVDF blotting membranes at 30 V for 1 h. The membrane was blocked for 1 h at room temperature in 50 mg/ml non-fat dry milk in PBS followed by overnight incubation at 4°C with a dilution of 1:5,000 for mouse anti-HisG. After washing with PBS-Tween (0.1%), the membrane was incubated with a 1:20,000 dilution of goat anti-mouse-HRP IgG at room temperature. Detection was done using BM Chemiluminescence Blotting Substrate and Hyperfilm ECL.

Immunocytochemistry
Cells (40,000 cells/well) were plated on day 1 in 96 wells black, clear bottom plates or eight well chamber slides. The next day, the medium was changed to serum-free medium. After incubation overnight, cells were stimulated with the indicated ligand in serum-free medium for 30 min at 37°C, unless otherwise indicated. The stimulation solutions were removed, and cells were fixed by applying 4% v/v formaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature. After washing three times with PBS, cells were incubated with the first antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were washed again three times with PBS and, if necessary, incubated with the second antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were washed three times with PBS followed by measurements on a Victor2 (Wallac, Perkin Elmer). The following antibody combinations were used: mouse anti-HisG 1:200 with AlexaFluor® 488 goat anti-mouse 1:500, mouse anti-HisG-HRP 1:200 and mouse anti-HisG 1:200 with goat anti-mouse-HRP 1:500. In case an HRP-bound antibody was used, either ABTS solution (50 μg/ml) or BM Chemiluminescence Blotting Substrate was added to generate an absorbance or luminescence signal, respectively. For the absorbance signal, a 405-nm filter was used; for the fluorescent signal, a 490-nm excitation and a 535-nm emission filter were used.

While our technique does not allow following internalisation in real time, the ability to process a large number of samples compensates for that by studying multiple time points. The only limitation to our method is the inability to measure internalisation of endogenous receptors. However, this would be possible when specific receptor antibodies are available, which is not yet the case for our model receptor.
In conclusion, we have validated a method to quantitatively measure receptor internalisation in which we use an N-terminal HisG-tag combined with immunocytochemistry. It proves to be sensitive enough to discriminate between different receptor ligands in a fast and non-radioactive way.
