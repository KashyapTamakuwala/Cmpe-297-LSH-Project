Here, we describe the results of the second genome-wide scan for primary VUR. Differently from previous studies and aiming to collect a homogeneous sample set, our patients were ascertained in a single geographic region. Our results suggest the presence of several novel loci for primary VUR, giving further evidence for the genetic heterogeneity of this disorder.

Informed consent from patients and family members (parents for their children) and approval from the Ethic Committee at Second University of Naples were obtained previously.

Laboratory analysis
Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood leukocytes by standard techniques and was sent from the Paediatrics Department of Second University of Naples to the Department of Clinical Genetics, Erasmus Medical Centre in Rotterdam. A systematic genome scan was performed using the ABI Prism MD-10 set (Applied Biosystems) consisting of 382 short-tandem-repeat polymorphisms markers (STRPs), average spaced 10 cM. Additional markers for further characterization of candidate regions were selected from the gender-average Marshfield genetic map. Information about marker order and distances were obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) physical map and Marshfield integrated genetic map. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products were resolved on an ABI3100 automated sequencer, and genotypes were analyzed using the GeneMapper software v.2.0 (Applied Biosystems).

] to investigate the statistical power of our sample set. An autosomal dominant mode of inheritance was assumed with a penetrance of 70%, a mutant allele frequency of 1%, and a phenocopy rate of 1%. The calculations were done under the assumption of genetic heterogeneity. Assuming 35% of unlinked families, a maximum total log of odds (LOD) score of 5.4 was obtained with a low average LOD of 1.58 [standard deviation (SD) = 1.26], after analyzing all eight pedigrees selected previously. Increasing the percentage of unlinked families to 50%, a maximum LOD score of 4.94 was observed (average 0.99, SD = 1.04). Families 1, 4, and 12 had the largest contribution to the total LOD score (LOD = 0.86, 1.04, and 1.62, respectively), followed by families 5, 7, and 13 (LOD = 0.57). Due to their small size, families 2 and 11 had less contribution to the final LOD (LOD = 0.29). Simulations were calculated in the replication group (11 families) after exclusion of five parent–child trios, giving a maximum LOD of 4.57 (average 1.49, SD = 1.07) and a maximum LOD of 4.85 (average 1.14, SD = 1.08), under assumption of 35% and 50% unlinked families, respectively. Family 25 with seven patients was the main contributor to the total LOD score (LOD = 1.47). Finally, simulations were performed in all 19 families (genome scan group and replication group) reaching a maximum LOD of 9.19 (average of 2.76, SD = 1.78) and a maximum LOD of 7.36 (average of 1.71, SD = 1.34), under assumption of 35% and 50% unlinked families, respectively.

] was used to compute multipoint parametric and nonparametric (or model-free) linkage analysis. As VUR may often disappear with age, all individuals in whom VUR, RN, or both were not clinically proven were classified (and analyzed) as “diagnosis unknown”. Thus, a conservative “affected-only” analysis was performed based on these criteria. Due to the uncertain pattern of inheritance, nonparametric analysis was computed. The rationale of a nonparametric analysis is that, among affected relatives, excess sharing of haplotypes identical by descent would be expected, irrespective of the mode of inheritance. The nonparametric linkage statistics examining all individuals simultaneously (NPL-all), is reported.
A parametric analysis was performed as well. An autosomal dominant mode of inheritance with reduced penetrance, as described above (power calculations), was used. Marker allele frequencies were calculated using all spouses (unrelated individuals) coming from the same geographic area. Due to the genetic heterogeneity of the disease, the genome scan data was analyzed, maximizing the heterogeneity LOD score (HLOD) with respect to the proportion of linked families (α). Nonparametric (NPL) and parametric (LOD) scores were calculated for each of the families, and then total NPL and HLOD scores were obtained.

A total of 78 primary VUR patients belonging to 25 pedigrees were identified (33 based on a positive VCUG/RNC, 18 based on detection of RN, 21 diagnosed as having both reflux and RN, and six with ESRF). During the course of the study, a new patient affected with RN was detected in family 1 and included in the second stage. Twenty-eight patients were males and 51 were females (ratio M/F = 0.57). The median age at diagnosis was 3.5 years (range 1 month–68 years). Among the 79 patients, 19 were treated surgically, and four out of six who developed ESRF underwent renal transplantation.

Discussion
This study reports the second genome-wide search for primary VUR. Our results suggest the existence of several loci mapping to chromosomes 1, 3, 4, and 22, further supporting the hypothesis that primary VUR is genetically heterogeneous.
We, as others, encountered several pitfalls when studying VUR. We observed clinical variability among and within families and the presence of obligate carriers (individuals who carry and transmit the disease allele but do not manifest any disease sign or symptom). Although the appropriate clinical investigations were performed in several apparently healthy individuals (carriers), no evidence of disease was found, indicating a reduced or age-dependent penetrance. As most of these individuals were recruited during their adulthood, we could not exclude an earlier disease condition that evolved to a spontaneous resolution. To overcome these problems, we first performed a careful clinical evaluation of patients and available relatives. All individuals older than 5 years of age with insufficient or no evidence of VUR were classified as diagnosis unknown, despite the consequent loss of power for the statistical analysis.

] to declare significant linkage. Therefore, some of the identified loci may represent false positive hits and should be interpreted with caution.
The complex disease etiology of primary VUR has shown to be difficult to disentangle. Genetic heterogeneity and lack of knowledge of the true genetic model for VUR are probably the main difficulties in the identification of the genetic etiology of VUR. Although genetic studies in VUR are still in an early phase, we can presume that primary VUR is likely a complex disorder, with a number of not fully penetrant genes causing most of the familiar cases. Finally, primary VUR could be caused by simultaneous gene-environment interactions.
In conclusion, our results show further evidence for the genetic heterogeneity in primary VUR. We will next focus on the refinement of the identified genomic regions and the sequence analysis of the candidate genes according to their tissutal expression and biological function. Replication of the results in additional families will be essential, first to confirm and eventually to evaluate the contribution of these loci to the pathogenesis of primary, nonsyndromic VUR.
