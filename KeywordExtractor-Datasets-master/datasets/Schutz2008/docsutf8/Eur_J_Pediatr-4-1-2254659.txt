Children with severe chronic hemolytic anemia or congenital erythroblastopenia are transfusion dependent. Long-term transfusion therapy prolongs life but results in a toxic accumulation of iron in the organs. The human body cannot actively eliminate excess iron. Therefore, the use of a chelating agent is required to promote excretion of iron. So far, iron chelation has been done by subcutaneous infusion of deferoxamine given over 10 h, 5–6 days per week. Compliance is poor and chelation often insufficient. Ferritin measurements and sometimes liver biopsies are used to evaluate the iron burden in the body. At the present time, new iron chelators that can be given orally are available. Furthermore, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) assessment of tissue iron is a noninvasive and highly reproducible method, which is able to quantitate organ iron burden. In conclusion, iron overload can be measured more accurately with noninvasive methods such as MRI. Deferasirox is a once-daily oral therapy for treating transfusional iron overload, which improves patient compliance and quality of life.

There are several methods of assessing body iron load. As 90% of excess iron is deposited in the liver, most techniques focus on measuring liver iron levels, and it is widely accepted that liver iron content (LIC) provides an accurate measure of whole-body iron concentration. The invasive nature of the liver biopsy means that other markers such as serum ferritin levels are frequently employed. Other approaches using biomagnetic susceptometry and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are also being assessed in order to identify an accurate, low-risk, and convenient approach to assessing patient iron status.
Ferritin
Serum ferritin is easily measured using a commercially available kit. A ferritin constantly below 2,500 mg/l has been shown to reduce the risk of cardiac complications, but a target value of 1,000 mg/l is recommended. Factors such as inflammation, ascorbate status, and hepatitis can affect serum ferritin levels. Therefore, results should be interpreted with caution and a trend in the evolution of serial measurements is a better index than day-to-day variation. In patients with transfusion-dependent diseases, chelation should be initiated after 10–20 blood transfusions or when ferritin level rises above 1,000 mg/l.

Deferoxamine mesylate (Desferal) is the current standard for iron chelation therapy. The long-term efficacy of this approach has been demonstrated, limiting organ damage and preventing premature death. Deferoxamine has a very short half-life in plasma (5–10 min). Therefore, deferoxamine is administered parenterally, either subcutaneously 8–12 h a day at least 5 days a week, or intravenously, through a Port-a-Cath for continuous infusion. Low compliance with the prolonged subcutaneous administration is the main reason of ineffective treatment. Toxic side effects such as auditory, ocular, and neurotoxic abnormalities are also drawbacks in the therapy.

]. Deferiprone and its iron complex are cleared from the plasma with a half-life of 47–134 min. Therefore, it should be taken three times a day. The major toxic side effects are agranulocytosis, musculoskeletal and joint pains, gastric intolerance, and zinc deficiency. Those side effects are considered to be reversible. The combination of deferoxamine and deferiprone is most effective when used in the following way: deferiprone (80–110 mg/kg per day) during the day and deferoxamine (40–60 mg/kg per day) at least 3 nights a week. No new toxic effects have been reported for the combination.

]. Its long half-life makes it suitable for once-daily oral administration. Efficacy at a dose of 20–30 mg/kg per day is at least equivalent to that of deferoxamine (≥35 mg/kg per day 5 days weekly) in a subgroup of patients with higher hepatic iron burdens. The most common toxic side effects are skin rash, increase in transaminases and creatinine, and gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. The skin rash and gastrointestinal symptoms tend to decrease spontaneously with time and an increase in creatinine may require a dose adjustment. The increase in transaminases is usually linked to an insufficient dose of deferasirox and an increase in the hepatic iron overload. A higher dose of deferasirox will result in an improvement in transaminases.


Discussion

]. MRI has emerged as the dominant technique by which to evaluate iron overload because of its sensitivity, reproducibility, and ability to image multiple organs in the body during a single imaging session.
