In this case report, we describe a patient with longstanding rheumatoid arthritis who developed tracheobronchomalacia with fatal outcome. Despite negative antemortem biopsies of abdominal fat and tongue, amyloid was found postmortem in the trachea and appeared to be associated with tracheobronchomalacia.

] described a prospective cohort study of patients with RA without clinical signs of kidney disease and amyloidosis of the kidney. At follow-up, the group of patients with amyloid deposition confined to the perivascular region continued to have little proteinuria and a good renal prognosis, compared to those with amyloid deposition in the glomeruli who developed rapidly deteriorating renal function. This patient, however, does show that the disease course in RA patients with perivascular amyloid deposition in the kidney is not benign and may be associated with fatal complications elsewhere.
