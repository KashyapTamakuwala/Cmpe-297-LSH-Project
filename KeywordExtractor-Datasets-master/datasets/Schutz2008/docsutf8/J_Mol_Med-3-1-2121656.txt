The brain demands oxygen and glucose to fulfill its roles as the master regulator of body functions as diverse as bladder control and creative thinking. Chemical and electrical transmission in the nervous system is rapidly disrupted in stroke as a result of hypoxia and hypoglycemia. Despite being highly evolved in its architecture, the human brain appears to utilize phylogenetically conserved homeostatic strategies to combat hypoxia and ischemia. Specifically, several converging lines of inquiry have demonstrated that the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF1-1) mediates the activation of a large cassette of genes involved in adaptation to hypoxia in surviving neurons after stroke. Accordingly, pharmacological or molecular approaches that engage hypoxic adaptation at the point of one of its sensors (e.g., inhibition of HIF prolyl 4 hydroxylases) leads to profound sparing of brain tissue and enhanced recovery of function. In this review, we discuss the potential mechanisms that could subserve protective and restorative effects of augmenting hypoxic adaptation in the brain. The strategy appears to involve HIF-dependent and HIF-independent pathways and more than 70 genes and proteins activated transcriptionally and post-transcriptionally that can act at cellular, local, and system levels to compensate for oxygen insufficiency. The breadth and depth of this homeostatic program offers a hopeful alternative to the current pessimism towards stroke therapeutics.

. It can also activate TRPM2/7 channels leading to further calcium dysregulation. Hypoxia is sensed by decreased activity of HIF prolyl 4 hydroxylases that can lead to activation genetic responses capable of compensating for the sentinel metabolic stress (decreased cerebral blood flow). Decrease HIF PHD activity can also prevent death via HIF-independent pathways. Acidosis and ROS can also combine with HIF regulated prodeath proteins to trigger cell death

 By extension, small molecules that engage homeostatic mechanisms designed to alleviate hypoxia/ischemia early or enhance their activation should tip the balance away from cell death and toward survival and repair. Such small molecules are currently being developed and represent a new generation of stroke therapies

]. Emerging data indicate that inhibition of each of the three of the HIF PHD isoforms (1–3) may lead to cell survival in the nervous system. Of note, inhibition of each isoform may enhance survival via distinct but mutually supportive pathways.

]. More recent studies indicate that molecular suppression of HIF PHD 1 alone can mimic this effect (Siddiq et al., unpublished observations). Interestingly, while HIF-1, HIF-2, and cAMP response element-binding protein are stabilized by PHD inhibition in neurons or astrocytes, the molecular deletion or inhibition of each of these three transcription factors fails to abrogate the protective effects of PHD inhibition suggesting that other, as yet unidentified, pathways are important in protection (Siddiq et al., unpublished observations). Studies are underway to clarify whether molecular deletion of PHD1 selectively in the CNS confers resistance to stroke in a HIF-independent manner.

]. As target (post-synaptic) derived trophic factors appear to be lost after stroke and result in cell death remote from the infarct site, HIF PHD3 inhibition may be a rational strategy for maintaining the viability of these neurons in evolving or stable stroke.

Adaptation to hypoxia-cell fate and beyond. Expression of HIF in neurons leads to the constitutive expression of proteins associated with cell death (BNIP3, NIX, and PUMA) and cell survival (VEGF, glycolytic enzymes, Epo, and p21 waf1/cip1). Similar prodeath gene expression is found in neurons exposed to hypoxia or hypoxia mimetics despite the absence of cell death. It appears the oxygen “starved” neurons have stepped to the edge of the cliff. If during the ensuing hours to days the neuron becomes acidotic or oxidized, then prodeath proteins such as BNIP3 undergo a conformational change, insertion into the mitochondrial membrane, release of apoptotic effectors, and death. By contrast, if the survival genes are effective in neutralizing the hypoxic stress (e.g., no acidosis or oxidative stress), then the death genes never get activated. Our studies indicate that antioxidants, short interfering RNAs to BNIP3 or inhibitors of the HIF prolyl 4 hydroxylases tip the balance toward survival (away from the cliff)




The model has some clear predictions. First, low molecular weight global inhibitors of the HIF prolyl 4 hydroxylases will be more effective at preventing injury and repairing damage after stroke than selective isoform inhibitors. These inhibitors will engage HIF-dependent and HIF-independent pathways at cellular, local, and systemic levels and ultimately alleviate the discrepancy in nutrient supply and demand. They can also (via mechanisms that are only beginning to be defined) divert HIF away from its tendencies as a prodeath transcription factor. The ability of single “drugs” to target an oligopoly of proteins (HIF PHD1–3) to affect a concerted program of neuroprotection involving more than 70 genes and larger number of proteins suggests a strategy for overcoming the heterogeneity inherent in stroke pathophysiology in the short term. While a significant amount of work needs to be done to adequately assess the viability of this strategy for human therapeutics, the notion of augmenting endogenous adaptive programs via HIF PHDs to thwart disease continues to gain currency.
