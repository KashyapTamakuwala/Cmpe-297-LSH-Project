Between 1982 and 2006, there were 89 distinct publications dealing with oral appliance therapy involving a total of 3,027 patients, which reported results of sleep studies performed with and without the appliance. These studies, which constitute a very heterogeneous group in terms of methodology and patient population, are reviewed and the results summarized. This review focused on the following outcomes: sleep apnea (i.e. reduction in the apnea/hypopnea index or respiratory disturbance index), ability of oral appliances to reduce snoring, effect of oral appliances on daytime function, comparison of oral appliances with other treatments (continuous positive airway pressure and surgery), side effects, dental changes (overbite and overjet), and long-term compliance. We found that the success rate, defined as the ability of the oral appliances to reduce apnea/hypopnea index to less than 10, is 54%. The response rate, defined as at least 50% reduction in the initial apnea/hypopnea index (although it still remained above 10), is 21%. When only the results of randomized, crossover, placebo-controlled studies are considered, the success and response rates are 50% and 14%, respectively. Snoring was reduced by 45%. In the studies comparing oral appliances to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or to uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP), an appliance reduced initial AHI by 42%, CPAP reduced it by 75%, and UPPP by 30%. The majority of patients prefer using oral appliance than CPAP. Use of oral appliances improves daytime function somewhat; the Epworth sleepiness score (ESS) dropped from 11.2 to 7.8 in 854 patients. A summary of the follow-up compliance data shows that at 30 months, 56–68% of patients continue to use oral appliance. Side effects are relatively minor but frequent. The most common ones are excessive salivation and teeth discomfort. Efficacy and side effects depend on the type of appliance, degree of protrusion, vertical opening, and other settings. We conclude that oral appliances, although not as effective as CPAP in reducing sleep apnea, snoring, and improving daytime function, have a definite role in the treatment of snoring and sleep apnea.

Introduction
Treatment of sleep-disordered breathing (i.e. snoring, upper airway resistance syndrome, sleep apnea syndrome) can be divided into four general categories. These include: (1) lifestyle modification, i.e. weight loss, cessation of evening alcohol ingestion, sleep position training, (2) upper airway surgery, (3) oral appliances, and (4) CPAP. Although the latter category provides the most reliable therapeutic modality and is the most widely used method to treat sleep-disordered breathing today—it is also the most cumbersome one. Many patients, particularly young non-apneic snorers, find it unappealing, difficult to tolerate, and unacceptable. The only other non-invasive alternative, which can produce favorable results within a short time, is oral appliances.

] surveyed 500 general dentists in the state of Indiana and found that 40% “knew little or nothing about oral appliances for treatment of obstructive sleep apnea”. Unarguably, the knowledge about oral appliances among dentists and physicians varies geographically, being higher in large urban centers, which provide more educational opportunities locally, but the results of the survey certainly indicate a need for more education in this area.
This review will summarize our current state of knowledge of the efficacy of oral appliances for the treatment of snoring and obstructive sleep apnea. We shall not limit this review to a simple summary of the effect of oral appliances on nocturnal respiration, but will also examine other aspects of this therapy, such as the reduction in symptoms, vascular consequences, side effects, and compliance. However, the main objective of this review will remain to be the examination of the current data dealing with the efficacy of oral appliance therapy for the treatment of snoring and sleep apnea.

Mechanism of action of oral appliances

]. This debate is partially fuelled by the fact that airway narrowing or even a complete occlusion is a normal physiological event during sleep. In patients with sleep apnea, this normal response is exaggerated. The question then becomes whether this exaggerated response is due to abnormal neuromuscular control superimposed on the otherwise anatomically normal airway, or is the airway anatomically narrower than normal without any abnormalities in the neuromuscular control. It is now an accepted fact that a combination of abnormal anatomy and physiology is necessary to produce pathological repetitive narrowing (or complete occlusion) of upper airway during sleep—i.e. sleep apnea.

Results of clinical trials

] resulting in the increased use of oral appliances for the treatment of snoring and sleep apnea. However, the emphasis on the type of appliances has changed. Tongue retaining devices are currently seldom used, being almost completely replaced by the mandibular advancement appliances. The latter are sometimes also called mandibular repositioners, protruders, devices, splints, prosthesis, etc.—but the common feature of all these appliances is their ability to adjust the degree of mandibular advancement to achieve resolution of snoring and sleep apnea.
In what follows, we shall summarize the results of clinical trials employing oral appliances for the treatment of sleep apnea and snoring. In addition, we shall review and summarize the information regarding changes in daytime function as a result of using the appliance, clinical and dental side effects, and compliance with treatment.

 contains the studies from the two extreme ends of the spectrum of scientific rigor. At the highest end of the spectrum there are prospective, randomized, crossover, controlled (either against placebo-appliance or another treatment modality) studies. At the lowest end of the spectrum are individual case reports. Some studies are prospective case series, but most studies are retrospective analysis of series of cases.

 form a very inhomogeneous group with respect to several variables: time of follow-up study, type of polysomnography, which respiratory variables measured, presentation of results, type of oral appliance used, missing data, etc. The time interval between the diagnostic and “with appliance” polysomnography varied from a few hours to a few months. In some studies, split polysomnography (i.e. diagnostic part followed by “with appliance” part) was carried out, while in others, the two sleep studies were separated by a couple of days to several months. In some investigations, formal in-hospital polysomnography was performed, while in others, only at-home monitoring of oxygen saturation was carried out. In some of the earliest investigations, only the apnea index (AI) was measured. Later investigations reported the oxygen desaturation index (number of times per hour of sleep that oxygen saturation falls by more the 4% from the baseline—ODI4). Recent investigations all reported either the apnea–hypopnea index (AHI) or the respiratory disturbance index (RDI). Most investigations presented only the mean values, rather than the individual data, and some presented only the median values. Oral appliances used by the investigators included tongue retaining devices, soft palate lifters, and fixed and variable mandibular advancement appliances. In the vast majority of investigations, the mandibular advancement appliance was used, less than ten investigations employed the TRD, and only one investigation used the soft palate lifter. In many investigations, not all patients who had a diagnostic sleep study also had a follow-up “with appliance” study.

Clearly, it is not possible to carry out a meta-analysis of these studies because of the differences in study design, data collection, statistical analysis and presentation of the data. Even the simple descriptive statistics based on the pooled data must be interpreted with caution due to the methodological differences listed above. To obtain the general information about the efficacy of oral appliances, we analyzed the results of individual investigations in several different ways, as follows.

] found that the titration protocol was not predictive of the response during chronic use. In this investigation, 9 out of 21 patients with OSA achieved reduction in AHI to less than 10 during titration. However, none of them demonstrated the same beneficial response during longer use of the appliance at home with the effective protrusion determined during the titration night. These results indicate that oral appliance titration to predict the amount of mandibular advancement required to reduce AHI to less than ten is still imprecise and must be used with caution when determining the appliance settings for home use. Nevertheless, the application of titration protocols is a new and important development in this field, which may improve the success of oral appliance therapy by identifying patients who are likely to respond to this treatment.

] carried out a questionnaire survey of 126 patients treated with oral appliances. There were 41 patients who had tried both CPAP and oral appliance; 71% preferred oral appliance, 19% preferred CPAP, and 10% were unsure. This study favors oral appliance.
We conclude therefore that CPAP is more effective than oral appliances in reducing AHI, but despite this, most patients prefer oral appliances, undoubtedly because they find them to be less cumbersome than CPAP.

Examination of the individual investigations reveals that when oral compliances are compared to each other, either two different appliances or the same appliance with different degrees of protrusion or opening—it is cleat that the efficacy (objective and subjective) is very much dependent on the type of appliance and the degree of advancement. This further emphasizes the point that oral appliance therapy should be carried out by a dentist with expertise in this field who is familiar with different types of appliances and can select the most appropriate one for the particular patient. There is no “best” appliance. The best one is that which is comfortable to the patient and achieves the desired efficacy.

Oral appliances for the treatment of snoring
Although everyone can recognize snoring, it proved to be a very elusive entity to measure objectively. One can define the sound properties (i.e. frequency spectrum and intensity), relationship to breathing (i.e. waxing and waning sound, generally during inspiration), and measure this sound during sleep. However, subjective recognition of sound, which satisfies some pre-defined “snoring” criteria as de facto snoring depends very much on the listener. This is contrary to the case of apneas or even hypopneas, whose definition is independent of any subjective perception. These difficulties with the definition of snoring are the reasons why objective measurement of sound is seldom a routine part of polysomnography. However, snoring is the cardinal symptom of sleep apnea. In fact, it is frequently the only reason why these patients come to the sleep clinic in the first place. Consequently, when polysomnography does not reveal sleep apnea in these patients, the physician still has to deal with their snoring. Unfortunately, this is often ignored by physicians.
The most frequent scenario is that a patient is referred to a sleep specialist because of snoring, polysomnography is carried out, no sleep apnea is found, the patient is reassured, advised to loose weight, stop smoking and drinking alcohol, embark on an exercise program, and discharged from the clinic. Sometimes this advice, dispensed in the form of preprinted sheets, is given also to non-obese non-smokers. Clearly, the patient leaves unhappy, the referring physician is dissatisfied with the help received from the specialist and nothing was accomplished to justify the expense incurred in the process of investigations. For apneic snorers, the problem is simpler because treatment with CPAP will abolish snoring.
Non-apneic snorers without daytime symptoms do not tolerate CPAP well. Many of them will agree to try it, but the majority will stop using it after a short time (generally a few weeks to a few months). Oral appliances therefore constitute an attractive alternative for the treatment of snoring. In fact, they were originally invented precisely for that reason.

Effect of oral appliances on daytime function
In assessing the effect of oral appliances on sleep apnea syndrome, it is not sufficient to focus only on the apnea/hypopnea index or snoring. We must also demonstrate the effect of this treatment on daytime function, which is almost always compromised in patients with sleep apnea and sometimes in non-apneic snorers also. There are several tools used to assess daytime function, but there is little consistency in using these tools in investigations involving oral appliances.

In fact, none of the studies demonstrated a significant improvement in all of the subjective outcomes studied. This is not surprising because almost all studies comparing placebo treatment with active treatment, no matter what it is, always demonstrate a significant placebo effect.

] compared the quality of life in two parallel groups of patients with sleep apnea 1 year after treatment with either oral appliance or UPPP. The ESS was not measured, but there was other extensive assessment of three quality of life dimensions (vitality, contentment and sleep). Both groups improved compared to the baseline. There was no difference in vitality and sleep dimensions between the two groups, but the UPPP group was more content than the oral appliance group.
The effect of oral appliances on daytime function was not studied as fully and extensively as for CPAP. For example, there are no studies comparing driving simulator performance in patients treated with oral appliance, no studies comparing multiple sleep latency or maintenance of wakefulness. Recognizing the limited nature of the data—the conclusion from all of the investigations taken as a group must be that oral appliances improve daytime function, although they are not necessarily superior or consistently preferred than other treatments such as CPAP and UPPP.

Effect of oral appliances on vascular disease
Numerous investigations examined the relationship between sleep apnea and vascular events, such as coronary artery disease, hypertension, and cerebro-vascular disease. Fewer, but still many investigations were carried out to examine the effect of the treatment of sleep apnea with CPAP on changes in these conditions.

] who measured blood pressure in 161 patients with sleep apnea before and after 60 days of treatment with oral appliance. There was a statistically significant drop in blood pressure from 132.0/82.1 to 127.5/79.2 mmHg. Regression analysis demonstrated weak, but significant correlation between the mean arterial and baseline blood pressures and the reduction in AHI. This area of investigation is still in its infancy, and undoubtedly, more results will be forthcoming in the future.
99
] carried out a single night, unattended, home sleep study in 17 patients with sleep apnea (mean AHI = 25) and congestive heart failure with periodic breathing before and after intervention with a mandibular advancement device. The authors found improvement in sleep apnea (mean AHI reduced from 25 to 15), but no improvement in periodic breathing or left ventricular ejection fraction after 6 months of treatment.
There is not enough evidence at the present time to draw any conclusions regarding the effect of oral appliance therapy on vascular disease. This remains a very interesting area of investigation. Given the differences in intra-thoracic pressure as a consequence of CPAP vs oral appliance, it is possible that results obtained with oral appliances therapy will be different from those obtained with positive pressure therapy.

The conclusion, based on the results of most studies, is that when oral appliances are properly constructed by the dentist with expertise in this area, they are relatively comfortable in the majority of patients.

Compliance
Compliance with oral appliances depends strictly on the balance between the perception of benefit and side effects. Most patients treated with oral appliances have relatively mild sleep apnea and relatively few daytime symptoms; the main reason for treatment was snoring. Consequently, the perception of benefit is generally that of the bed partner, whereas the side effects are experienced by the wearer of the appliance. This is why the assessment of compliance is a complex issue. In some cases, although the appliance is quite comfortable, the patient may stop wearing it if the bed partner is no longer present or no longer complains of snoring.

101
]. It is based on a mail survey of 544 patients, of whom 251 returned the questionnaire on the average of almost 6 years after the construction of the appliance. The majority of patients were fitted with MAAs, although some had TRDs. At the time of follow-up, 161 patients continued to use the appliance. Assuming “the worse case scenario” (i.e. all those who did not return the questionnaire were no longer using the appliance) the compliance rate is 161/544 = 30%, while in the “best case scenario” the compliance rate is 161/251 = 64%. Among those who used the appliance, 82% of bed partners were satisfied with this treatment; even among the non-users of appliances, 46% of bed partners were satisfied. The main reasons for discontinuing the use of the appliance were discomfort (44%) and perception of little or no benefit (34%).
Pooled data summarizing all 21 reviewed studies involving 3,107 patients, showed that at the end of 33 months, 56–68% of them continued to wear the appliance.

Conclusions
Oral appliances used to date constitute a relatively heterogeneous group of devices for the treatment of sleep apnea and non-apneic snoring. It is this heterogeneity, which partly accounts for the variability in their benefit and side effects. Another reason for variability is the diverse methodology employed in different studies. The evidence available at present indicates that oral appliances successfully “cure” mild-to-moderate sleep apnea in 40–50% of patients, and significantly improve it in additional 10–20%. They reduce, but do not eliminate snoring. Side effects are common, but are relatively minor. Provided that the appliances are constructed by qualified dentists, 50–70% of patients continue to use them for several years. Their effectiveness is inferior to CPAP. It is similar to surgical procedures, but these are invasive, (although not particularly dangerous) and irreversible. The effect of oral appliances on the vascular consequences of sleep apnea is not known.
124
125
]. The current review does not alter those conclusions. It simply illustrates the marked variability of individual responses to oral appliance therapy, and therefore the necessity to approach each patient on an individual basis. Patients with sleep apnea should be informed about all treatment options. In some cases, the decision is simple; after informing patients about all available options, a strong and clear recommendation can be given by the health care practitioner. In other cases, the decision regarding treatment is arrived at only after individual consideration of all the factors—urgency of clinical situation, reimbursement plan available to patient, risk factors and the patient’s ability or motivation to modify them, patient’s preferences, and a possibility of having a trial of treatment with oral appliance and CPAP. There are patients with severe sleep apnea successfully treated with oral appliances, just as there are non-apneic snorers with or without upper airway resistance syndrome, successfully treated with CPAP. The decision regarding treatment in each individual patient is best made by medical practitioners with experience in sleep medicine who are aware of all options, and who are preferably a part of a specialized sleep disorders center.
An important issue, not addressed in this review, is the underuse of oral appliances currently. This is due in part to the lack of qualified dentists working in this area and in part to reimbursement policies. At present, the majority of government-sponsored and private health care providers will cover (fully or partially) the cost of CPAP, whereas very few, if any, health care plans will cover the cost of oral appliances. Considering that this treatment approach is the only non-invasive alternative to CPAP, it is important to continue to lobby health care providers to enable this treatment for qualified patients.
