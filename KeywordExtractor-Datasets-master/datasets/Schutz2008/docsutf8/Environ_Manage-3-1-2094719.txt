Soil and water conservation (SWC) contests among farmer groups were organized in five rural villages in the Bolivian mountain valleys. The contests were aimed at quickly achieving widespread sustainable results. This article analyzes the effectiveness of these contests as an extension tool. Mixed results were obtained. In three villages, participation rates in the SWC activities introduced in the contests were still high even 2 years after project withdrawal. These were all villages where a solid foundation for sustainable development had been laid before the contests were held. Two years later, most families were still involved in maintenance of the SWC practices introduced in the contests, and many farmers had started to experiment with different soil management practices. However, replications of these SWC practices were not widespread, Conservation Leaders did not continue with their training activities, and the quality of maintenance of the practices was often not satisfactory. In order to become a more effective extension tool and achieve widespread impact, SWC contests must receive continued support by a catalyst agency. Moreover, other SWC contests should also be organized in which practices are not predefined. Given that SWC contests are a low-budget extension tool, local municipalities could become more actively involved.

Hence, strategies and accompanying methodologies and tools are needed that achieve sustainable results in a short time and on a widespread scale.

). Unlike other small-scale participatory experiences, the logical strategy not only aims at slowness but also at making haste (i.e., in finding participatory methodologies and tools that achieve sustainable widespread success in SWC). Scaling-up and integrating SWC in a future extension system at a national level is the ultimate objective. One of the logical strategy’s most innovative tools is conducting SWC contests among organized groups of farmers. The objective of this article is to analyze the effectiveness of these SWC contests as an extension tool. This is principally done by monitoring and evaluating farmers’ participation in maintaining and replicating SWC practices after execution of the contests. The results will be used to discuss possibilities of using SWC contests in an extension strategy at a national level.

In three of the research villages, the “experimental villages” (Tomoroco, Kaynakas, and Sirichaca), the logical strategy was developed and tried out over a period of 4 years. The other two villages were “validation villages” (Talahuanca and Patallajta); in these villages the strategy was validated for 2 years. The villages were carefully selected, in order to obtain a representative sample of villages for the north-Chuquisaca region. Therefore, geographical, climatic, cultural, and socioeconomic characteristics are different among the villages. Rainfall varies from 350 mm/year (in Tomoroco) to 750 mm/year (in Kaynakas). Sirichaca has more flat lands for potato production, whereas the other villages have steeper and more erosion-prone slopes.
SWC is a barely developed activity in this region. Since the colonial era, when farmers started using a combination of Spanish and traditional agricultural practices to maintain adequate production levels, practices have not changed much. As a consequence, once cultivable land began to be used more intensively, traditional conservation practices were no longer able to control erosion and maintain soil fertility. Most of the SWC practices currently found in the research villages are still based on traditional knowledge, but given their ineffectiveness in conserving soil and water, farmers have become increasingly sceptical about prospects for sustainable agriculture in their villages. Therefore, migration rates are high in most of the villages. Attempts of development agencies to promote improved SWC practices have not been successful, mainly because of failing intervention strategies and the lack of adequate extension tools.

Research Methodology
The SWC contests were conducted in the “experimental villages” in 2001, and in the “validation villages” in 2003. In each ‘‘experimental village’’ only one SWC contest, which focused on all physical SWC practices, was conducted; in the “validation villages” two SWC contests were conducted, focusing on two SWC practices each. During the SWC contests, the number of labor days invested per family was monitored for each SWC practice. Moreover, the rate of participation in the contests (i.e., percentage of families actively involved in SWC activities) was evaluated in each village.
2006
), this was not considered a variable. Hence, large families, as well as, for example, widows were included in the sample. Similarly, farmers from the higher economic stratum (with more land) as well as very poor small farmers were considered.
In the ex-post evaluation, the percentage of families actively involved in both maintenance and replications of SWC practices was assessed by means of a field survey. If at least one type of SWC practice was properly maintained, the family was considered to be actively involved in maintenance. If at least one SWC practice was replicated on other fields after the project’s withdrawal, the family was considered to be actively involved in replications. Similarly, the active usage of other (nonphysical) SWC practices was evaluated during the ex-post evaluation.
Finally, in order to obtain data concerning the popularity of the executed SWC practices, quality of maintenance of these practices was evaluated within the same sample of families. For each family an average score was given for the quality of maintenance of each type of SWC practice, ranging from very bad (or abandoned) to very good. Based on these scores, and in order to be able to compare the villages, average scores for each village were calculated.

The Need for More Effective Extension Tools

). In contrast to other developing countries, where low adoption rates forced extension agencies to apply more people-centered extension approaches, the governmental extension service in Bolivia simply disappeared. The research and extension component remained an independent foundation only for the study of potatoes. Currently, a demand-driven research and extension system (SIBTA, the Bolivian Agricultural Technology System) is in place that promotes innovative technologies in support of productive chains. Given the system’s focus on promoting regional cash-crops, (poor) subsistence farmers are largely excluded.

). With the prime objective of agricultural extension being to reach all farmers, this is a crucial constraint.

). Farmers conceptualized this interaction and holistic approach as “the human farm.”
Implementing such an integrated and farmer-based extension approach is urgently needed in Bolivia; only then can a wide-scale impact be achieved. Although municipalities have considerable budgets for rural development, they do not have the human capacity to provide this service, and they regard extension as a state responsibility. Hence, there is a need for (1) profound changes at institutional level to give priority to extension, and (2) effective extension tools that can be used in a farmer-based extension approach. SWC contests are an example of such a tool.

). The competitions are flexible enough to permit farmers to find their own solutions to their problems (i.e., to experiment and innovate). All farmers participate in the judging, which stimulates the sharing of knowledge and the adoption and improvement of the practices. The winning villages and families receive farm tools, seeds, and animals as prizes. Participation rates in the competitions are about 80% to 90%. The project has recently won the World Bank’s “Development Marketplace Competition” for innovative ideas in international development.
in Bolivia the practices being judged in a contest are specifically defined, while in Peru the contests have a more general character (e.g., soil conservation) and practices are not specified;

in Bolivia money is not involved (and prizes are in the form of goods), while in Peru farmers are responsible for contracting the trainers and cash prizes can be won.


Based on these experiences, SWC contests are undeniably a very promising tool for farmer-based extension strategies, and for achieving fast and widespread sustainable impact in natural resources management. In the following section we will focus on the SWC contests of the JGRC project.

SWC Contests in the JGRC Project

) are, therefore, taken into account (e.g., to use small-scale experimentation) to start slowly and small, to achieve early recognizable success and to limit the introduction of technology. The essential multiplier effect is provided by the SWC contests and farmer-to-farmer training.
In the next section we explain the SWC contests in more detail. In all the activities the project’s extension worker plays a crucial role. At the end of the section we also present the differences between the approach of the aforementioned two projects and the JGRC project.

Activities Preceding the SWC Contests
Preceding the SWC contests (i.e., during the laying of a solid foundation for sustainable development in a village), SWC activities start with a group of about 10 Conservation Leaders (CLs). CLs are chosen by the assembly, taking into account personal characteristics such as responsibility, honesty and willingness to innovate. They receive intensive training from the project’s extension worker, aiming at the generation of a progress-driven attitude and at conducting experiments on their fields. Experimentation focuses both on physical SWC practices (stone lines, diversion ditches, bench terraces, etc.) and agronomical soil management practices (more efficient manure use, composting, green manure, etc.). CLs are also stimulated to establish some test-sites for comparing with and without cases, with the objective of obtaining more visible results and making on-site comparisons. This might convince visiting farmers that the positive effects are indeed a result of the practices, and not of different physical conditions between their farm and the CLs’ farms. Apart from experimentation and providing demonstrations on their own farms, CLs also have many less tangible tasks such as mobilizing the villagers to become involved in development activities. They are thus both promoters and technicians. Finally, training of CLs in techniques for knowledge transfer is given before and during the farm visits.
Once a solid foundation is laid in the village and CLs are sufficiently trained, the group decides when the first SWC contest will be held and which practices will be executed. In the dry season, practices like stone lines and gully control measures are considered and in the wet season practices that require digging such as diversion ditches and bench terraces. The village is informed in the assembly and by distributing information leaflets. During a period of at least a few weeks, families have the opportunity to decide whether to participate in the contest. CLs have an active role in motivating their neighbors, and in starting to organize groups based on vicinity. Eventually, each CL should lead a group of five to eight families. During these weeks of group formation, possible conflicts must be resolved, especially between neighbors. Given that effective group collaboration is crucial for a successful SWC contest, group formation should be given the required time.

Execution and Evaluation of the SWC Contests
A contest generally deals with two SWC practices. In a later stage a certain contest can be repeated and/or more integrated contests can be considered, combining different practices. The first contest is the most important one, because it serves as a selection tool for distinguishing the interested families (those with a progress-driven attitude) from the others. In this first contest a subsidy is given – as an incentive to all participants – for the purchase of a set of tools that are essential to conduct SWC practices. Each family pays 20% of the original cost. Families that start participating in a later stage have no access to the subsidized tools, and should themselves catch up with the already executed practices.
Each SWC contest takes about one or two months. Twice a year a contest can be held; one in the dry season and the other one in the wet season. The criteria for evaluating the contests are clearly indicated before starting: (1) executed quantity, (2) quality of the work, (3) knowledge, and (4) group collaboration. Major emphasis is given to training and learning during the contests. An essential technique for conducting most of the SWC practices is the adequate handling of the A-frame, which is used for establishing the contour lines in a field. This is generally taught during the first contest.

 serves as a venue for group learning, problem solving and the promotion of equitability among farmers. SWC practices are mainly conducted on fields situated near the farmer’s homestead; later they can be replicated on other fields. The project’s extension worker regularly monitors group work, and assists the CLs in their training. In the beginning, CLs often encounter problems and feel uncertain; regular meetings help to solve this.
Once a contest has finished, each CL measures the quantity of practices executed by his or her group. The verification of this quantity, as well as the evaluation of quality and knowledge, is done by means of cross-visits with other CLs. Quality criteria are harmonized between CLs before starting the evaluation. Knowledge is evaluated by asking some practical questions. For these three criteria (quantity, quality and knowledge) scores of 1 (bad) to 3 (good) can be obtained. This is written down on evaluation sheets. Based on observations, the extension worker evaluates the fourth criterion: group collaboration and cohesion. All criteria are given the same weight-factor in the final calculation.

). The most recommendable rewards are seeds for green manure and vegetables, which contribute to more sustainable agriculture. Additionally, the winning groups also receive, for instance, potato, maize, or barley seeds, all in small quantities. These prizes are useful products and their value is small enough to avoid participating in the SWC contests for the wrong reason. In this respect, money or food must never be used as prizes.

Activities Succeeding the SWC Contests
Maintenance of the newly constructed practices is the first priority, and complementary vegetative and soil management practices are essential in order to achieve impact on soil productivity. Vegetative conservation practices (grasses, bushes, or trees) also strengthen most SWC practices and make them more sustainable. They require, however, controlled grazing and strict rules at village level that are respected by all villagers. Hence, only when such regulations are collectively agreed upon will vegetative practices be viable and will SWC practices work.

), a group of farmers interested in agroforestry is trained to become trainers in this topic. Through farmer-to-farmer training, technical knowledge regarding agroforestry practices can be spread to a large number of farmers. Similarly, other groups of farmers specialize in, for example, manure management (improved stables, manure storage and collection methods), composting or green manure practices.

, most families will have to do it on their own. The role of the CLs is to provide support whenever it is requested.

Differences with the MARENASS and SID Projects
The emphasis on training in specific SWC practices during each contest instead of leaving more space for experimentation. The reason: the SWC contests are foremost an extension tool, i.e., they aim at providing farmers with basic practical knowledge of some simple SWC alternatives. After the contests farmers experiment with innovations and will adapt and improve the practices.

The emphasis on laying a solid foundation for sustainable development before starting the SWC contests. The reason: only farmers with a progress-driven attitude will continue to experiment and innovate after the project’s withdrawal.

, and to contribute to better internal relations and knowledge exchange.

The subsidizing of tools to stimulate participation in the contests, but no (or insignificant) prizes for winning groups. The reason: not having the tools is often a major limitation for participating, but once farmers participate, they must become convinced by the result of their work and not by the prizes they can win.

 shows that quality of maintenance is bad to moderate in this village; earth bunds, which were heavily damaged during a high-intensity rain storm, were all abandoned. In neighboring Talahuanca, however, despite severe drought and similar damage to earth bunds, all participating families in the SWC contests are still actively involved in maintenance, except for earth bunds. The presence in Talahuanca of a solid foundation for sustainable development before starting the SWC contests explains the differences between both ‘validation’ villages. Maintenance of gully control measures was generally given little attention in all of the villages, although most people are of the opinion that these practices work very well.
2007a
). Stone lines and diversion ditches were mostly replicated and covered large areas of the agricultural land in both villages. The average investment in these villages in maintenance and replications of SWC practices was estimated to be 20 labor days per family during these two years (2001 to 2003).
2
 shows that in Tomoroco 78% of all families constructed replications of SWC practices in the subsequent two years; in the other villages this was much lower (about 25%). Stone lines, especially, were replicated, given their relatively low labor requirements. The differences between the villages are explained by the fact that Tomoroco has more potential land for constructing stone lines, while in Talahuanca and Kaynakas the most important fields had already been protected. Moreover, on the steeper slopes of Kaynakas, stone lines sometimes disturb land preparation. In this village bench terraces were found more useful, but their replication requires higher investments. Replications of stone lines were found in only one village outside the project area, near Tomoroco..
Hence, the SWC contests have achieved mixed results in the five villages. They were effective in three villages: Tomoroco, Kaynakas and Talahuanca. The most positive outcome is that in these villages (on average) more than 80% of the families are currently involved in one way or another in SWC activities, and this was achieved without using incentive schemes or cash prizes. Most villagers also consider the executed SWC practices useful, and more than half of the farmers plan to replicate more measures in the near future. The three villages have in common that they all have solid foundations for sustainable development, which were laid before the SWC contests were conducted (in the first Phase of the logical strategy). This has triggered a renewed interest in alternatives to improve living conditions, including better soil management. The most negative outcomes are that in two of these villages (Kaynakas and Talahuanca) replication rates are currently very low, and in all villages CLs are no longer active as trainers. It seems that the dynamics of the process came to a halt after the project’s withdrawal. Some farmers cautiously experiment and replicate SWC practices, but most of them only maintain existing practices and wait for tangible results before investing in new ones. Similarly, the CLs find themselves in a vacuum; they are rarely asked for advice, and there is no common objective to keep the CLs’ groups active. The catalyst of the process, the project, is no longer there. The CLs were expected to fulfill this motivating role after the project’s withdrawal, but this has not happened.

). Given that SWC contests are a low-budget extension tool, they can be easily organized by municipalities and local NGOs, for example. However, despite the involvement of local leaders during the SWC contests, the active involvement of many extension workers is needed, especially when larger areas are to be covered in order to achieve a wide-scale impact. This can be a major limitation for local institutions; policies at the macro-level that enable the implementation of a farmer-based extension approach are therefore required. Earlier in this paper we already mentioned that in Bolivia profound changes at institutional level are required that give priority to extension. Only when such changes are made can SWC contests become an effective extension tool “to make haste slowly.”

Conclusions
1991
2005
), the JGRC project used this innovative tool in five rural Bolivian villages to put “making haste slowly” into practice. Mixed results were achieved with SWC contests between farmer groups. On the one hand, in villages where a solid foundation for sustainable development had already been laid, participation rates in the SWC contests were high. Most farmers were still involved in SWC activities even two years after project withdrawal, without receiving any incentive. In these villages large areas are currently protected with physical SWC practices and farmers have also started to experiment with other soil management practices. On the other hand, in the same villages the renewed system of collaboration focused on SWC was lost when the project withdrew, and Conservation Leaders did not continue with their training activities. Despite the visible widespread impact of the contests, sustainability is thus not yet assured. Farmers easily become disillusioned and unmotivated in the absence of a catalyst to keep the process of SWC contests and farmer-to-farmer training going. Moreover, tangible results such as higher soil productivity take a long time to appear. Farmers are opportunistic; in poor regions like the Bolivian mountain valleys, especially, they will grasp any opportunity to increase income.
Two recommendations were given in this paper to make SWC contests more effective in an extension strategy. First, in addition to the contests described here, other SWC contests should be organized in which practices are not predefined; this will stimulate peoples’ creativity in developing adaptations of existing practices. Second, commitment is required from local institutions to support SWC contests as an extension tool; only then can Conservation Leaders continue their activities, and can a widespread impact be achieved. Given the responsibility of Bolivian municipalities for rural development, they must be the first to become actively involved in extension. However, steering and support with adequate strategies from departmental and state institutions is indispensable; this will motivate municipalities to take natural resources conservation and rural development more seriously. Without such support, any attempt to spread SWC practices via participatory extension methodologies – such as farmer contests – will likely fail; no matter how logical and well-designed the strategy may be.
