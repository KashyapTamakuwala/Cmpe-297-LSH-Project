). This paper provides a summary of current knowledge and information on recognition and prevention of an alcohol-exposed pregnancy, including overall alcohol exposure burden among women of child-bearing age, diagnostic criteria for fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), and recommendations for screening, assessment and interventions to reduce alcohol exposed pregnancies.

Primary healthcare providers can play a pivotal role in identifying women of reproductive age (during pregnancy and before pregnancy occurs) who are at high risk for an alcohol-exposed pregnancy and providing them with advice, counseling, and referral as appropriate. This strategy has widespread support among professional organizations including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologist (ACOG), and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), as well the U.S. Office of the Surgeon General, and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

]. Project CHOICES was conducted in diverse sub-populations of women determined to have higher proportions of individuals at risk for an alcohol-exposed pregnancy. Compared to the overall estimated 2% of childbearing women at risk for an alcohol-exposed pregnancy, the Project CHOICES intervention settings (e.g. a jail, alcohol and drug treatment facilities, and primary care clinics) had an overall rate of 12.5% of women at risk for an alcohol-exposed pregnancy. A unique aspect of the intervention is that it focused not only on reducing risk drinking, but also addressed pregnancy postponement as a route for avoiding an alcohol-exposed pregnancy. The intervention consisted of 4 brief motivational interventions sessions and 1 consultation visit to a family planning provider. All participants were at risk for an alcohol-exposed pregnancy in that they were sexually active, fertile, risky drinkers and not taking effective measures to avoid pregnancy. At the 6 month follow-up assessment, 68.5% were at reduced risk because they had either changed their risk drinking, instituted effective contraception, or both. Subsequently, the Project CHOICES Research Group completed a randomized controlled trail to test the efficacy of the intervention with a report of the study findings currently underway.

. This advisory drew attention to the continuing problem of FASD and the continuing high rates of alcohol use, including binge drinking, among childbearing aged women in the U. S. The impact of the advisory has provided support for those seeking to inform and educate the public healthcare system overall to this important public health concern.

]. Referral to needed social services should complement health services in order to achieve maximum benefits of primary care-based attempts to reduce alcohol-exposed pregnancies. Given the levels of alcohol use among childbearing aged women, primary care-based individual level assessment and intervention continues to remain a critical prevention strategy for reducing alcohol-exposed pregnancies.
