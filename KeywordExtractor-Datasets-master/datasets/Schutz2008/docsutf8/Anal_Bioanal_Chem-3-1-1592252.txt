Characterizing the biological effects of metabolic transformations (or biotransformation) is one of the key steps in developing safe and effective pharmaceuticals. Sulfate conjugation, one of the major phase II biotransformations, is the focus of this study. While this biotransformation typically facilitates excretion of metabolites by making the compounds more water soluble, sulfation may also lead to bioactivation, producing carcinogenic products. The end result, excretion or bioactivation, depends on the structural features of the sulfation sites, so obtaining the structure of the sulfated metabolites is critically important. We describe herein a very simple, high-throughput procedure for using mass spectrometry to identify the structure—and thus the biological fate—of sulfated metabolites. We have chemically synthesized and analyzed libraries of compounds representing all the biologically relevant types of sulfation products, and using the mass spectral data, the structural features present in these analytes can be reliably determined, with a 97% success rate. This work represents the first example of a high-throughput analysis that can identify the structure of sulfated metabolites and predict their biological effects.

], which modifies the structural feature of the potential sulfation site. Since these new sites are formed in vivo, characterizing the biological effect of their sulfation can be problematic. It is thus essential to develop a method that can characterize the sulfation sites of unknown sulfated metabolites. With this information, the biological effect of sulfation can be estimated, and the properties of sulfated metabolites can be characterized.

In order to facilitate the identification of sulfation sites in pharmaceuticals, we developed a mass spectrometry-based protocol that differentiates between the biologically relevant sulfation sites. After completing the studies on several classes of sulfated products, a set of rules was developed to predict the sulfation sites. With these prediction rules, structural feature of sulfation sites can be determined by detecting MS/MS fragmentation pathways of their corresponding sulfated products. With the structural information of sulfation sites, the two key different biological effects of sulfation, “detoxification” and “bioactivation”, can be differentiated, based on literature precedence that links the type of sulfation to its biological fate. Based on that information, relevant properties of sulfated products can be estimated.

Mass spectrometry
 The mass spectra were recorded using a Quattro Ultima (Waters Corp., Milford, MA) triple quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray ionization source. Data was acquired in the negative ion mode using a capillary voltage of 2.80 kV and a cone voltage was 45 V. The source temperature and desolvation gas temperature were 80 and 150 °C, respectively. Argon is used as the collision gas, and the pressure in collision cell is 1.7E(−3) mbar. The collision energy applied in MS/MS for all the samples was 35 eV.

Sulfation of other sites, like phenols, aliphatic alcohols or amines, will cause other characteristic ions to appear in MS/MS data. Therefore, the sulfation sites can be determined by rule 1, 3 or 4. In these cases, sulfation facilitates detoxification.

Conclusion
A method was developed to determine the structural features of sulfation sites, by detecting the characteristic fragmentation pathway of the corresponding sulfated products in (-) ESI-MS/MS. By summarizing MS/MS data from five different types of sulfated products originating from different sulfation sites, their characteristic fragmentation pathways and characteristic ions were determined. Based on this information, a set of prediction rules was developed to transfer information about the fragmentation pathway of sulfated products to the structural features of the sulfation site. As a result, the proposed prediction rules can be applied in drug metabolite profiling to characterize sulfation sites, to further estimate the biological effect of sulfation, and to evaluate relevant properties of sulfated metabolites.
