The aim of this study was to explore the influence of viscosity on pharyngeal residue in normal healthy volunteers. Scintigraphy was used to measure pharyngeal residue in 11 healthy volunteers after swallowing three different substances (age = 20.2–48.3 years). The first substance was a 10-ml solution of tap water with 0.5% xanthan with a viscosity of 4500 mPa s, comparable to a yogurt drink. The second and third substances were a 0.75% xanthan and a 1.00% xanthan solution, with viscosities of 10,500 and 21,000 mPa s, comparable to low-fat yogurt and 3% fat yogurt, respectively. Tap water was used as the control substance. Mean pharyngeal residue after swallowing tap water was 2.3% (SD = 1.2) of the initial volume in the oral cavity. Pharyngeal residue after swallowing 0.5% xanthan solution was 1.8% (SD = 0.8), after swallowing 0.75% xanthan solution 2.6% (SD = 2.2), and after swallowing 1.00% xanthan solution 2.8% (SD = 1.7). No significant correlation between increase of viscosity and pharyngeal residue was found. In healthy persons viscosity does not seem to be a significant parameter for pharyngeal residue for boluses with viscosities ranging from tap water to solutions having a viscosity comparable to 3% fat yogurt.

] studied the influence of bolus volume on pharyngeal residue. All these studies examined different parameters of swallowing and found different outcomes. The aim of this study was to explore the influence of viscosity on pharyngeal residue in normal healthy volunteers, where our hypothesis was that swallowing a more viscous product would result in more pharyngeal residue in healthy volunteers.
Methods
Volunteers
Eleven healthy volunteers (9 female, 2 male, mean age = 29.1 years, standard deviation [SD] = 8.9), recruited by public advertisement, were invited to participate. All volunteers reported no history of swallowing problems. All volunteers gave written informed consent to participate in the study, which was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the Academic Medical Center of the University of Amsterdam.

Data Collection
For this study a gamma camera (Orbiter, Siemens Medical Systems, Germany) was fitted with a low-energy all-purpose collimator. A dynamic acquisition using 0.25-s frames was performed for 30 s. Data were acquired and processed on a Hermes workstation (Nuclear Diagnostics, Sweden). Volunteers were asked to sit in front of the gamma camera and hold their right cheek against the collimator. The oral cavity was placed in the middle of the field-of-view. When the volunteer was placed in the right position, 10 ml of one of the solutions was emptied in the mouth of the volunteer with a syringe. Volunteers were instructed to hold the bolus in their mouth and swallow on command. They were specifically instructed to swallow the whole bolus in one swallow and to breath through the mouth to inhibit a second swallow. Three cobalt markers were placed on the skin of the volunteers using a pen pointer: one on the mastoid bone, one on the hyoid bone, and one underneath the thyroid cartilage. The exact placement for the marker was found by palpation of the head and neck.

Tc colloid. After recording the swallow for 30 s, the volunteers were asked to rinse their mouth with unlabeled tap water and to swallow 200 ml unlabeled tap water to wash away any residue from the previous recording. The second recording was done with 10 ml of the 0.5% xanthan solution, the third with the 0.75% xanthan, and the last with the 1.00% xanthan. Between recordings the volunteers were instructed to rinse their mouth and swallow 200 ml unlabeled tap water to clear any possible residue. Each volunteer swallowed a consistency labeled with a dose of 13 MBq four times, for a total of 52 MBq, which is equal to a radiation dose of less than 1 milliSievert (mSv). According to the ICRP62 guidelines, this is a minor radiation dose (category IIa).

Statistical Analysis
The calculated percentages of pharyngeal residue were transferred to SPSS v12.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) for further analysis. Distribution of the percentages was formally tested with the Kolmogorov–Smirnoff test for normality and was not found to be normally distributed. To explore differences in median percentages of pharyngeal residues of the three xanthan solutions to the reference (tap water) on a group level, a nonparametric (Friedman) test was used. All statistical tests were two-tailed and differences were evaluated at the 5% level of significance.


Results
The mean pharyngeal residue after swallowing tap water was 2.3% (SD = 1.2; range = 1.1%–4.5%) of the initial volume in the oral cavity. The percentage of pharyngeal residue after swallowing the 0.5% xanthan solution was 1.8% (SD = 0.8; range = 0.9%–2.8%), after swallowing the 0.75% xanthan solution the residue was 2.6% (SD = 2.2; range = 0.7%–8.1%), and after swallowing the 1.00% xanthan solution the pharyngeal residue was 2.8% (SD = 1.7; range = 1.2%–6.4%).

Discussion
Our study attempted to investigate the correlations between viscosity and pharyngeal residue in healthy volunteers; we did not find evidence for a positive correlation between an increase of viscosity and an increase in pharyngeal residue.
12
] established that bolus volume does not influence pharyngeal residue, allowing extrapolation of our findings to other volumes, only one bolus volume was used in this study. It might be suggested that our volunteers drank 200 ml tap water after the first labeled bolus and thus the mucosa of the pharynx was relatively dry before the first estimation of pharyngeal residue. Because the larger proportion of our volunteers had drunk coffee, tea, or water in the last hour before the study, differences in dryness of the pharyngeal mucosa is not considered a confounder.
Only one bolus per viscosity was used, therefore no data on intrasubject differences could be provided. If multiple boluses per viscosity had been used in this study, the radiation exposure for our volunteers would have been much higher. Because none of the volunteers had swallowing disorders and all were used to swallowing tap water and yogurt, any adaptation in swallowing during the study to the circumstances during data collection or intrasubject differences can be considered negligible.
13
] examined with manometry the influence of increased viscosity on pharyngeal pressures. It was concluded that an increased bolus viscosity led to increased amplitude of the bolus wave and clearing contractions within the pharynx. The increase in contraction of the pharyngeal muscles supports our findings of equivalent percentages of residue for the different viscosities.

Tc. The mean pharyngeal residue was found to be 4.0% (standard error [SE] = 0.5) for tap water and 10.5% (SE = 0.1) for a substance with a viscosity of 1070 mPa s.

] a Brookfield Viscometer type RVT was used, which is more suitable for measuring the viscosity of low-viscosity products like milk. In our study we used a Brookfield Viscometer type LVT, which is more suitable for high-viscosity substances, making an adequate comparison between measured viscosities of the two studies not possible.

] (2.5%), where measurements were made in a right lateral position, one might conclude that the influence of head rotation in our study cannot be seen as a confounding factor on the outcome.

Conclusion
In 11 healthy volunteers, mean pharyngeal residue after swallowing tap water was 2.3% (SD = 1.2) of the initial volume in the oral cavity. The percentage of pharyngeal residue after swallowing 0.5% xanthan solution was 1.8% (SD = 0.8), after swallowing 0.75% xanthan solution the residue was 2.6% (SD = 2.2), and after swallowing 1.00% xanthan solution the residue was 2.8% (SD = 1.7). Our data do not show a significant increase in pharyngeal residue in healthy volunteers as a result of an increasing viscosity of viscous solutions, ranging from tap water to full-fat yogurt. Although some trends may be seen, (confounding) factors other than viscosity may play a role in the build up of pharyngeal residue.
