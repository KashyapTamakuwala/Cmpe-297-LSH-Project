Background
We studied the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and efficacy of oxaliplatin added to capecitabine and radiotherapy (Capox-RT) as neoadjuvant therapy for rectal cancer.

Methods
2
 twice daily (days 1–14, 25–38) added to RT with 50.4 Gy and surgery after 6–8 weeks. The MTD, determined during phase I, was used in the subsequent phase II, in which R0 resection rate (a negative circumferential resection margin) was the primary end point.

Results
2
 was established as MTD. In phase II, the main toxicity was grade III diarrhea (18%). All patients underwent surgery, and 20 patients had a resectable tumor. An R0 was achieved in 17/21 patients, downstaging to T0-2 in 7/21 and a pCR in 2/21.

Conclusion
Combination of Capox-RT has an acceptable acute toxicity profile and a high R0 resection rate of 81% in locally advanced rectal cancer. However the pCR rate was low.

 Incorporation of those drugs in combined treatment strategies could substantially improve the results obtained with bolus 5FU alone in downstaging and R0 resection rates in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer.
We investigated the combination of capecitabine and oxaliplatin given concomitantly with radiotherapy in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer. The optimal dose of oxaliplatin was first established in a phase I study, and in the following phase II study the efficacy of this regimen was tested.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Objectives
The objective of the phase I study was to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of oxaliplatin in combination with a fixed dose of capecitabine and radiotherapy, and the objective of the phase II study was to determine the R0 resection rate and pathological complete response rate (pCR).

Eligibility Criteria
9
9
/L, creatinin clearance > 50 mL/min, bilirubin < 1.5 times the upper limit of the normal range (ULN), and written informed consent. Patients with reproductive potential should use adequate contraceptive measures. Patients were excluded in case of prior chemotherapy and/or pelvic radiotherapy, acute bowel obstruction without colostomy, uncontrolled ischemic heart disease, peripheral neuropathy, or any uncontrolled serious systemic disease. The protocol was approved by the local ethics committees of all four participating hospitals. The study was performed within the framework of the Dutch Colorectal Cancer Group (DCCG).


TREATMENT
Radiotherapy
All patients received radiation delivered by an isocentric three- or four-field technique, using a linear accelerator of at least 10 MV. The patients were treated in either supine or prone position with a full bladder. The radiation field extended superiorly to the L5/S1 junction and covered inferiorly the obturator foramina. The minimal inferior border extended 4–5 cm below the tumor. In case the tumor was located in the lower third of the rectum, the perineum was encompassed in the treatment field. The width of the AP-PA portals had to cover the lateral pelvic inlet with a margin of 1.5 cm. The entire sacrum was included with a dorsal margin of 1.5 cm. Anteriorly, the lateral fields had to encompass the tumor as determined by barium enema (optional) and pelvic CT scan. If there was clinical evidence of involvement of the bladder, the prostate, the cervix or the uterine body, not only the internal iliac nodes but also the external iliac nodes were included in the radiation field. Computerized dosimetry was routinely performed. Irradiation was delivered 5 days per week at a dose of 1.8 Gy/day to a total dose of 45 Gy with a boost to the tumor in 3 fractions of 1.8 Gy to a total of 50.4 Gy.

Chemotherapy

 on days 1–14 and 25–38.

. Each dose level was to be administered to at least three patients. If a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was observed in ≥1 patient, a total of 6 patients had to be treated at that dose level. The maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) was defined as the level at which ≤2 out of 6 patients experienced DLTs without compromizing radiotherapy and surgery and was the recommended dose in the phase II study.

Surgery

21
 These principles include sharp dissection under direct vision following the lipoma-like surface of the mesorectum. Proximal transection of the inferior mesenteric artery was in general performed distal to the collateral between the left colic artery and branches of the sigmoid artery. Anterior dissection in male patients was carried out in front of Denonvilliers’ fascia. If tumor extended into the prostate a total exenteration was performed. In female patients, resection of the posterior vaginal wall was performed if necessary. A distal mesorectal margin of 2 cm was considered adequate if bowel continuity was to be restored.

Pathology
7
 and a margin of <1 mm from the primary tumor to the endopelvic fascia is considered positive.

Statistics
Twenty patients were to be included at the MTD to detect with a power of 80% a R0 resectability rate of >80% (with a 95% CI of 56–94%).

Monitoring and Management During Treatment

/L, respectively, before start of the next treatment cycle with oxaliplatin after a maximum delay of one week; diarrhea grade > 2; oral mucositis grade >1; skin toxicity grade > 2 before start of next treatment cycle with capecitabine, despite a delay of dosing for 1 week; neurosensory toxicity grade > 2 despite a delay in dosing for 1 week; occurrence of any grade 4 toxicity; and any event that would compromise the administration of radiotherapy.

Surgery
TME surgery was performed after a median of 47 days (range 4–8 weeks range in days) following the completion of chemoradiation. Mean hospitalization time was 14 days (range 9–95; 70% < 21 days). The main surgical complications were: major bleeding (1), rectal perforation (1), ureter lesion (1). Postsurgery treatment related complications were seen in 12 patients with mild wound infections (6), wound dehiscences (2), (sub)ileus (4), rhabdomyolysis (1), and in one patient a life-threatening multiorgan failure after a perforation in an abcess located near the anus praeter. Rhabdomyolysis is an unusual complication. In this patient it was probably caused by the operation procedure and not by this specific procedure as there were no other postoperative complications. Three patients (15%) needed reoperation for perforation (1) and pelvic abscesses (2). The 60-day mortality rate was nil.

Efficacy
Twenty-one patients with a T3–T4 tumor based on CT or MRI underwent surgery with 10 abdominoperineal resections (APRs) and 10 low anterior resections (LARs); in one patient the tumor was not resectable. A R0 resection was achieved in 17 patients (81%, 95% CI 58–95%). A pCR was observed in 2 patients (10%, 95% CI 1–30%), and in one patient (5%) the surgical specimen only showed minimal microscopic disease. The postradiotherapeutic pathologic staging yielded in seven patients (33%; 95% CI 15–57%) a downstaging to pT0–T2. After a median follow-up of 14 months, four patients have died due to metastatic disease and one patient has experienced a local recurrence.

). Therefore, it is yet unknown whether the increased toxicity of adding oxaliplatin to a fluoropyrimidine in neoadjuvant chemoradiation schedules results in a clinical benefit for patients with rectal cancer.
In conclusion, this multicenter study demonstrated a neoadjuvant regimen with Capox-RT with an acceptable acute toxicity profile. Randomized phase III studies with in the standard arm 5FU will be necessary to show the true benefit of this approach. In such prospective studies, the standardization of the staging technique (i.e., the distance of the tumor to the endopelvic fascia), TME surgery, radiotherapy, and pathology should minimize the influence of these factors on the outcome.
