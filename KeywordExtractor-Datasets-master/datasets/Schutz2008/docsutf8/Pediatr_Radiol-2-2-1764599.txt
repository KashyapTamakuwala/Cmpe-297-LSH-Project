This article reviews dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) technique and interpretation with emphasis on the considerations unique to pediatrics. Specifically, the use of DXA in children requires the radiologist to be a “clinical pathologist” monitoring the technical aspects of the DXA acquisition, a “statistician” knowledgeable in the concepts of Z-scores and least significant changes, and a “bone specialist” providing the referring clinician a meaningful context for the numeric result generated by DXA. The patient factors that most significantly influence bone mineral density are discussed and are reviewed with respect to available normative databases. The effects the growing skeleton has on the DXA result are also presented. Most important, the need for the radiologist to be actively involved in the technical and interpretive aspects of DXA is stressed. Finally, the diagnosis of osteoporosis should not be made on DXA results alone but should take into account other patient factors.

Introduction
After its commercial introduction in 1987, dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) has become a widely available and clinically useful tool in the evaluation and management of adult bone diseases. More recently, its utilization in the pediatric population has rapidly increased. DXA presents unique challenges to pediatric radiologists, and the aim of this article is to review the technique and interpretation of DXA. Special focus is on the issues unique to pediatric DXA emphasizing the need for an expanded role for the pediatric radiologist in the performance and interpretation of DXA examinations.

Areal vs. volumetric bone mineral density
As in all radiologic studies, DXA relies on the differential absorption of X-rays to differentiate tissues of different radiographic density. In addition, DXA can quantify (in grams) the bone mineral content (BMC) at various body sites. By selecting regions of interest, a bone area (BA) is selected with units of centimeters squared. (The abbreviation BA for bone area should not be mistaken for bone age.) BMD is measured directly for each pixel in the region of interest (ROI) by comparing the X-ray attenuation of that pixel to a reference standard. It has units of grams per centimeter squared. This value is multiplied by the pixel’s area to derive the BMC of that pixel with units of grams. The areas of all the pixels in the ROI are summed to give BA. Thus, BMD = BMC/BA.

] found that the causes for low BMC might be various combinations of factors such as short stature and thin bones, as in children with cystic fibrosis, or short stature and reduced mineralization, as in children with milk allergy. BMC might be normal despite short stature in the presence of wide bones, as in children with previously treated leukemia.

] found children with growth hormone deficiency to be short for their age (low height/age ratio) but to have a normal amount of bone adaptation (BMC) for the muscle force (LTM). The BMC/LTM ratio for these children is normal. In contrast, children with anorexia nervosa with normal height had low LTM and also low BMC/LTM ratios. Their low BMD for age was a result of decreased muscle loading on bone (a secondary bone defect with low LTM/height) and decreased mineralization for the level of muscle loading present (a primary defect with low BMC/LTM). This indicated that a mixed defect caused their low BMD for their age.
In summary, smaller bones will have lower aBMD than larger bones as measured with DXA, even when the vBMD is the same because of limitations of the areal bone density technique. Attempts to correct for or to circumvent this limitation have been proposed and show promise in improving DXA interpretation and our understanding of bone physiology.

Clinical case studies
The following case studies are examples of common clinical indications for DXA in pediatrics and illustrate the principles used at Columbus Children’s Hospital in DXA interpretation.

]. It should be noted that the manufacturer’s normal database yielded a lumbar BMD Z-score of −3.0, but it did not take into account height or weight. The low lumbar BMD Z-score was likely a result of the patient’s short stature (low height Z-score). The weight correction in our normal database partially accounted for her short stature and gave a more meaningful interpretation of the numeric DXA result. This patient’s bone age was 13 years (Z-score −2.3), and using this rather than her chronologic age (16 years) with the manufacturer’s normal database would result in a Z-score of −1.0. This value would better reflect the patient’s actual bone status. Because our database corrects for weight and Tanner stage, each patient is weighed and has a Tanner stage determination made by the referring clinician prior to the DXA study. Thus, we do not use the patient’s bone age in DXA interpretation.

Final recommendations
Pediatric radiologists need to assume a more prominent role in DXA performance, interpretation and research. They require expertise with DXA as a laboratory procedure, a numeric result, and a clinical diagnostic examination. The radiologist must be a “clinical pathologist” closely supervising the acquisition of the DXA study with assessment of quality control data as well as the clinical images. The radiologist must be a “statistician” understanding the principles of least significant change and the relationship of standard deviation scores and percentile rankings. The radiologist must also be a “bone specialist” providing a meaningful context for DXA, translating the numeric value to a clinically useful result. As always, pediatric radiologists must be children’s health advocates by ensuring the appropriate clinical use of DXA as well as actively participating in research efforts.

The final impression indicates whether the sites measured have normal BMD or whether the values are greater than two standard deviations from the mean compared to the appropriate database and corrected for relevant patient factors. If the results are greater than two standard deviations below the mean, the phrase “low bone density” is used. Comparison with previous studies is made, and changes greater than 5% are reported as significant. (A previous repeated measures study for the lumbar spine and hip at Columbus Children’s Hospital found a standard error of measurement of less than 1% for the lumbar spine and 2% for the total hip.)
