Aims/hypothesis
Referred to as CCN, the family of growth factors consisting of cystein-rich protein 61 (CYR61, also known as CCN1), connective tissue growth factor (CTGF, also known as CCN2), nephroblastoma overexpressed gene (NOV, also known as CCN3) and WNT1-inducible signalling pathway proteins 1, 2 and 3 (WISP1, −2 and −3; also known as CCN4, −5 and −6) affects cellular growth, differentiation, adhesion and locomotion in wound repair, fibrotic disorders, inflammation and angiogenesis. AGEs formed in the diabetic milieu affect the same processes, leading to diabetic complications including diabetic retinopathy. We hypothesised that pathological effects of AGEs in the diabetic retina are a consequence of AGE-induced alterations in CCN family expression.

Materials and methods
CCN gene expression levels were studied at the mRNA and protein level in retinas of control and diabetic rats using real-time quantitative PCR, western blotting and immunohistochemistry at 6 and 12 weeks of streptozotocin-induced diabetes in the presence or absence of aminoguanidine, an AGE inhibitor. In addition, C57BL/6 mice were repeatedly injected with exogenously formed AGE to establish whether AGE modulate retinal CCN growth factors in vivo.

 expression increased twofold in the retina.

Conclusions/interpretation
CTGF and CYR61 are downstream effectors of AGE in the diabetic retina, implicating them as possible targets for future intervention strategies against the development of diabetic retinopathy.

Modulation of basement membrane thickening may therefore have a preventive effect on the development of diabetic retinopathy.

Animals
 All animal studies were carried out in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. All experiments involving rats were reviewed and approved by the ethics committee for animal care and use of the Free University Medical Centre, Amsterdam, the Netherlands. All experiments involving mice were carried out in accordance with British Home Office regulations.

In vivo administration of exogenous AGE
 Female C57BL/6 mice (10–12 weeks old) were randomly assigned to two groups of equal size and injected i.p. with either native mouse serum albumin (MSA) or glycoaldehyde-modified MSA (10 mg/kg) daily for seven consecutive days. At 3–4 h after the final injections, mice were killed, eyes enucleated and retinas dissected freshly, before being snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen.

], it is feasible that inhibition of AGE formation could be a common molecular mechanism allowing both ACE inhibitors and aminoguanidine to inhibit the increase of retinal CTGF.
In summary, this study provides the first evidence that, in addition to CTGF, the CCN family molecules CYR61, WISP1 and WISP3 play possible roles in the development of early stages of experimental diabetic retinopathy. At the very least, these results warrant further study into the functional aspects of these molecules in the eye, and of how these aspects pertain to the development of diabetic retinopathy. Additionally, we demonstrate for the first time that AGEs directly upregulate both CTGF and CYR61 levels in the retina in vivo and that aminoguanidine inhibits these diabetes-induced increases. This provides the first evidence that CTGF and CYR61 are downstream effectors of AGEs in the diabetic retina and implicates them as possible targets for future intervention strategies.
