Most of the tissue used for penetrating keratoplasty is issued through eye banks that store the corneoscleral button either in hypothermic storage at 2–6°C or in organ culture at 31–37°C.
These two preservation techniques differ in technical aspects, tissue evaluation possibilities, storage time and microbiological safety. Hypothermic storage is simple and requires little expensive equipment. In general a pre-storage evaluation of the endothelium is performed by specular microscopy and storage time is usually around 7–10 days. Organ culture is a relatively complicated technique requiring more expertise and well-equipped facilities. Evaluation of the endothelium is not only performed before storage, but is routinely performed after storage through the use of light microscopy. With organ culture the allowed storage period is longer, up to four weeks. The vulnerability of organ culture to microbial contamination can be turned into an advantage because it allows the detection of residual micro-organisms on the cornea before surgery. Both preservation techniques seem to result in similar graft survival.
The method of choice for preservation of the donor cornea is dictated by a number of factors mentioned in this review and this helps to explain the geographical differences in the use of the different techniques.

]. Corneas cannot reliably be frozen.
The prevailing storing technique today is the storage of the corneoscleral button. The storage time can be extended by removing the corneoscleral button from the globe. A longer storage time permits greater flexibility in the use of the donor tissue and prevents wastage. In addition in many countries, for different reasons, legal or ethical, corneoscleral disc excision in situ is preferred to the removal of the whole globe. Moreover, the preparation of lamellae and mushroom-shaped grafts from a corneoscleral button is nowadays possible with help of an artificial anterior chamber. With the introduction of the preservation media, corneal surgeons have to rely on highly skilled technicians employed in eye banks selecting and storing the donor tissue.
The original hypothermic storage solution, the M–K medium, has been succeeded by other solutions claiming better and longer maximum storage results. The hypothermic method is common all over the world.

Both storage methods, hypothermic and organ culture will be compared considering technical aspects, tissue evaluation possibilities, storage time, microbiological safety, graft survival and future applications with regard to the increased interest in lamellar grafting.

Technical aspects
General
Procurement and storage techniques have to be performed under aseptic conditions. Increasingly, eye banks have a formally established quality assurance program.
This and the increasing regulation may affect banks working on a smaller scale. For example in France the number of operating eye banks reduced form 226 in 1993 to 43 in 2004.

Hypothermic storage

The medium consists of a tissue culture medium, supplemented with antibiotics, deturgescent agents like dextran and chondroitin sulphate to prevent corneal swelling in vitro, and other additives such as energy sources, antioxidants, membrane stabilizing and growth factors to improve the storage capacity. Inspection of the tissue by slit-lamp and/or specular microscope can be performed in a closed system.

Organ culture
The technique is relatively complicated, despite the fact that nowadays the storage solutions are commercially available.

]. The risk of the ingested dextran in relation to the export area and transport time is judged differently.
7
]. For inspection of the endothelium, mandatory after storage, an invasive technique has to be used, which has to be performed under strict aseptic conditions.
The necessary transfer of the cornea from the storage to the transport solution averts a stored cornea from being directly available for use. Besides, a minimal storage period is required for microbiological testing. All this makes the technique more complicated than the hypothermic storage method.


Tissue evaluation
General
Irrespective of the storage method(s) used the donor should be adequately screened. Tissue that is potentially hazardous to eye bank personnel and the recipient should be excluded in addition to tissue that poses a risk for the success of the surgery. Physical assessment, serologic testing and evaluation of medical and social history of the donor are mandatory.
Routine inspection of the endothelium is also part of the donor evaluation. Moreover, it can play an important role in setting higher and more-uniform quality standards for tissue acceptance. It may also help to increase the donor supply by assessing corneas that may otherwise be arbitrarily excluded for transplantation on the basis of age or time post mortem. The possibilities for evaluation of the endothelium are dependent of the storage method used.

]. In this way it is possible to predict when cell density would reach levels that are incompatible with maintenance of transparency and graft function. The model provides a rationale for the setting of minimum donor cell densities. However, the definite cut-off points are still at the discretion of the bank and surgeon.

].
Most specular microscopes are equipped with software programs to determine parameters describing the endothelial mosaic in terms of variation in cell shape andthe percentage of hexagonal cells in addition to the assessment of the cell density. The obtained morphometric results may help to standardize descriptions, but only provided the microscopes are well calibrated and the necessary interactive manipulation is performed by an experienced observer.

Microbiological safety
General

37
]. As a next step, antibiotics, and in the case of organ culture antimycotics, are present in the storage solutions. These are more effective if the contaminating microbes are metabolically active, which means that they are more effective in organ culture than during hypothermic storage. In addition the vulnerability of organ culture to microbial contamination can be exploited to detect microorganisms remaining from the donor and/or introduced into the culture medium by the environment or personnel. Theoretically, in organ culture the risk of contamination is therefore lower than in hypothermic storage.

]. These may cause an increased incidence of endophthalmitis. From a microbiological point of view, however, it is disputable whether the addition of the latest antibiotics with the widest spectra is the best solution.

Organ culture

Sterility may be better with organ culture since microbial contamination will become more readily evident. Organ culture might be considered as the method of choice in circumstances where corneas are suspected of being at a higher risk of contamination.
The mandatory reporting of adverse reactions and the central registration of these within the EU area where both the hypothermic and the organ culture techniques are used will demonstrate in time whether the incidence of endophthalmitis really differs between organ culture and hypothermic storage.


Graft survival

]. The improvement is not ascribed to the storage itself but to the extra selections routinely included in organ culture preservation. In addition most of the studies were performed at a time when old-fashioned hypothermic storage methods did not always include inspection of the endothelium.

Future aspects

53

]. Whether the storage technique (hypothermic of organ culture) might affect the postoperative fate of the corneal lamella is still open for discussion.
56
57
]. Hypothermic storage, where the thickness of the cornea is maintained and where the risk of epithelial ingrowth is low because there is no epithelial growth, seems to be more suitable for these indications.

Conclusions
58
], such as scheduling operations and minimizing wastage of donor tissue, have become less important. Others still remain: allowing time for tissue typing and matching and extensive testing, detection of residual micro-organisms before surgery, and selecting and dispatching corneas with a well-defined endothelial quality assessed after storage. In addition the pool of possible donors can be enlarged thanks to the possibility of wound healing during organ culture and the inspection of the tissue after storage. Because organ cullture involves extensive testing of the quality of the donor cornea, there are theoretically no preset limits on donor age and postmortem time.
To permit these possibilities the organ culture procedure is more complicated than the hypothermic storage. Well qualified personnel, advice of microbiological laboratory staff, and a well suited facility are essential for a proper organ culture procedure but may also be valuable for hypothermic storage. The higher costs of organ culture have to be balanced against the offered advantages and possibilities not permitted by the hypothermic storage.
Whether organ culture will also be the proper storage technique for surgically manipulated corneoscleral buttons remains to be investigated.
