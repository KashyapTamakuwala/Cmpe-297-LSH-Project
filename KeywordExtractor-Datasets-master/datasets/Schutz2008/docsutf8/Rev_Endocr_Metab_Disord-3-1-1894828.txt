) in the Cardio-facio-cutaneous syndrome. Phenotypic overlap between these genetic disorders can now be explained since each is caused by germline mutations that are major components of the RAS-MAPK pathway. This pathway plays an important role in growth factor and cytokine signaling as well as cancer pathogenesis.

In this review, the clinical findings of the four syndromes will be reviewed. NS will be discussed in more detail since it is common and more clinical studies are available.
Noonan syndrome

]. Although there is wide phenotypic variation in NS, distinctive facial features include hypertelorism, down-slanting palpebral fissures, a high arched palate, low set posteriorly rotated ears, malar hypoplasia, ptosis and often a short neck. The phenotype changes significantly with time. In the newborn, there is excessive nuchal skin which is the result of prenatal cystic hygroma. During infancy, the head is relatively large, the eyes are often prominent and round, there is a high nasal bridge which may be flat, and the neck appears short. At 3 to 4 years of age, the body becomes more stocky and the chest more prominent. The chest deformities often become significant. In later childhood, the facial appearance begins to show coarse features and becomes more triangular as the chin lengthens. The eyes become less prominent and the ptosis may be more apparent. In the teenager and young adult, as the neck lengthens webbing may become more apparent, the facial features are more triangular and become sharper, the nose has a pinched root and a thin high bridge. An older adult has prominent nasal labial folds, a high anterior hairline and the skin often appears rather transparent and wrinkled.
In most, the prenatal history is unremarkable but polyhydramnios is frequent. Height and weight are within normal limits at birth but height begins to drop off within a few months and over 70% of patients with NS have significantly short stature. Some patients with NS have significant feeding difficulties with resulting failure-to-thrive and require tube feedings. Although this may contribute to the poor gain in weight, short stature occurs equally in children who have no feeding problems in infancy. Other important findings include a chest deformity which may be in the form of a pectus carinatum or pectus excavatum, apparent widely spaced nipples and a relatively broad chest. Scoliosis and kyphosis occur in about 15% of patients. Muscle hypotonia is frequent and may account for some of the motor delay. Significant mental retardation is uncommon but some degree of learning disability is frequent and may require special help in school. Eye findings, especially strabismus and refractive errors are common and an occasional patient will have a coloboma. All children with NS should have a complete eye examination. Since conductive hearing loss is rather frequent, children should have a hearing evaluation. Over half of the males with NS have either one or both testes undescended and delay in puberty is common for both males and females.

]. These include deficiency of Factor XI, Von Willebrand’s disease, thrombocytopenia and platelet function defects. In addition, low levels of Factor VIII and XII have also been noted. Hepatosplenomegaly, usually unexplained, is present in about 25% of patients particularly in infancy. Lymphatic abnormalities occur in less than 20% of patients but may present serious problems. Over 80% of patients with NS have a cardiac finding. Pulmonary stenosis is, by far, the most common but nearly every cardiac lesion has been reported. In addition, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy may occur.

PTPN11
 gene to be present in about 50% of patients with NS. This gene regulates the production of a protein called SHP-2 which is essential in several intracellular signal transduction pathways and controls a number of developmental processes including cardiac semilunar valvulogenesis. The protein is expressed throughout the body and it is an important player in cellular response to growth factors, hormones, cytokines and cell adhesion molecules. The PTPN11 mutations in NS are clustered in interacting portions of the N-SH2 in PTTP domains. This mutation results in a gain of function for SHP-2.
Children with NS often present to the endocrinologists because of the short stature, delayed puberty or undescended testes in males. Although height and weight are usually in the normal range at birth, height drops off within the first few months. In general, there is at least a 2-year delay between bone age and chronological age. Continued growth may occur until the early 20s. In both males and females, there is a delay in puberty. Females seem to possess normal fertility. Males, as expected due to undescended testes, appear to have decreased fertility but male transmission is well described and not uncommon.

 gene affects SHP-2, the result apparently is a disruption in the growth hormone IgF-1 axis and IgF-1 deficiency which could be the cause of growth failure.

LEOPARD syndrome (LS)
3
], in 1969, introduced the acronym LEOPARD (LS) to describe a rare syndrome that shares many features similar to NS. These include autosomal dominant inheritance, similar facial dysmorphism and similar cardiac defects with an overabundance of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy compared to pulmonary stenosis. The characteristic cutaneous finding of lentigines is the main distinguishing characteristic. In addition, unilateral or bilateral hearing loss is frequent.

 gene in 27 of the 30 patients studied. Mutations in LS have all occurred in exons 7, 12 and 13 while the more typical NS have the great majority of mutations occur in exons 3, 8 and 13. It is of interest that the mutations in patients with LS show a loss of function rather than gain a function as is found in the more typical NS patients.
20
] noted a specific mutation T468M in exon 12 which was also reported by Sarkozy in seven of their patients with LS to have less adverse effects on body growth. Only two of the ten patients with the T468M mutation have short stature.A cardiac abnormality was present in 71% of the patients with LS, with 80% of those showing hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Pulmonary stenosis was present in two patients and a partial AV canal in another.

. All of these genes belong to the same RAS-ERK pathway that regulates cell differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis. It is likely that the mechanism causing short stature in NS may be similar to that causing short stature in CFC. This is a very rare disease and there is little information regarding endocrine studies in patients with CFC.

] have suggested that in CS, hormone treatment may be harmful because of the propensity to tumor formation and the presence of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. He described two patients, one who had mild left ventricular hypertrophy with normal function before growth hormone was started. After 3 months of treatment, the cardiomyopathy progressed with significant left ventricular outflow tract obstruction with a gradient of 60 mmHg. He was treated with Propranolol. There was no further progression of the cardiomyopathy in spite of continuation of growth hormone. In the second case, growth hormone was started at 12 months and continued until age 26 months when a large pelvic mass was discovered which was proven to be an embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma. Growth hormone was stopped after the tumor was recognized. In spite of extensive chemotherapy, the patient died. Since CS is associated with both subaortic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and tumors, the role of growth hormone in these two patients is unknown. At the present time, it is unclear whether growth hormone is beneficial or harmful in CS.


Conclusion
33
HRAS
 gene associated with CS has an increased incidence of tumors since these mutations are identical to the human tumor associated mutations. So far, CFC syndrome has not been associated with malignancy but the number of reported cases is still quite small with long-term follow-up limited. For the endocrinologist, it is interesting that all of the syndromes have a high incidence of short stature. LS, on the other hand, with loss of function appears to have a lower incidence of short stature but the higher incidence of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. It will be of interest to see how effective IPLEXtm will be in treating the growth failure in NS and perhaps these related syndromes as well. Since the growth failure starts very soon after birth and may indeed start before birth, it is certainly possible that treatment may be necessary very early in life to achieve anywhere near a normal growth stature.
