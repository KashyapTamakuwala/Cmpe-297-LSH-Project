Conclusions
The explanation of the negative correlation between perceived work-related stress and preclinical atherosclerosis was not confirmed either by the subjects under high stress undertaking healthy protective activities or by their escaping into unhealthy behaviour. The most probable interpretation of the results is that in individuals with a low level of perceived work-related stress, somatization of stress takes place.

Introduction
Stress can no longer be recognized as a problem of an individual only. Due to its versatile presence in every human’s life, often resulting in health complications, stress has become a social problem and the role of work-related stress in this puzzle should not be underestimated. Coronary heart disease (CHD) is on the list of stress-related health problems.

The current study aimed to fill this gap and to assess the relationship between work-related stress and preclinical atherosclerotic changes in healthy employees. We considered carotid artery intima-media thickening and/or plaque presence as a surrogate of coronary atherosclerosis. To detect these changes “gold-standard” methodology, i.e., B-mode carotid ultrasound examination, was applied. Because of the complex nature of the pathogenesis of CHD, other contributing factors have not been disregarded.

Methods
Organization of the study
First, all participants took part in a psychological study in which the level of stress and coping were evaluated with relevant questionnaires (see below). Then, the participants consecutively presented themselves for a clinical visit in which a medical examination took place and a blood sample was taken. Tests for biochemical parameters (see below) were performed on the same day as the blood sample was taken, according to routine laboratory procedures. Sera for immunological parameters (see below) were collected and stored according to international laboratory standards, then tested in runs (up to 40 sera per day) to minimize day-to-day variations.

Assessment of coping
The level of coping measured with OSI-2’s Coping scale was as follows: managers—mean = 40, office workers—mean = 38, both groups—mean = 40. According to Polish sten norms the managers’ mean falls on sten five for men and on sten six for women. The office workers’ mean falls on sten five (for both genders). Thus, it can be said that the coping results were in the average range.

Laboratory findings
The abnormality most frequently disclosed in biochemical findings were elevated levels of total cholesterol, LDL and triglycerides (in 52, 39 and 22% of the studied individuals, respectively). Decreased levels of HDL and increased levels of glucose were less frequent and were found in 12% of cases each.

 GPI and HSP-65 (IgG class) were found (in 1% and 3% of studied cases, respectively). None of the studied individuals was positive for aCl. For six sera which were borderline or positive for HSP-65 IgG class, IgM and IgA class antibodies were searched. Only in three cases were the results weakly positive (two in IgM and one in IgA class).

). On the basis of a deep multilevel analysis we were able to show that in healthy individuals, as in CHD patients, individual and biochemical risk factors were likely to play a leading role in the development of early atherosclerosis. Psychosocial stress should also be considered; however, inflammatory-immunological factors have not been found to be an independent predictor.

The present study was undertaken to extend the investigation of psychosocial stress and atherosclerosis. We looked in depth for correlation between preclinical atherosclerosis and work-related stress; correlations with other risk factors of CHD were done in parallel.
As expected, we found correlation between IMT and age, diastolic blood pressure, LDL and anti-HSP antibodies, and correlation between plaque and age, smoking and LDL.
Surprisingly, our results revealed that early atherosclerotic changes negatively correlated with the level of global job strain and some of its components (interpersonal relations, work–home balance, managerial role, organization climate—for IMT; work load, interpersonal relations, work–home balance, responsibility—for plaque).

) disclosed that job strain (high psychological demands and low decision latitude) did not correlate with the presence of coronary disease in angiography, either for men or for women.
By searching for a relationship between work-related stress and atherosclerosis, we wanted to prove that the correlation found between early atherosclerotic changes and LDL and smoking is, at least partly, caused by a higher stress reaction in the studied individuals. It was assumed that individuals with a level of high stress undertook unhealthy behaviour: smoking or excessive food intake. However, for both LDL and smoking the correlation with stress was negative. One should keep in mind that only 39% of the studied individuals had elevated levels of LDL and 47% reported smoking. Therefore, these results should be interpreted causally.
We explored in depth the negative correlation we found between IMT and the presence of plaque, and the level of work-related stress. Being aware that OSI-2 measured perceived stress, another hypothesis was formulated; persons with a high level of work-related stress (conscious stress) undertake preventive activities at the level of coping or healthy lifestyle.

). This theory assumed two cognitive reformulations of the learning theory (stimulus–stimulus learning = classical conditioning and response learning = instrumental conditioning). Both reformulations are essential to understanding the relationship between learning, activation and relations between stress and health. The stress response (an alarm in the homeostatic system) results in behaviors that aim to cope with a situation. The level of alarm depends on what outcome of a stimulus is expected and the specific responses available for coping. Response outcome expectancy might be positive (coping), negative (hopelessness) or none (helplessness). Hence, coping defined as acquired positive outcome expectancy has some predictive value for stress and health.
2003
) research on how people cope with stress situations disclosed avoidant mechanisms (denial, distraction, excessive alcohol consumption) in men, whereas more cardioprotective strategies (depression, asking for help)—in females.
2002
) results disclosed success of a complex intervention program to reduce CHD risk, which included improvement of diet, stress management, social support, smoking and physical activity.
In our study on preclinical atherosclerosis and work-related stress, we were not able to confirm the hypothesis about the above-mentioned prophylactic activities. An analysis of correlation showed no significant relations between work-related stress and coping, between coping and IMT, between work-related stress and healthy lifestyle, or between healthy lifestyle and IMT.

), who claimed that the relationship between stressful work and psychological well-being may be reciprocal. Their results showed that mental health might influence employees’ perceived work characteristics. It is likely that the employees in our study had been recruited from that part of working society who felt fit to undertake ambitious tasks of managers and office workers and who developed job adaptive mechanisms over time.
The most probable interpretation of the negative correlation between perceived work- related stress and preclinical atherosclerosis is that in the case of individuals with a low level of perceived work-related stress, somatization of stress took place, i.e., stress is not perceived at the conscious level but it leads to somatic effects (e.g., IMT).
We are aware of some limitations of our study. Firstly, the results regarding work-related stress were based on self-reported data, which per se could always be a matter of some bias. Secondly, the number of employees studied was limited to 150. Voluntary participation of employees and fully unselected method of recruitment can guarantee the objectivity of the results. Thirdly, it was a cross-sectional study. A prospective type of research on risk assessment is preferable nowadays. However, our study did not aim to assess risk of CHD but to find correlation between work-related stress and early atherosclerosis, so we believe the measure taken for this purpose was appropriate.
We are more than convinced that to achieve full understanding of negative correlation between work-related stress and early atherosclerosis requires further interdisciplinary studies and we would be happy to continue exploration into this intriguing field.
