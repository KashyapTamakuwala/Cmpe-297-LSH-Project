Background
Most studies addressing the volume–outcome relationship in complex surgical procedures use hospital mortality as the sole outcome measure and are rarely based on detailed clinical data. The lack of reliable information about comorbidities and tumor stages makes the conclusions of these studies debatable.
The purpose of this study was to compare outcomes for esophageal resections for cancer in low- versus high-volume hospitals, using an extensive set of variables concerning case-mix and outcome measures, including long-term survival.

Methods
Clinical data, from 903 esophageal resections performed between January 1990 and December 1999, were retrieved from the original patients’ files. Three hundred and forty-two patients were operated on in 11 low-volume hospitals (<7 resections/year) and 561 in a single high-volume center.

Results

Conclusions
Hospital volume and comorbidity patterns are important determinants of outcome in esophageal cancer surgery. Strong clinical endpoints such as in-hospital mortality and survival can be used as performance indicators, only if they are joined by reliable case-mix information.

 Also, the volume–outcome literature for esophageal resections is limited to postoperative mortality as the sole determinant of outcome.
Considering the growing evidence for this volume–outcome relationship for esophageal cancer surgery, we decided to investigate the outcome of these procedures in our region from 1990 until 1999. During this study period none of the 11 hospitals affiliated with the Comprehensive Cancer Center Leiden (CCCL) in the Netherlands performed more than seven esophageal resections a year; all are considered low-volume hospitals (LVH).
In contrast to most volume–outcome studies, we decided to use clinical data obtained from the original patients’ files. We retrieved information about comorbid diseases, tumor characteristics, treatment, and outcome. Next to hospital mortality, several determinants of outcome were examined, such as the number of tumor-free margins and complication rates. Assuming that survival is an essential indicator for quality in cancer surgery, we included a 5-year follow-up. To put our data in the right perspective, we compared these outcomes to the results of the topographically nearest high-volume referral center (HVH).
PATIENTS AND METHODS
All surgically treated esophageal carcinomas in the period 1990–1999 were retrospectively identified through the Leiden Cancer Registry (LCR) of the Comprehensive Cancer Center Leiden (CCCL), in which all cancer patients treated in the midwestern part of the Netherlands are registered (1.7 million inhabitants). All 11 hospitals gave consent to participate in this audit and were visited by two investigators to retrieve the original patient files. Patient demographics, pathological notes, data on the surgical and (neo)adjuvant treatments, comorbidity as well as postoperative morbidity, mortality, length of stay, radicality of the resection, and long-term survival could all be retrieved from the patient’s files.
All tumors were staged according to the UICC TNM classification of 1997. This was done by two independent researchers. The obtained pTNM stages were checked with the pTNM stages registered in the LCR. Any discrepancies were discussed between the researchers and a trained data manager from the CCCL. If consensus could not be reached, the pTNM stage was registered as “unknown.”
To make a comparison with the outcomes of the nearest high-volume center, data were categorized according to the database of this center. In this hospital, data of patients operated on for an esophageal carcinoma are prospectively collected by a trained data manager.
P
 values <.10.
Survival was calculated as the difference between date of surgery and either the date of death or the date of last patient follow-up. For both groups, follow-up of the patients was completed until December 31,, 2005. Observed survival rates were estimated by using the Kaplan–Meier method. The log-rank test was used to assess differences in survival between patients who were operated in LVHs and the HVH. All analyses were conducted using SPSS software (version 12.0; SPSS Inc., Chicago. IL).

DISCUSSION
Currently, there is extensive interest in comparing outcome of complex surgical procedures between high- and low-volume providers. Most of the studies are registry-based or relatively small. Our series offers additional proof to the volume–outcome relationship, because it is based on clinical data, retrieved from the original patient files. This allows us to make reliable comparisons for comorbidities and tumor stage, which proved to be important prognostic factors for in-hospital mortality and survival.

 In the latter publication 135 studies were reviewed, of which only five were not from the United States or Canada. The majority of reports were based on state or national hospital discharge databases, where only a few studies used clinical data for risk adjustment. The outcome measure was “death” in 79% of the studies, without analyzing other dimensions of “outcome,” such as morbidity, length of hospital stay, reoperations, et cetera. For cancer-related procedures, long-term survival was not mentioned. Higher-level methodological issues were rarely addressed. Only five studies concerning cancer treatment adjusted for (neo)-adjuvant therapies or the type of surgical resection, but without any adjustment for tumor stage.

 Urbach and Bachmann used equally sized groups and reported only median volumes of these groups.
Adm denotes administrative data; Clin denotes clinical data; S denotes significant; NS denotes not significant.



In the present study, independent data managers collected data retrospectively from the patient files. Not only the (in-hospital) mortality rate was obtained, but also a range of other outcome data, such as complication rates, resection margins, length of stay, and long-term survival. In our opinion the latter is an important performance indicator in surgical oncology, surprisingly sporadically mentioned in the volume–outcome literature.

 Therefore, the validity of studies that fail to make case-mix adjustments based on clinical data, has to be questioned.

 However, above all, choices made concerning diagnostic strategy, neoadjuvant treatments, and surgical technique are related to the knowledge, experience, and judgment of the (team of) specialists.

 In his study, administrative data about age, gender, comorbidity, and extent of the resection were included in a univariate and multivariate analysis, but stages of the disease, radicality, and intent of the resection (palliative or curative) were not reported.
In conclusion, our study shows that hospital volume is an important determinant of perioperative morbidity and mortality in esophageal cancer surgery. Nevertheless, volume in itself is no guarantee for high quality of surgical care in a specific institution. Selecting (only) favorable patients can be the basis of superior results. Therefore, case-mix adjustments are essential in the assessment of surgical performance of different institutions.
