Policy and finance barriers reduce access to preconception care and, reportedly, limit professional practice changes that would improve the availability of needed services. Millions of women of childbearing age (15–44) lack adequate health coverage (i.e., uninsured or underinsured), and others live in medically underserved areas. Service delivery fragmentation and lack of professional guidelines are additional barriers. This paper reviews barriers and opportunities for financing preconception care, based on a review and analysis of state and federal policies. We describe states’ experiences with and opportunities to improve health coverage, through public programs such as Medicaid, Medicaid waivers, and the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP). The potential role of Title V and of community health centers in providing primary and preventive care to women also is discussed. In these and other public health and health coverage programs, opportunities exist to finance preconception care for low-income women. Three major policy directions are discussed. To increase access to preconception care among women of childbearing age, the federal and state governments have opportunities to: (1) improve health care coverage, (2) increase the supply of publicly subsidized health clinics, and (3) direct delivery of preconception screening and interventions in the context of public health programs.

Medicaid as a source of coverage for women's health and PCC

]. While Medicaid coverage and enrollment for women declined during the mid-1990s as a result of changes in health and welfare policies, Medicaid demonstration waiver projects are now being used by some states expand to access to health care for women of childbearing age.
17
].
23
24
].
Some States have used waiver authority to expand Medicaid coverage to low income, uninsured adults – particularly the parents of children with publicly subsidized coverage. Parents in low-income families may be covered under so-called Section 1931 expansions, which do not require a waiver. More than 40 states and the District of Columbia provide Medicaid coverage to low-income parents through this option. The majority extend short-term coverage to unemployed parents, while other states extend coverage to parents with incomes to 50, 100, or 199 percent FPL, without regard to employment status. Washington State is one state that has used this option to large effect, extending eligibility to 200 percent FPL.
25
]. All three types are authorized under Section 1115 of Medicaid and must be budget neutral. Each type of 1115 requires that states apply for and receive approval by the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS).
Comprehensive and HIFA waivers designed to increase health coverage among low-income adults

26
].
26
]. Some of these (e.g., Maine and Michigan) extend coverage only to childless adults. More target the expansions to low-income parents with children enrolled in publicly subsidized coverage (e.g., Arizona, California, Illinois). Still other states sought a waiver for more general expansion of adult coverage.
With enactment of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (DRA), states have increased flexibility to extend coverage, structure alternative benefit packages, and adopt premium and cost sharing requirements without a federal waiver. The DRA creates the potential for states to expand coverage to additional low-income adults, and some states (e.g., Kentucky, West Virginia) are considering expansions to parents of children with Medicaid or other publicly subsidized coverage under the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP). Such expansions may use limited benefit packages.

Family planning and interconception care waivers

27
]. By February 2005, 21 states had created such family planning waivers.
28
].
29
].
30
]. This is true, despite the fact that the federal government matches state family planning expenditures at 90/10 for each dollar spent. Greater potential savings and prevention, however, could result if States offered coverage for more comprehensive risk screening, health promotion, and interventions leading toward higher levels of preconception wellness. This would require an extension of states waiver authority aimed at coverage of preconception and interconception care.

]. Because Healthy Start funding is linked to Title V funding overall, resources for more extensive or systematic efforts are limited.
Public health programs funded through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), particularly those offering screening and related services for sexually transmitted diseases and HIV/AIDS also could do more to provide preconception risk assessment and health promotion. Such programs targeted to high risk women are not, however, substitutes for access to primary care and health care coverage.
