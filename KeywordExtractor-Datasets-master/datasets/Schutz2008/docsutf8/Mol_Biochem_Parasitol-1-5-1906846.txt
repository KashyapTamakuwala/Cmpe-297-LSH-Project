. Here, we demonstrate that folate uptake by this parasite is a regulated process that is critically dependent upon provision of glucose or another sugar that can proceed through the glycolytic pathway, that the existence of a pH gradient across the plasma membrane is also required for efficient transport, and that folate is transported principally by a proton-symport mechanism.

 uninfected red cells). Prior to uptake assays by naked parasites, infected cells were lysed in 0.05% saponin and the freed parasites washed either in PBS or folate/pABA depleted RPMI 1640, depending upon the experiment. Wash steps were also performed with different buffered or non-buffered isotonic salt solutions where necessary as indicated in the relevant text.
All cells, washed extensively to remove folate present in the culture medium, were mixed with or without glucose (20 mM final concentration) and inhibitors as appropriate, together with radiolabel (normally 1 μCi/ml, equivalent to 38 nM, unless otherwise stated) to make up a total volume of 100 μl with PBS or alternative buffer. All the components were prewarmed to 37 °C before the start of the assay, the reaction mix incubated at 37 °C normally for 30 min, and stopped by addition of 1 ml ice-cold PBS.
When assaying for folate uptake by whole parasitised red cells, these were spun down after the uptake period and the pellet washed with 1 ml ice-cold PBS at least three times to bring extracellular label down to the background level. The washed parasite pellet obtained by subsequent saponin treatment was then lysed with 0.02% SDS before counting. Uptake by naked parasites was determined in the same way. Unless otherwise indicated, the uptake values represent labelled folate that has been imported into synchronised trophozoite stage parasites. All assays were routinely performed in triplicate on different batches of parasites unless otherwise indicated, and the data expressed as the mean ± S.D.

). Cells were then spun down and the radioactivity in the supernatant measured. To measure label exported from free parasites, they were first released from erythrocytes with 0.05% saponin and then washed and treated in a similar manner as for the uninfected red cells. The level of label in the supernatant of the red cell aliquots tripled over the 80 min incubation time, indicative of facile export. However, export of the label from free parasites was much less rapid, only increasing by ∼20% over the same period.

, suggest that although these forms of folate probably play an important role in ultimately retaining the folates in malaria parasites and modulating the affinity of different enzymes for them, conversion to such forms is not rapid and appears not to play any immediate role in the salvage process. The low rate of net export from the parasite is however consistent with the operation of a transport system that actively imports folates into the parasite, where they are efficiently retained (see below).

. Attempts to directly measure a change in pH as a result of folate import in the absence of glucose and using a minimal buffer concentration were unsuccessful, possibly because of the very small quantities that are taken up and the relatively slow rates involved.

 up to 10 mM had only a minor effect (data not shown). It thus appears unlikely that sodium, potassium or divalent metal ions are critically involved in the co-transport of folate into the malaria parasite.

b). Indeed, the apparent absence even of an additive effect showed that when both drugs are present in equimolar amounts, the overall effect is equivalent to that seen with the drug of higher potency, i.e. furosemide. This suggests that the two drugs are likely to be acting on the same target. Given this and the above results with free parasites, where the target involved is shown by our prior experiments to behave as a specific folate transporter, it seems probable that the major effect of these two drugs on infected erythrocytes is also at folate transporters on the erythrocyte membrane, rather than the NPP, although we cannot exclude transport via the latter acting to supplement the endogenous capacity of the erythrocyte to import the higher levels of folate required by the parasite.

. Moreover, if the mutant enzymes (DHFR-TS and PPPK-DHPS) from such parasites process their substrates in vivo with a lower efficiency than in the wild-type, compensation by an increased flux through the salvage pathway might be important for healthy growth, even in the absence of drug. These observations merit extension to other parasite strains with differing responses to antifolate drugs, to further test this hypothesis.

 gradient can be perturbed, which may explain why we also did not observe 100% inhibition of uptake with this compound. Although the profiles observed for nigericin and concanamycin A can be explained in principle by assuming that neither abolishes the pH gradient completely, we cannot exclude the possibility that there is also a component of folate transport independent of this gradient. This scenario is suggested by the fact that a low level of transport persists even when the external pH is set at the same, or a higher, level than the internal pH of parasites deprived of glucose, and would also be consistent with the two-phase nature of the concentration dependence of uptake. At first sight, this picture is difficult to reconcile with the data for DNP, which by insertion into the membrane, permits rapid equilibration of proton concentrations on each side, but we note that complete abolition of uptake only occurs at ca. 1 mM, a concentration at which quite profound changes to the membrane might be expected, possibly impacting on any proton gradient-independent component.

H-folinic acid. Parasites and reagents were prewarmed separately to the desired temperature in a thermal gradient block, mixed to initiate uptake and incubated for 1 h, before harvesting the parasites and counting imported label.



Fig. 2
(a) Time dependence of folinic acid uptake illustrating linearity over 80 min. (b) Rate of uptake into naked parasites (free) and an equal number of parasites within erythrocytes (iRBC). (c) Concentration dependence of uptake illustrating the non-linear (saturable) and linear (non-saturable) components for K1 (diamonds) and FCB (squares), and (d) the saturable components for K1 and FCB compared. Two independent experiments each in triplicate for each of K1 and FCB yielded the kinetic parameters quoted in the text.

H-folinic acid into (a) infected erythrocytes in the presence of 20 mM glucose, (b) free parasites in the presence of 20 mM glucose and (c) free parasites in the absence of glucose, after repeated washes with 154 mM NaCl, to eliminate pH gradient changes across the parasite membrane caused by proton pumping.

H-folinic acid uptake by disruption of the proton gradient using (a) 2,4-dinitrophenol; DNP, (b) nigericin and (c) concanamycin A. Parasites were released from red cells by saponin treatment and washed with HEPES-MES buffer, pH 7.2, with a total ionic strength of 154 mM + 20 mM glucose, to remove medium folate, nutrients and cell debris. The assays were performed in the same buffer at 37 °C for 30 min.
