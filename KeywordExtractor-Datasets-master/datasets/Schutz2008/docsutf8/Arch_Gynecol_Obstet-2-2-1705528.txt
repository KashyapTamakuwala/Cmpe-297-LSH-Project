One common method for treating recurrent genital herpes outbreaks is 3–5 day episodic therapy with nucleoside analogues. However, since maximum viral replication occurs within 24 h after the onset of symptoms, short-term patient-initiated episodic therapy started at prodromal onset or at the first appearance of lesions in patients without a prodrome may represent an important option. In a recent randomized trial, single-day famciclovir treatment decreased lesion healing time and the duration of pain and other symptoms by approximately 2 days compared to placebo, and prevented progression to a full outbreak in almost one in four patients. Because single-day treatment is more convenient than traditional therapies, it may lead to improved patient compliance and better overall management of recurrent genital herpes outbreaks.

]. The 329 study participants experiencing a recurrence of genital herpes were predominately female (71%) and 48% had had more than six recurrences in the preceding year. Participants were given a single day of famciclovir 1,000 mg bid or matching placebo and were instructed to take the medication within 6 h of the onset of prodromal symptoms and/or genital herpes lesions during their next recurrence. The trial results showed that a single-day regimen of famciclovir significantly decreased lesion-healing time and significantly reduced time to resolution of all symptoms by 2 days, as compared to placebo. Famciclovir also halted the progression to a full genital herpes outbreak in almost one in four patients. Adverse events were of mild-to-moderate intensity and were similar to the adverse events experienced by the placebo group.

Conclusion
The rapid onset of viral replication in recurrent genital herpes suggests that a shorter course of therapy would be as efficacious as traditional treatments. Patient-initiated single-day therapy could prove helpful for obstetricians/gynecologists who treat patients with genital herpes, as it may provide a more convenient option for treating the disease, and could help to promote patient compliance. High bioavailability, ease of use, and the added benefit of preventing progression to a full genital herpes outbreak in some patients make famciclovir an excellent candidate for single-day patient-initiated episodic therapy.
