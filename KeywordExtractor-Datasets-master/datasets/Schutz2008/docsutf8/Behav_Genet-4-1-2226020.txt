) showed that the CPRS-R:S ADHD-I is a good screening instrument for DSM-IV ADHD with a sensitivity of 100%, a specificity of 92.5%, and an overall correct classification rate of 96.3%. As far as we know, the relation between CBCL-AP and the CPRS-R:S ADHD-I has not been studied, but given that they are both related to DSM-IV ADHD, these are likely to be correlated.

). Assuming that the convergence between different instruments will be less than perfect, part of the variance will be attributable by instrument-specific factors. It is important to investigate the nature of such factors. If the divergence among instruments is merely a matter of measurement error, we would expect no genetic influences on the instrument-specific factors. Genetic influences on the instrument-specific factors, on the other hand, would suggest that the instruments tap partly unique aspects of children’s behavior.

) analyzed data obtained in a sample of 735 male and 819 female same-sex twin pairs, aged 8–16 years. They modelled the genetic influences on nine measures of ADHD symptomatology, including maternal and paternal DSM-III-R interview data (three dimensions: hyperactivity, inattention and impulsivity), maternal questionnaire data (the Rutter Parental Scale, and the CBCL), and a questionnaire completed by the twin’s teacher. The aim of this study was to determine whether overactivity, inattention, and impulsivity reflect the same underlying genetic liability, while taking method (i.e., instrument-specific) variance into account. In males, 23.7–70.1% of the genetic variance was explained by a common factor that loaded on all nine indicators. A second and third factor loaded on the three dimensions of the maternal and paternal interview data, respectively. The remaining variance (0.0–65.7%) was explained by factors that were specific to each measure. In females, there was also one factor common to all indicators (explaining 16.2–60.2% of the variance), and a second and third factor, which loaded on the three dimensions of the interview data. In contrast to the males, a fourth factor loaded on the three behavioral questionnaires. This factor explained 12.3–46.2% of the genetic variance. In total, measurement specific factors explained 0.0–73.0% of the genetic variance.
The purpose of the present paper is to investigate the construct validity of CBCL-AP, CPRS-R:S ADHD-I, and DSM-IV ADHD. Three questions are addressed. First, what are the phenotypic correlations between the three instruments? Second, do the instruments reflect a common underlying factor? Third, what are the genetic and environmental influences on the common and the instrument-specific factors?

). Mothers of the registered twin pairs receive the CBCL and the CPRS at the ages 7, 10, and 12 years. A subsample of the twins was selected based on their longitudinal CBCL scores. The mothers of these pairs completed a diagnostic interview. The twins, with an age range of 10–13 years (mean age = 11.71; SD = .77) at the time of the interview, were born between 1989 and 1994. The mean time-span between the completion of the interview and the questionnaires was 4.42 (SD = .75), 1.82 (SD = .73), and −.84 (SD = .63) years for the questionnaires completed at age 7, age 10, and age 12, respectively.
Questionnaires were sent to all families that agreed to participate with the research of the Netherlands Twin Registry when the children were born (N = 7,828 families; birth cohorts 1989–1994) at the ages 7, 10, and 12 years. At least one measurement is available for 10,916 twins from 5,458 families, so the response rate is 70%. CBCL ratings were available in 10,018 twins at age 7, 6,565 twins at age 10, and 5,780 twins at age 12. CPRS-R:S ratings were available for 4,887 twins at age 12, and DSM-IV interviews were available for 1,006 twins. Complete data were available in 740 twins. The fact that the number of CPRS-R:S ratings is lower than the number of CBCL ratings, can be explained by the fact that the CPRS-R:S was not included for children born before 1991. The number of available questionnaires decreases over time as a result of the longitudinal character of the study (i.e., a number of children in the study had yet to reach the age of 12).
2000
). Of the 5,458 twin pairs, there were 898 monozygotic male (MZM) pairs, 888 dizygotic male (DZM) pairs, 1,005 monozygotic female (MZF) pairs, 844 dizygotic female (DZF) pairs, and 1,823 dizygotic opposite sex (DOS) pairs.

Selection for the diagnostic interview
2006
). Subjects were excluded if maternal ratings were available at only one time-point, or if they suffered from a severe handicap, which disrupted daily functioning. Twin pairs were selected if at least one of the twins scored high on AP (affected pairs), or if both twins scored low on AP (control pairs). A high score was defined as a T-score above 60 at all available time-points (age 7, 10, and 12 years) and a T-score above 65 at least once. A low score was defined as a T-score below 55 at all available time-points. The control pairs were matched with the affected pairs on the basis of sex, cohort, maternal age, and social economic status (SES). T-scores were computed in boys and girls separately. In other words, girls were selected if they scored low or high compared to other girls, and boys were selected if they scored low or high compared to other boys. This procedure resulted in the selection of similar numbers of boys (N = 499) and girls (N = 507).

Measures

). The mothers of twins were interviewed by ten experienced research assistants to determine which symptoms of ADHD were displayed by the twins during the last year. Maternal ratings of DISC symptoms in their children were assessed by the same interviewer for each twin in a given pair. We analyzed the total number of symptoms.

Statistical analyses
Transformation to categorical data
2004
1998
). It is assumed that a person is “unaffected”, if his or her liability is below a certain threshold, and that he or she is “affected”, if his or her liability is above this threshold. In the present paper, the scores were recoded in such a way that three thresholds divide the latent liability distribution into four categories, of about equal size. The liability threshold model was identified by constraining the variance of the observed variables at 1.
The CBCL AP score was calculated by summing the responses on the 11 items which resulted in a sum score with a possible maximum of 22. The four categories consisted of a score of 0, 1–2, 3–5, and 6 or higher, respectively. The CPRS-R:S ADHD-I score was calculated by summing the responses on the 12 items, which resulted in a sum score with a possible maximum of 36. The four categories consisted of a score of 0–1, 2–5, 6–11, and 12, or higher, respectively. The DISC sumscore with a range of 0 to 18 was transformed into an ordinal variable with four categories. The four categories were: (i) not affected (0 symptoms); (ii) mildly affected (1–2 symptoms); (iii) moderately affected (3–5 symptoms); and (iv) highly affected (more than 6 symptoms). The use of this four category variable provides greater resolution, and so better statistical power than the use of a dichotomous variable (ADHD absent versus ADHD present).

Correcting for the selection
2002
). Given that the data are MAR, unbiased parameter estimates can be obtained by full information (i.e., raw data) maximum likelihood estimation of the parameters in a statistical model that includes the variables that were used for selection. It is essential to include all variables that were used for selection, because the probability of missingness should not depend on the missing part of the data, in which case the data would be missing not at random (MNAR) and parameter estimates would be biased. We therefore included the CBCL ratings obtained at the ages 7, 10, and 12 years in the statistical analyses. All twin pairs in which at least one measure is available are included in the analyses.

1986
). Using ordinal data, the presence of an interaction component can be tested by equating the prevalences of AP/ADHD between MZ and DZ twins. The absence of significant prevalence differences suggests that the presence of sibling interaction or rater bias is considered implausible.
1992
). The triangular decomposition is the least restrictive model, as no specific hypotheses regarding the covariance matrices of A, D, and E are tested. These matrices are merely assumed to be positive (semi) definite. This is a saturated model that can be used to obtain (otherwise unconstrained) genetic and environmental correlations among traits. In the independent pathway model, common and specific genetic and environmental factors are included. In our data analyses of the five variables, we specified a common factor and five instrument-specific factors for each of the factors A, D, and E, which we denote Ac, Dc, and Ec. An independent pathway model provides a good fit to the data if the covariance between the five variables is due to the common factors Ac, Dc, and Ec. Finally, in the common pathway model, a model that is nested under the independent pathway model, it is assumed that genes and environment explain variance in a latent phenotype. This latent factor, of which the variance is constrained at 1, explains variance in the five variables. In addition, the variance of the five variables is allowed to be influenced by instrument-specific influences of A, D, and E. In other words, the common pathway model would provide a good fit to the data if the covariance between the five variables can be explained by a latent construct.
Because the number of twins for whom interview data are available is relatively small, and sex differences in heritability are usually not found, the data from male and female twins were combined in the analyses. To allow for prevalence differences between boys and girls, sex was included as a covariate on the thresholds. The type-I error rate of all statistical tests was set at .05.

. Zygosity did not affect the prevalences of the CBCL, CPRS-R:S, and DSM scores. In view of the absence of prevalence differences in MZ and DZ twins, social interaction effects were not included in the genetic model. The model that was used as the reference model to test for sex differences included as free parameters 30 thresholds, 1 zygosity effect on the thresholds, and five sex effects on the thresholds, one for each measurement. The results showed that boys have significantly more problems than girls on all five measurements; therefore, sex was included as a covariate on the thresholds. Because of the use of categorical scores in the present paper, we did not report means and standard deviations of the CBCL, CPRS-R:S and DSM scores. These descriptives can be requested from the corresponding author by interested readers.

Discussion
The aim of this study was to determine the extent to which three different instruments, which are commonly used to assess ADHD, attention problems, and hyperactivity, measure a common construct. The instruments considered are two scales based on items from questionnaires (CBCL-AP, and CPRS-R:S ADHD-I), and a DSM-IV ADHD interview. First, we considered the phenotypic correlations. Second, we tested if the variance in the different instruments reflects one common underlying factor. Third, we estimated the genetic and environmental influences on individual differences in ADHD. This is the first study that includes multivariate genetic analyses of behavior rating scales and DSM-IV interview data collected in a large sample of twins of approximately the same age. The CBCL scores collected at age 7 and 10 years were included only to correct for the selection. In the discussion, we focus mainly on the CBCL, CPRS-R:S and DSM interview data, which were collected at a mean age of 12 years.
The phenotypic correlation between CBCL-AP and the CPRS-R:S ADHD-I was high (r = .75). The correlations between the CBCL and the DSM and between the CPRS-R:S and the DSM were slightly lower (r = .62). These lower correlations can both be the result of the different time-points at which the behavior checklists and the DSM interview data were collected (the mean time-span between measurement occasions was 10 months), the differences in the time frame for the assessment of the items (e.g., 1 month for the CPRS-R:S, 6 months for the CBCL, and 1 year for the DSM), and of instrument or method variance (e.g., interview versus behavior checklists). The genetic analyses show that the covariance between CBCL and CPRS is for 82% explained by genetic factors while the covariance between CBCL and DSM was for 75% explained by genetic factors. Therefore, the higher phenotypic correlation between CBCL and CPRS is not caused by a relatively higher genetic covariance.
As noted, the AP scale of the CBCL questions relate to both inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity. The fact that the correlation between the CPRS-R:S ADHD-I and DSM-IV ADHD is identical to the correlation between CBCL-AP and DSM-IV ADHD implies that the CPRS-R:S and the CBCL measure ADHD equally well. The description of the eleven item CBCL scale as an inattention scale seems to be too limited, because both the item content and the current results suggest that the CBCL also signals problems related to hyperactivity/impulsivity.

), individual differences in AP and ADHD are mainly explained by genetic factors. An independent pathway model provided a better fit than a common factor model. A common factor model implies a similar structure for the additive genetic, dominant genetic and nonshared environmental influences so the poor fit is probably due to the fact that there are instrument-specific additive genetic factors while these are absent for the dominant genetic factors. As referees of earlier drafts of this paper noted, alternative models might be fit to our data; a model including three common factors (one loading on all ratings, a second loading on CBCL ratings, and a third loading on age 12 ratings, might offer a good solution, but because the structure of A, D, and E differ (with no rating-specific influences for D), we did not fit this model to our data.

), who fit an independent pathway model to ADHD symptomatology based on maternal and paternal questionnaire and interview data, and to teacher reports. Although their best-fitting model included contrast effects instead of genetic dominance, our finding of both common and specific genetic influences on the questionnaire and interview data on ADHD is supported by their results.
The poor fit of the common factor model suggests that the construct validity of the instruments is not perfect. However, it is interesting to consider the implications of the overlap between the sets of genes that explained variance in the three instruments. High genetic correlations imply that the detection of the specific genes that play a role for ADHD, does not depend much on the instrument that is used. At age 12, the additive genetic correlations of the CBCL, CPRS-R:S, and DSM varied between .63 and .76, while the dominant genetic correlations could be constrained at 1. The non-shared environmental correlations are also quite high, and vary between .45 and .68. The dominant genetic correlations of 1 suggest that there is a subset of genes whose effect is not instrument or age dependent. In contrast, the correlations of the additive genetic effects are high but less than perfect. This suggests that the influence of most genes with an additive effect are not sensitive to the particular instrument that is used, although there are some genes that explain variance only in a particular measurement (e.g., CBCL), but not in another (e.g., DSM).

) criteria. The discrepancy in the results of these five studies could be due to low statistical power. The present study showed that the genetic overlap between behavior checklist scores and the DSM-IV diagnosis of ADHD is high. This implies that the detection of genes, which play a role for ADHD, can be based on questionnaire scores, rather than diagnostic interviews. This will reduce the costs of collecting phenotypic data. Resources may then be reallocated to the collection of genotypic data. An increased number of subjects can be genotyped and the statistical power to detect a QTL will be increased.
Limitations
The results of this study should be interpreted bearing in mind the following limitations. First, further study is required to investigate if the results of the current study, which was based on a Dutch population sample, generalize to population samples outside the Netherlands. Second, clinical diagnoses were based on structured diagnostic interviews with the mother. The results may be different when the assessment of ADHD is based on expert clinical diagnoses. Third, no distinction was made between problems related to inattention and problems related to hyperactivity. Since the CBCL does not distinguish between inattention and hyperactivity (and probably the number of items is too small to reliably measure these two factors) we did not distinguish between the subscales. Fourth, we did not allow for sex differences in the genetic and environmental influences based on the results of univariate studies. Because of the increased statistical power in the multivariate model, it is possible that sex differences do exist. However, due to the categorical nature of the data, and the fact that some of the cells in the contingency tables contain few individuals in a two-group analysis, statistical problems will arise in a four-group analysis. Fifth, as a result of the categorical nature of the data, computational limitations prohibited inclusion of confidence intervals.

Clinical implications
Two general approaches towards the measurement of ADHD can be distinguished. In the DSM-IV framework, ADHD is viewed as a categorical trait. Using behavior checklists, children can show variation in a continuum from not affected at all to severely affected. The current study shows that variance in DSM-IV symptoms, the CBCL-AP scale, and the CPRS-R:S ADHD-I is explained mostly by genetic effects. The correlations between the genetic influences on variance in these three measurements of ADHD are high. This implies that different measurements tap the same genetic liability.
