Objective
Whether alcohol consumption influences ovarian cancer risk is unclear. Therefore, we investigated the association between alcohol intake at various ages and risk of ovarian cancer.

Methods
Among 90,371 eligible members of the California Teachers Study cohort who completed a baseline alcohol assessment in 1995–1996, 253 women were diagnosed with epithelial ovarian cancer by the end of 2003. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was performed to estimate relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

Results
P
trend
 = 0.01. The association with wine intake at baseline was particularly strong among peri-/post-menopausal women who used estrogen-only hormone therapy and women of high socioeconomic status.

Conclusions
Alcohol intake does not appear to affect ovarian cancer risk. Constituents of wine other than alcohol or, more likely, unmeasured determinants of wine drinking were associated with increased risk of ovarian cancer.

Alcohol assessment
Participants reported average weekly consumption of beer, wine/champagne, and cocktails/liquor at ages 18–22 years, at ages 30–35 years, and in the year prior to baseline. Available response categories for average number of drinks per week were none, ≤ 3, 4–10, 11–17, 18–24, and ≥ 25. A typical drink was defined as one bottle, can, or glass of beer; one glass of wine, champagne, or wine cooler; or one cocktail, shot, or mixed drink of liquor. A single drink of beer, wine, or liquor was assumed to contain 13.2, 11.1, or 15.0 grams of alcohol, respectively. Based on these standards, daily intake of grams of alcohol from each type of drink was calculated for each woman during each time period. Alcohol intake in the cohort was reproducible (r = 0.87) and valid compared to multiple 24–hour recalls (r = 0.74) (Pamela Horn-Ross, unpublished data).

Date and cause of death are ascertained through linkages with the California state mortality file and the national Social Security Administration death master file, as well as reports from relatives. Address changes are obtained through annual mailed newsletters, notifications by participants, and record linkages with the California Department of Motor Vehicles, the US Postal Service National Change of Address database, and other sources.

], and found no violations of the proportionality assumption.
Hazard rate ratios, presented as relative risks (RR), and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated for each type of alcoholic beverage, comparing categories of consumption to non-drinkers of that alcohol type as the reference group. Tests for linear trend across exposure categories were conducted using the median of each category coded as an ordinal variable. The median of the highest category of beer, wine, or liquor intake was equal to the lower boundary because most women in those categories reported consuming one drink per day.

= 0.02, 1 d.f.). Controlling for total alcohol intake did not attenuate the positive association between wine intake at any time period and risk of ovarian cancer (data not shown). Women who drank wine only in the year before baseline (median daily alcohol intake = 11.1 grams), relative to non-drinkers, had an ovarian cancer RR of 1.40 (95% CI 1.01–1.93). In contrast, risk did not vary between non-drinkers and women who drank beer or liquor only (median daily intake of alcohol = 4.5 grams; RR = 1.03 [95% CI 0.58–1.83]) or beer/liquor and wine (median daily alcohol intake = 11.8 grams; RR = 1.08 [95% CI 0.79–1.48]). The multivariate RR among women who exclusively drank at least one glass of wine per day, compared to non-drinkers, was 1.70 (95% CI 1.10–2.62). After simultaneously adjusting for wine drinking during the year before baseline and at ages 18–22 years and 30–35 years, the RR associated with drinking at least one daily glass of wine at baseline was 1.33 (95% CI 0.91–1.96); at ages 30–35 years, RR = 1.01 (95% CI 0.61–1.68); and at ages 18–22 years, RR = 1.28 (95% CI 0.58–2.87).

The lack of an association with total alcohol, beer, or liquor intake, as well as the persistence of the association between wine intake and risk of ovarian cancer after adjustment for alcohol consumption, suggested that determinants of wine drinking, or ingredients of wine other than alcohol, were responsible for the observed positive association. After mutual adjustment, older age (up to ages 65–69 years), White race, higher total caloric intake, nulliparity, ever-use of oral contraceptives, more physical activity, ever-use of HT, higher SES or median family income, residence in the Greater San Francisco Bay Area, lower body mass index, ever-smoking of cigarettes, and higher intake of coffee and/or tea were significantly associated with drinking at least one daily glass of wine, compared to none (data not shown). However, the positive association between wine consumption and risk of ovarian cancer remained statistically significant even after adjustment for these characteristics (data not shown).

In secondary analyses, we examined the associations between alcohol consumption and risk of ovarian cancer among only women who were peri- or post-menopausal at baseline (46% of the study population, 75% of cases). In this group, we observed the same lack of a significant association with total alcohol, beer, or liquor intake, along with a significant positive association with baseline wine intake. Likewise, when we restricted the case population to invasive ovarian cancer (90% of cases) or to serous ovarian cancer (45% of cases), baseline intake of alcohol from wine, but not from other sources, was associated with significantly increased risk of ovarian cancer.

]. Alcohol consumption during ages 18–22 years, ages 30–35 years, or the year before baseline—whether from beer, liquor, or all sources combined—was unrelated to ovarian cancer development. Additionally, changes in beer, liquor, or total alcohol consumption over time, as well as frequency of drinking in the year before baseline, did not affect ovarian cancer risk in this cohort.
In contrast, average consumption of at least one glass per day of wine in the year before baseline was associated with elevated risk of ovarian cancer, while wine intake at ages 30–35 years or 18–22 years was associated with nonsignificantly increased risk. The positive association with baseline wine intake persisted after adjustment for total alcohol intake, suggesting that the apparent effect of wine on ovarian cancer risk was independent of alcohol content. The association was also unchanged by further adjustment for characteristics and behaviors associated with wine drinking in this cohort, and was not significantly modified by reproductive characteristics, demographic factors, or folate intake. However, there was a significant positive association between wine consumption and ovarian cancer risk among peri-/post-menopausal women who used unopposed estrogen HT, whereas there was no such association among peri-/post-menopausal women who did not use HT or used combined estrogen-progestin HT. Wine consumption was also associated with increased ovarian cancer risk among women of high SES, but not among women of relatively low SES.

]. Even though reporting of alcohol intake in the past year using our questionnaire has been validated, we were not able to assess the reliability or validity of self-reported alcohol consumption at earlier ages, which may be difficult to recall, especially among older women. Misclassification of distant past alcohol intake may explain the absence of a significant association between wine drinking at earlier ages and ovarian cancer risk. Nevertheless, it is unlikely that any exposure misclassification differed systematically between ovarian cancer cases and non-cases, since all information was assessed prospectively.
In summary, given the lack of association between overall alcohol consumption and ovarian cancer risk in our study, further investigations are necessary to determine whether ingredients of wine, but not beer or liquor, foster ovarian cancer development; whether correlates of wine drinking not measured or imperfectly measured in our study population are associated with ovarian cancer risk; or if an association is largely due to the apparent interaction between wine consumption and unopposed estrogen HT use and/or other characteristics of women of high SES. If the observed association between wine drinking and ovarian cancer risk is due to confounding, then there may exist an as-yet unidentified ovarian cancer risk factor that is also associated with wine drinking. On the other hand, if the interactions with estrogen HT use and SES are confirmed, there may be a biological basis for the increased risk of ovarian cancer among wine drinkers with high endogenous and exogenous estrogen levels. However, if alcohol consumption is indeed unrelated to ovarian cancer development but positively associated with the risk of breast cancer, then differences in the hormonal and non-hormonal triggers between these two malignancies may help us understand the carcinogenic effects of alcohol on hormonally responsive tissue. Further understanding of the complex relationships among steroid hormone levels, metabolism of alcohol and wine, and carcinogenesis will help clarify what role, if any, alcohol and wine play in the development of ovarian cancer.
