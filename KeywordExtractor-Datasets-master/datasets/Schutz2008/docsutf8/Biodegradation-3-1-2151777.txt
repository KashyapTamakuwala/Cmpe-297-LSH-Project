). Possible intermediates of alkylamine degradation were not identified in these studies. Therefore, much remains to be learned about the substrate specificity of long-chain alkylamine degrading micro-organisms and the biodegradation pathway.
The aim of this study was to investigate how alkylamines are degraded by micro-organisms using a pure culture capable of utilizing alkylamines as sole carbon and energy source. Substrate specificities of the pure culture and cell-free extracts catalysing the initial degradation steps are reported.

Activated sludge
Activated sludge used as inoculum was obtained from the wastewater treatment plant Nieuwgraaf in Duiven, The Netherlands. This activated sludge plant treats predominantly domestic wastewater.

 agar. The cultures and agar plates were incubated at 30°C. The growth rate of strain BERT was recorded by measuring the increase in turbidity in culture flasks with a Hach Ratio XR turbidimeter (Hach, Loveland, CO, USA). The ability of the strain to grow on other substrates was tested using similar media in which dodecylamine was substituted with possible intermediates or other fatty amine derivatives.

. This set-up was required because of transport of the alkylamine through silicone tubes. Cells were also cultivated in the fermentor with acetate, octanal and octanoate under the same conditions but with a mineral salts medium containing the respective organic compounds. The pH of the reactor was maintained at 7.
Experiments on the nitrogen balance were also conducted in the fermentor fed with a mineral salts medium without ammonium chloride. The nitrogen recovery was estimated from the amount of nitrogen leaving the fermentor as biomass, ammonium and total nitrogen. The total nitrogen represents the residual substrate and/or water-soluble nitrogen-containing compound formed during the biodegradation process.

Enzyme assays
All enzyme assays were performed at 30°C. Spectrophotometric enzyme assays were carried out in a Shimadzu UV 160A spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) in 1 cm light-path cuvettes. The oxygen uptake was measured with a polarographic oxygen monitor (Yellow Springs Instruments).

Aldehyde dehydrogenase (NAD(P)-dependent) activity was determined by measuring the increase in absorbance at 340 nm. Reaction mixtures contained phosphate buffer (15 mM; pH 7), 0.15 μM aldehyde, 1.0 mM NAD and 0.1 mM KCN and enzyme solution in a volume of 3 ml.

Protein was quantified by bicinchoninic acid method. Cells were first lysed by incubating at 95°C with 1.0 M NaOH. The protein concentration was estimated by using the Bio-Rad Protein assay kit with bovine serum albumin as standard protein. Dissolved organic carbon and total nitrogen were quantified with a Shimadzu TOC apparatus (Shimadzu).

Depletion of dodecylamine to non-detectable concentrations from the nitrogen-free mineral salts medium in batch cultures and the concurrent growth of the isolate clearly demonstrate that this isolate also used alkylamines as its nitrogen source (data not shown).

 strain BERT was 0.4 g dry weight of cells per g of octylamine utilized. The fate of the nitrogen of octylamine in terms of ammonium, biomass-nitrogen, nitrogen-containing soluble microbial products and residual octylamine was assessed in a continuous culture. Total nitrogen, ammonium and biomass-nitrogen were measured in triplicate. Approximately 25 ± 3% of the nitrogen was recovered as biomass-nitrogen. Octylamine-nitrogen was converted for 60 ± 4% into ammonium. Less than 1% of the nitrogen in the effluent was present as octylamine. Approximately 10 ± 2% of the nitrogen was recovered as water-soluble nitrogen-containing products.

This enzyme may have evolved from methylamine dehydrogenases or short-chain alkylamine dehydrogenases involved in the degradation of naturally occurring amines.

). This can be explained by biocidal effects and limited bioavailability. Reading across of the ready biodegradability test results enabled by this study reveals that all long-chain alkylamines—both saturated and unsaturated—are readily biodegradable. Future research should focus on identifying the intermediates and purifying the enzymes involved in the degradation of alkylamines.
