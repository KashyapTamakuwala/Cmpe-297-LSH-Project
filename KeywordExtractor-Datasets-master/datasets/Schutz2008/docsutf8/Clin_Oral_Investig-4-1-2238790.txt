Survival of endodontically treated, post-restored teeth depends on a multitude of factors, all of which are practically impossible to include in a randomized, controlled clinical study. The purpose of this survey was to characterize and analyze reported failures of post-retained restorations to identify factors critical to failure and to type of failure. A questionnaire was mailed to private practitioners in Denmark with a request to complete the questionnaire whenever a patient presented with a failed post-retained restoration. Information was gathered on factors related to the patient, the tooth, the restorative materials, and the techniques. Two-hundred and sixty questionnaires were collected from 171 practitioners over a 3-year period. Functioning time until failure varied between 3 months and 38 years. Mean survival time until failure was 11 years. Of the failed restorations, 61% had functioned for 10 years or less. Fracture of the tooth was the most common type of failure reported, followed by loosening of the post and fracture of the post. Tapered posts implied an increased risk of tooth fracture compared to loosening or fracture of the post, and the relative risk of tooth fracture increased with the functioning time until failure. Fracture of the post was more common among male than female patients. On the basis of this survey of failed post-retained restorations, it was concluded that tapered posts were associated with a higher risk of tooth fracture than were parallel-sided posts.

]. Thus, to minimize the negative influence on longevity, the restorative procedure of endodontically treated teeth calls for careful consideration of treatment alternatives.
In the case of minimal-remaining tooth substance, the retention of a crown has traditionally been provided by a core and the retention of the core by a post. Two fundamentally different techniques find widespread use for the construction of a post and core: (1) a post and core cast as a single unit and (2) a prefabricated post upon which a core is directly produced in, e.g., amalgam or resin composite. The first prefabricated posts on the market were made of stainless steel or gold-plated brass. Later, posts of titanium alloys became popular, and recent developments have introduced posts made of fiber-reinforced resin composite or ceramic. Simultaneously, adhesive dentistry, offering reliable bonding to tooth substance and to restorative materials via various pretreatments, has markedly progressed to widen the possibilities also for post and core treatment.
As mentioned, the post serves to retain the restoration. However, the post should also serve to protect the remaining tooth structure. These two functions of endodontic posts may be evaluated by determining the retentive ability of the posts and the fracture resistance of endodontically treated teeth provided with post-retained restorations. The latter may also be indirectly determined by analysis of the stress-distributing characteristics of the posts. Post-related factors that have been found to exert influence on retention of posts and protection of tooth structure include: shape, length, diameter, surface design, and stiffness of the post as well as the type of luting cement used.

]. The purpose of this survey of failed post-retained restorations was to analyze reported failures in an attempt to identify factors that are critical to failure and to type of failure.

Materials and methods
A questionnaire was developed and piloted, and in June 2000, it was posted, in five copies, to the members of the Danish Dental Association who worked in private practice (3,444 practitioners). The practitioners were asked to complete the questionnaire in case a patient presented with a failed post-retained restoration. Questions were asked about age and gender of the patient, tooth involved, number of posts, type, design, length, and diameter of the post(s), type of core, type of luting agent, type of restoration, height of any ferrule, degree of tooth destruction, functioning time until failure, and type of failure.
α
 = 0.05). Cross tabulations were carried out to further characterize the data and to identify codeterminants of functioning time until failure and codeterminants of type of failure.

Of the 260 failed post-retained restorations, 54% comprised tapered posts, 22% comprised parallel-sided posts, 20% comprised posts of a combined tapered-parallel design, and 4% comprised posts with a design that was not accounted for. The majority of the cast posts (76%) and of the stainless steel prefabricated posts (73%) were tapered. The titanium posts were equally distributed between the three designs (38, 31, and 31%), and the carbon fiber-reinforced resin composite posts were either parallel sided (50%) or of a combined design (50%).

Of the 130 teeth with a failed restoration that had been treated with a prefabricated post and a direct core, 29% had a core made in amalgam, 59% a core made in resin composite, 3% a core made in glass ionomer cement, and 9% a core made in a material that was not accounted for. Amalgam had been used more often than resin composite for stainless steel posts (70 vs 30%), whereas resin composite had been used more often than amalgam for titanium posts (84 vs 16%) and, in all cases, for carbon fiber-reinforced resin composite posts.
Of the 260 failed post-retained restorations, 40% had been luted with zinc phosphate cement, 17% with glass ionomer cement, 10% with resin cement, and 33% posts with an agent that was not accounted for. The majority of the cast posts (68%) and of the stainless steel prefabricated posts (93%) had been luted with zinc phosphate cement. Most titanium posts had been luted with zinc phosphate cement (48%) or glass ionomer cement (37%). Of the carbon fiber-reinforced resin composite posts, 90% had been luted with resin cement and 10% with glass ionomer cement.
Of the 260 failed restorations 69% had a ferrule, 29% did not have a ferrule, and 2% were not accounted for. As regards the degree of tooth destruction before luting of the now failed post-retained restoration, only 25% restored teeth out of 260 were accounted for. In 47 cases, the whole clinical crown had been missing at the time of restoration, and in 18 cases, between one half and three fourths of the clinical crown had been missing.

Discussion
Five percent of the private practitioners that had been invited to participate in the survey did so. Possible explanations for this low response rate include the open invitation design, the relative extensive questionnaire, and the fact that the questionnaire could not be completed once and for all but had to be procured whenever a patient presented with a failed post-retained restoration. Considering that prosthodontics is not a registered specialty in Denmark, there is no reason to believe that the treatments provided by the participating practitioners were of another type or quality than those provided by private practitioners in general. The fact that the questionnaires were filled out by individual practitioners in their everyday environment and not by calibrated investigators in an optimal research facility explains that the response rate to each question was not 100% and also implies some uncertainty as to the validity of the answers, especially those that included an element of estimation, e.g., of post diameter. The abovementioned factors call for some caution when interpreting the results of the survey.

The types of posts, cores, and cements used for the failed restorations, not only reflect that preferences vary among practitioners but also that the age of the restorations vary widely, as did the materials and treatments available at the time of restoration. Given the design of this survey, i.e., we have only considered restorations that have failed, we have no knowledge of the entire population of post-retained restorations. Thus, the survey does not allow distinction between an over-representation of a given material or treatment caused by outspread use and over-representation caused by poor longevity.

], only 17% had survived more than 5 years. The longer lifespan found in the present survey may reflect that the samples of the previous surveys included posts that were generally shorter and more often smooth and/or tapered than the posts of the present survey. These features are likely to have increased the prevalence of loosened posts at an early stage.
A number of specific types of posts or materials were found to have significantly high prevalence in the group of post-retained restorations that failed after a relatively short functioning time: carbon fiber-reinforced resin composite posts, posts cast in silver–palladium, parallel-sided and combined tapered-parallel posts, resin composite cores, and resin cement and glass ionomer cement. Some of these posts and materials are probably found in this group of restorations that failed after a short functioning time, not because they in fact are associated with short functioning time but because they have been on the market for a relatively short time compared with the alternatives and thus are over-represented in the total group of restorations with a short functioning time.

]. Failures in the form of loss of retention are most often restorable, whereas tooth fractures are most often nonrestorable and lead to extraction of the tooth. It is possible that it was easier for the practitioner to remember to submit a questionnaire when a more drastic tooth fracture occurred than when a post had lost retention and had to be recemented. Such a situation would tend to underestimate the proportion of loosened posts. An alternative explanation is that the distribution between types of failure has indeed changed to reflect a decrease in the use of smooth and tapered posts.

]. With regard to extent of remaining tooth structure, the reason is that an exceptionally low response rate did not allow statistical analysis of this parameter on a possible influence on functioning time and type of failure. The fact that the survey also did not find a significant influence of the existence of a ferrule calls for the following comments. First, the fact that most restorations were reported to have a ferrule reduced the probability that the statistical analysis would find a significant effect. Second, it is very positive to note that clinicians are aware of the importance of including a ferrule in the preparation. Third, the fact that restorations failed despite that the crowns had a ferrule points to the relevance of optimizing other elements in the restoration of an endodontically treated tooth.

Conclusions
Fracture of the tooth was the most common type of failure among the failed post-retained restorations followed by loosening of the post and fracture of the post.

Compared with parallel-sided posts, tapered posts more often displayed fracture of the tooth and less often fracture of the post.

Post-retained restorations that had functioned for a long time before failure showed an increased risk of tooth fracture compared to loosening of the post and fracture of the post.

Fracture of the post was more common among male patients than among female patients.
