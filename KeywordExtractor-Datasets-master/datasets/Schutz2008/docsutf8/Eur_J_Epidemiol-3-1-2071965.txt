Background and Objective
To compare levels of and trends in incidence and hospital mortality of first acute myocardial infarction (AMI) based on routinely collected hospital morbidity data and on linked registers. Cases taken from routine hospital data are a mix of patients with recurrent and first events, and double counting occurs when cases are admitted for an event several times during 1 year. By linkage of registers, recurrent events and double counts can be excluded.

Study Design and Setting
In 1995 and 2000, 28,733 and 25,864 admissions for AMI were registered in the Dutch national hospital discharge register. Linkage with the population register yielded 21,565 patients with a first AMI in 1995 and 20,414 in 2000.

Results
In 1995 and 2000, the incidence based on the hospital register was higher than based on the linked registers in men (22% and 23% higher) and women (18% and 20% higher). In both years, hospital mortality based on the hospital register and on linked registers was similar. The decline in incidence between 1995 and 2000 was comparable whether based on standard hospital register data or linked data (18% and 20% in men, 15% and 17% in women). Similarly, the decline in hospital mortality was comparable using either approach (11% and 9% in both men and women).

Conclusion
Although the incidence based on routine hospital data overestimates the actual incidence of first AMI based on linked registers, hospital mortality and trends in incidence and hospital mortality are not changed by excluding recurrent events and double counts. Since trends in incidence and hospital mortality of AMI are often based on national routinely collected data, it is reassuring that our results indicate that findings from such studies are indeed valid and not biased because of recurrent events and double counts.

], we set out to compare the nationwide (trends in) incidence and hospital mortality of first hospitalized AMI based on routinely collected data in the hospital register (double counts and recurrent events included) and based on linkage of the hospital register with the population register (double counts and recurrent events excluded).

]. As the hospital register does not contain a unique personal identifier, we tracked individuals over time within the hospital register by using information from the Dutch population register. This database contains information on all registered persons living in the Netherlands, including date of birth, gender, current address, postal code and nationality. Patients registered in the hospital register were identified in the population register using linkage variables ‘date of birth’, ‘gender’ and ‘numeric part of postal code’. When patients moved, their hospital admissions were recognized by using the new postal code registered in the population register.

Cohort enrolment from linked registers 
After linkage with the population register using linkage variables ‘date of birth’, ‘gender’ and ‘numerical part of postal code’, 25,142 and 22,470 admissions came from patients with a unique combination of linkage variables in the population register (88% and 87%, respectively). Thus, each remaining admission linked to only one unique individual in the population register (one unique individual in the Netherlands). Admissions linking with more than one person (e.g., administrative twins; two persons with the same date of birth, gender and numeric part of postal code registered in the population register) or with no person at all (e.g., non-residents or administrative errors) in the population register were excluded. Selection of the first admission per person of all subsequent admissions of a person occurring during 1995 and 2000 yielded 23,172 patients in 1995 and 20,414 patients in 2000. Thus, 1,970 double counts had occurred in 1995 (8%) and 2,056 in 2000 (9%). Information on admissions in previous years of the patients in 1995 was obtained by selecting all hospital admissions registered in the hospital register with principal diagnosis AMI in the period 1991–1995. These admissions were linked to the cohort of 23,172 patients with linkage variables ‘date of birth’, ‘gender’ and one or both of the variables ‘numerical part of postal code’ and ‘hospital-specific patient identification code’. Linkage with the population register was not possible, since this register started in October 1994. Subjects who linked in this process were patients with previous hospital admissions for AMI (recurrent AMI patients) and were excluded (1,607 patients (7%)). This resulted in the final cohort of 1995 consisting of 21,565 patients. Information on hospital admissions in previous years of the patients in 2000 was obtained by linking of the hospital register of 1995–2000 to the population register with linkage variables ‘date of birth’, ‘gender’ and ‘numerical part of postal code’. All uniquely linked admissions with principal diagnosis AMI were selected and linked to the cohort of 20,414 patients. Patients with previous hospital admissions for AMI (recurrent AMI patients) were excluded (1,356 patients (7%)). This resulted in the final cohort of 2000 consisting of 19,058 patients.
Thus the linked register comprises information for only part of the Dutch population (i.e., those that were unique on date of birth, gender, and postal code), and does not include double counts, and recurrent AMI admissions.

Results
In both 1995 and 2000, the gender and age distribution of the cohort based on the hospital register was comparable to the cohort based on linked registers. In 1995 and 2000, two-thirds comprised men. The mean age in 1995 was 63.7 years in men and 71.5 years in women based on the hospital register. This was 64.3 and 71.9 years, respectively, based on linked registers. In 2000, the mean age based on the hospital register was 63.6 years in men and 70.9 years in women. Based on linked registers, this was 64.2 and 71.6 years, respectively.

). In men, hospital mortality declined absolutely by 1% and relatively by 11% based on both the hospital register and linked registers. In women, the absolute and relative decline was 2% and 9%, respectively, based on both the hospital register and linked registers. The age-specific relative changes in hospital-based and linkage-based hospital mortality were largely similar.

Discussion
We combined data from the national hospital discharge register with data from the population register to determine the (trends in) incidence and hospital mortality of first hospitalized AMI (double counts and recurrent AMI cases excluded) and compared the outcomes with the incidence and hospital mortality based on routinely collected data in the hospital register (double counts and recurrent AMI cases included). The incidence based on the hospital register was considerably and significantly higher than the incidence based on linked registers, whereas hospital mortality and trends in incidence and hospital mortality were identical using either approach.

] Third, the outcome measures in the present study were incidence and hospital mortality. Mortality after discharge from hospital was not considered, since this outcome is not registered in the hospital register. Differences in mortality after discharge between patients with a first or a recurrent AMI can only be studied by linkage of national registers (i.e., the hospital register with the population register and the cause of death statistics). A final aspect that needs to be addressed is the generalizability of our findings. The results might differ if a change over time occurs in double-count or readmission fractions. Results might also differ for other diseases than AMI or for specific groups of patients (e.g., non-native patients), hospitals or regions. Such differences will not be apparent from routinely collected data. Since trends in incidence and hospital mortality are often based on national routinely collected data, generalization of our findings would be of great relevance.

]. These time trends indicated a decline in incidence of myocardial infarction and in case fatality after AMI. In the present study, we found a significant decline in both incidence and hospital mortality of first AMI between 1995 and 2000. These declines in incidence and hospital mortality appear to mainly reflect declines in first events, as trends were not altered when recurrent cases were excluded from the data, and thus are best explained by advances in primary prevention and acute management of AMI.
Overall, our results based on deterministic linkages of sources using gender, date of birth and postal code, are in line with earlier reports from other studies, where linkage was performed using unique identification numbers.
In conclusion, our study shows that the incidence based on routinely collected data in the national hospital discharge register overestimates the actual incidence of first AMI based on linked national registers by least 22% in men and 18% in women. Yet, the hospital mortality based on the hospital register accurately reflects the actual hospital mortality of first AMI. Furthermore, trends in incidence and hospital mortality based on the hospital register are not changed when double counts and recurrent cases were excluded. Since trends in incidence and hospital mortality of AMI are often based on national routinely collected data, it is reassuring that our results indicate that findings from such studies are indeed valid and not biased because of recurrent events and double counts.
