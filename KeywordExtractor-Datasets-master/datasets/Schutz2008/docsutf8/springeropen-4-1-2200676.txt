Danio rerio)

. In order to identify the molecular basis for the adaptations to CCH, we profiled the gene expression changes in the hearts of adult zebrafish. We have analyzed over 15,000 different transcripts and found 376 differentially regulated genes, of which 260 genes showed increased and 116 genes decreased expression levels. Two notch receptors (notch-2 and notch-3) as well as regulatory genes linked to cell proliferation were transcriptionally upregulated in hypoxic hearts. We observed a simultaneous increase in expression of IGF-2 and IGFbp1 and upregulation of several genes important for the protection against reactive oxygen species (ROS). We have identified here many novel genes involved in the response to CCH in the heart, which may have potential clinical implications in the future.

In this study, we have identified CCH-induced gene expression changes in the zebrafish heart by looking at over half of the zebrafish genome. We have compared several of these novel changes described in other species and tissues. We have here identified the heart-specific molecular adaptations to CCH. Future functional experiments are warranted to determine whether some of the findings can be used to better adapt mammalian hearts to CCH.

Our animal protocols were approved by the review board of Leiden University in accordance with the requirements of the Dutch government. Zebrafish were kept at 25°C in aquaria with day/night light cycles (12 h dark vs. 12 h light). Cichlids were kept at 25°C with the same day/night light cycles.

concentration and fish were then directly set in the equilibrated aquaria.

Perfusion of cichlid hearts
In order to minimize blood clotting, a perfusion protocol was developed in which the whole blood volume of clinically dead animals was initially replaced with isotonic buffer and with a fixative solution secondarily.

Heart dissection
The fish were killed with an overdose of anesthetic (MS-222; Tricaine Methanesulfonate from Argent Chemical Laboratories, USA). Hearts were dissected from the fish immediately after the anesthetic worked. For RNA preparation the hearts were immediately shock-freezed in liquid nitrogen. For histology and microscopy, the hearts were left intact and fixed immediately in Karnovsky fixative (4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) and 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.2) for 4 h at 4°C. After three washes in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, they were transferred to 70% ethanol.

RNA preparation and biological sampling
After dissection hearts were homogenized in a Dounce homogenizer using 1 ml Trizol solution (GibcoBrl, Life technologies). The whole heart was used and for each biological sample hearts were pooled from five different animals. After Trizol extraction, total RNA was further purified using RNAeasy columns (Qiagen). RNA samples were analyzed for quality control by Lab-on-a-chip analysis (Agilent) and on agarose gels. For the array experiment five arrays were done for normoxic and 5 arrays for the hypoxic condition. Biological samples (BS) came from two independent experiments and one technical replicate (TR) was included (2BS + 2BS + TR for normoxia and 2BS + 2BS + TR for hypoxia). As mentioned above for each BS, hearts from five different animals were pooled.

Gene expression changes in the heart of adult zebrafish under chronic constant hypoxia (CCH)
In this study, we used microarrays for the transcriptional profiling of up and downregulated genes in response to hypoxia in the zebrafish heart. We identified 376 genes that were differentially expressed under hypoxic conditions, out of which 116 genes showed a decrease in gene expression (30.9%) in comparison to 260 genes which showed increased expression levels (69.1%).
All 376 differentially expressed genes, including the ones with oligo sequences which could not be annotated so far (referred therein either as transcribed locus or zebrafish clone) are shown in the complete file (Supplemental Table 1). Functional groups are color coded and if possible, gene functions are briefly summarized and OMIM links given.

Discussion
In the aquatic environment, oxygen concentrations can often vary, and being able to adapt to changes in oxygen levels can be advantageous for the survival of aquatic animals. This might be in part the reason why some teleosts have developed the ability to withstand extreme hypoxic conditions.
In this study, we have focused on the long-term response to hypoxia in the fish heart. The hypothesis is that the zebrafish heart, in contrast to most mammalian hearts, which are characterized by relative intolerance to injury or the lack of oxygen, are able to adapt to extreme hypoxic conditions.

). In the case that the increase in cardiac myocyte nuclear density during chronic hypoxia was due to nuclear hyperplasia and nuclear ploidy, the observed smaller ventricular outflow tract and reduced lacunae may have been the result of hypertrophy of the existing cardiac myocytes. The histological assay in this study does not clearly distinguish between hyperplasia and hypertrophy of cardiac myocytes. Future investigation of the mechanisms underlying the general morphological adaptations of teleost fish heart in response to CCH requires a nuclear stain in combination with a clear membrane stain, which allows determination of cell sizes in addition to counts of cardiac myocyte nuclei.

). Other changes found like upregulation of the two Notch receptors have not been described before to the best of our knowledge. Similarly, the simultaneous increase in expression of IGF-2 and IGFbp1 has not been shown. The changes identified here can contribute to the ability of teleosts to adapt to severe hypoxia (for example, the upregulation of fetuin-α and sepp1 levels). Future functional studies are warranted to validate the role of the identified genes in cardiac protection to hypoxia.
