 = 8) were reviewed. Eight of the 9 lesions were stained with hematoxylin-eosin and microscopically examined.

Results
There were 3 male and 4 female patients with an age range of 22 to 55 years (average age, 44 years). Two patients had two lesions at different sites. The lesions involved the cervical spine in 4 patients, the lumbar spine in 2, the sacrum in 2, and the coccyx in 1. The most common symptom was mild pain. The lesions of 2 patients were found incidentally during imaging studies for unrelated conditions. Five patients underwent surgical procedures. One patient died of surgical complications. All other patients have been well without recurrent or progressive disease for 13 to 84 months. Radiographs usually did not reveal significant abnormality. Five lesions exhibited subtle sclerosis and 1 showed intense sclerosis. Technetium bone scan did not reveal any abnormal uptake. Computed tomography images had increased density within the vertebral bodies. The lesions had a homogeneous low signal intensity on T1-weighted magnetic resonance images and a high intensity on T2-weighted images without soft-tissue mass. Microscopically, lesions contained sheets of adipocyte-like vacuolated chordoid cells without a myxoid matrix.

Conclusions
Benign notochordal cell tumors may be found during routine clinical examinations and do not require surgical management unless they show extraosseous disease. These tumors should be recognized by radiologists, pathologists, and orthopedic surgeons to prevent operations, which usually are extensive.

], but based on the few cases with long-term follow-up (those previously published and our present series) none has clinically grown to become a chordoma. The anatomical predilection is identical to that of chordoma. The most common locations are the sacro-coccygeal region and the base of the skull, followed by cervical and lumbar vertebrae. Most tumors are usually small and asymptomatic and are often found at autopsy. The occasional lesion may become large and can be detected on advanced imaging. Our working group collected 7 cases of BNCT that were detected on imaging. We report on their management, outcomes, and histology. Five patients underwent surgical management based on a misdiagnosis of chordoma and failure to recognize the entity of BNCT. This paper focuses on the clinical, radiological, and histological features of these cases, which get overtreated when misdiagnosed.

). Often the lesions are invisible on radiographs. CT scans may reveal unequivocal sclerosis, which is much more obvious than on radiographs. No bone destruction or cortical disruption is recognized. T1-weighted MR images reveal relatively well-demarcated intraosseous lesions with homogeneous low signal intensity. T2-weighted MR images show homogeneous high signal intensity. Gadolinium-DTPA enhanced T1-weighted MR images do not show enhancement. Bone scintigraphy did not show any abnormal uptake.
Diagnosis of the cases presented was based upon biopsy or preoperative imaging; the diagnosis was chordoma in 5 cases and osteonecrosis in 2. Hence, 5 patients underwent vertebrectomy, wide resection, or curettage. All patients but 1 are well without recurrent or metastatic disease. Two patients who underwent only biopsy had no progressive disease, as judged by radiography, CT, or MR images, for 13 months and 44 months respectively. As described by Mirra and Brien, the follow-up information was consistent with the benign nature of the tumors.

]. We believe the reason for this discrepancy is that the cervical and lumbar regions often are examined with MRI for neck pain and low back pain. Lesions in the sacrum and coccyx may be overlooked because they are less frequently imaged.

]. Imaging is critical in separating the benign lesion from the chordoma. Chordomas are osteolytic tumors. In contrast, BNCTs may show osteosclerotic reaction and do not exhibit osteolytic change. Chordomas are not intracompartmental lesions and are associated with a soft tissue mass. In those cases with histological overlap, with our present understanding of these diseases, we would suggest that the absence of a soft tissue mass should favor a BNCT and the presence of a soft tissue mass should indicate a chordoma.

]. We, however, are not aware of any cases of what we term BNCT growing beyond the confines of bone and displaying features of chordoma, and therefore they should be managed as benign lesions and carefully followed by thin section CT and MRI for signs of extraosseous disease. More extensive follow-up by cross-sectional imaging over a long period of time would be required before firmly determining the biological behavior of BNCTs. BNCTs do not require any surgical management until they undergo malignant transformation. BNCTs should be recognized by radiologists, pathologists, and orthopedic surgeons to prevent unnecessary radical surgery and carefully followed by advanced imaging.
