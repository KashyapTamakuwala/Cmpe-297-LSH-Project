 = 0.04). Clinical benefits, including an overall survival advantage, were also seen in women who crossed over from placebo to letrozole after unblinding, indicating that tumors remain sensitive to hormone therapy despite a prolonged period since discontinuation of tamoxifen. The efficacy and safety of letrozole therapy beyond 5 years is being assessed in a re-randomization study, following the emergence of new data suggesting that clinical benefit correlates with the duration of letrozole. MA.17 showed that letrozole is extremely well-tolerated relative to placebo. Letrozole should be considered for all women completing tamoxifen; new results from the post-unblinding analysis suggest that letrozole treatment should also be considered for all disease-free women for periods up to 5 years following completion of adjuvant tamoxifen.

Trial design and patients

]. The aim of the trial was to determine whether letrozole improves outcome after the discontinuation of adjuvant tamoxifen therapy. The MA.17 trial was led by the National Cancer Institute of Canada Clinical Trials Group and included the North American Breast Intergroup and the Breast International Group. Institutional review boards of participating institutions approved the study protocol, and all patients gave written informed consent.
Patient population
The trial enrolled 5,187 postmenopausal women with early-stage breast cancer in whom 5 years of tamoxifen (range 4.5–6 years) therapy had been completed less than 3 months before enrollment. Eligible women had to have histologically confirmed, HR+ primary breast cancer. HR+ tumors were defined as estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) or progesterone receptor-positive (PgR+) as determined by a level of 10 fmol/mg of protein or a positive immunohistochemical analysis. Women were defined as being postmenopausal if they were aged at least 50 years at the start of adjuvant tamoxifen therapy, were <50 years of age at the start of tamoxifen therapy but postmenopausal at the initiation of tamoxifen therapy, were <50 years at the start of tamoxifen therapy but had undergone bilateral oophorectomy, were premenopausal and <50 years at the start of tamoxifen therapy but became amenorrheic during chemotherapy or treatment with tamoxifen, or were any age but had postmenopausal levels of luteinising hormone or follicle-stimulating hormone prior to the study. All women had a good performance status and life expectancy of at least 5 years.

Data were adjusted for baseline patient and disease variables including tumor size, nodal status, and prior adjuvant chemotherapy. A preliminary analysis suggests that letrozole has significant clinical benefits in patients in whom treatment with the AI is started after a prolonged period since the discontinuation of tamoxifen. The publication of these results is eagerly awaited as they may effect patient care worldwide.

Safety of letrozole in the extended adjuvant setting
The women included in this trial had been disease-free for approximately 5 years during treatment with tamoxifen and, therefore, the safety and tolerability of continued hormone treatment with letrozole was an important consideration when the MA.17 trial was designed. Furthermore, early unblinding of the trial has not prevented the collection of long-term safety data, and additional sub-studies are providing useful information on the safety profile of letrozole in the extended adjuvant setting. The safety of AIs is discussed in detail in the paper by Dr. Perez in this supplement.

]. Therefore, if a patient misses the chance to start letrozole within 3 months post tamoxifen, these results suggest that there is still a benefit to initiating letrozole therapy for up to 5 years following the discontinuation of tamoxifen. Importantly, women in all risk categories benefited in terms of reduced risk for recurrence of their cancer. Thus, in both node-positive as well as node-negative women, there was a strong improvement in DFS, and “low risk” status of the primary tumor should not preclude consideration of extended adjuvant therapy with letrozole. Extended therapy with adjuvant letrozole should therefore be considered for all women currently completing tamoxifen. In addition, in women who have completed tamoxifen within the last 5 years, introduction of letrozole for 5 years can be discussed because although we do not have level 1 evidence for benefit in this setting as yet, our post-unblinding analysis of MA17 strongly supports the potential for benefit in these women.

]. The optimal agent, sequence of treatments, or combination of treatments will be able to provide the greatest improvement in OS with minimal acute and long-term toxicity. MA.17 has demonstrated that letrozole is highly effective and extremely well tolerated when given in the extended adjuvant setting. The results of the pivotal MA.17 trial have changed current clinical practice to extend letrozole protective therapy in thousands of breast cancer patients currently receiving 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen. The benefits of long-term adjuvant letrozole treatment clearly outweigh any adverse events in postmenopausal women who have survived breast cancer after initial adjuvant therapy with tamoxifen. Long-term side effects and risks continue to be monitored and taken into account when any individual patient is being considered for extended adjuvant therapy.
