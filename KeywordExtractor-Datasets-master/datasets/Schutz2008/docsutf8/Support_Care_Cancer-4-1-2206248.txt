Goals of work
This study examined the quality of life (QoL) of cancer patients diagnosed 1–5 years previously and their spouses, with children 4–18 years living at home. Relationships between parents’ QoL and the children’s functioning were explored.

Patients and methods
166 cancer patients and their spouses provided information on their QoL (RAND-36) and on their children’s functioning (Child Behavior Checklist).

Main results
Male and female patients scored similarly to a norm population on five domains. Patients’ QoL was clinically relevantly and/or statistically lower on social functioning, role limitations because of physical problems, and vitality than the norm. Male spouses’ QoL was comparable to the norm. However, female spouses reported better physical functioning but more social problems. QoL varied according to type of cancer, treatment intensity, and recurrence. Using the QoL composite scores, a significant relationship was found between patients’ psychosocial and physical functioning and spouses’ psychosocial functioning. Patients’ psychosocial functioning correlated moderately strongly to weakly with their reports of their younger children’s and adolescents’ functioning; physical functioning correlated only weakly with adolescents’ functioning. The patients’ functioning related weakly to moderately strongly to adolescents’ self-reports of functioning. Spouses’ psychosocial functioning weakly related to their and adolescents’ reports of adolescents’ functioning.

Conclusions
Cancer patients’ QoL 1–5 years after diagnosis was decreased in three of eight domains; their spouses seem to be doing well. Parents’ physical and psychosocial functioning related weakly to moderately strongly to their children’s functioning, depending on the child’s age and information source. The patients’ functioning related more strongly to the children’s functioning than the spouses’ did.

], we expected to find that female patients reported the lowest QoL, followed by female partners, male patients, and male partners. The second aim was to examine the effect of illness-related variables (time since diagnosis, recurrence, treatment intensity, and type of cancer) on parents’ QoL. We expected that patients and spouses would report more problems more shortly after diagnosis, when confronted with recurrence of cancer and when treatment was intense and, also, that QoL would differ depending on type of cancer. Our third aim was to examine relationships between patient’s and spouse’s QoL; we hypothesized that they would be significantly related. Finally, the fourth aim was to explore possible relationships between the parents’ QoL and the children’s emotional and behavioral functioning.

Materials and methods
Procedure
Both hospitalized cancer patients and those being treated or seen for follow-up visits at the outpatient clinic of the University Medical Center Groningen between January 2001 and February 2003 were approached by surgical, medical, and radiation oncologists and oncology nurses. Patients were eligible for the study if they were diagnosed with cancer 1–5 years before study entry and had children between the ages of 4 and 18 years at the time of parent’s diagnosis who resided or had frequent contact with the diagnosed parent. Furthermore, both parents and children needed to be fluent in Dutch. A family could participate in the study if the patient and at least one child agreed to participate. Physicians and oncology nurses offered all eligible patients and spouses written information plus an information brochure adapted for the children. Informed consent was obtained from each family member separately, as regulated by the Medical Ethical Committee of the University Medical Center Groningen. After obtaining informed consent, researchers mailed packages with questionnaires and prepaid return envelopes to each family member. Cancer patients, spouses, and children were instructed to fill in questionnaires independently of each other and to not discuss their answers.

Instruments
Demographic data was gathered on: age, gender, level of education, length of relationship, number of children living at home, and who the primary caregiver in the family is. Patients provided information about when they were diagnosed, their type of cancer, treatment intensity, and recurrence. Education was measured on a seven-point scale from (1) elementary school only to (7) university degree.

]. In this study, the internalizing (emotional functioning), externalizing (behavioral functioning), and total problem (total of internalizing, externalizing, and cognitive problems) scales were used to provide a picture of the problems occurring in the children of parents diagnosed with cancer. The CBCL’s and YSR’s reliability and validity have been supported in a great number of studies. In this study, Cronbach’s alphas for the internalizing, externalizing, and total problem scales ranged from 0.84 to 0.94 for reports from patients, spouses, and adolescent children.

]. Our study focused on a subgroup of cancer patients, namely those who are relatively young. The finding that our patient group scored similarly to the norm seems to indicate that these patients’ lives have gotten fairly back to normal. These parents seem to be handling the unexpectedness of a cancer diagnosis during this life phase, the treatment, or the confrontation with a possible death at an early age, coupled with the responsibility of raising children fairly well. However, they still seem to experience problems in some areas, specifically social functioning, role limitations because of physical problems, and vitality.

]. A second explanation could be that spouses viewed their QoL relative to their ill partner and therefore regarded their own health as good as or better than people generally may. It is also possible that we did not find a decreased QoL in the spouses because our patient group ranged from 1 to 5 years after diagnosis; time since diagnosis correlated significantly positively with spouses’ physical functioning. The threat that the patient might not survive may be less prominent for spouses at this point in time.

] that found that distress levels varied depending on cancer site. With regard to how spouses function, no significant QoL differences were found because of the type of cancer or treatment intensity. It would seem that tumor type or treatment intensity do not affect spouses’ functioning. Whether the patient had a recurrence does seem to affect spouses’ QoL; the ES of the psychosocial summary score was strikingly large. This may be due to, for those spouses, the still current threat that the patient may not survive. It is interesting to note that recurrence seems to have affected patients’ physical and social functioning but not their mental functioning. Patients with recurrence do not report more mental distress than patients who have not had a recurrence.

Research considerations
In our investigation, being the first to evaluate family functioning in families in the child-rearing age, we purposely did not choose a homogenous cancer group (i.e., only breast cancer). Our results are statements for the general group of child-rearing families with cancer. Comparisons between patients in our research group with varying diagnoses showed differences between groups; however, the small subgroups make it difficult to generalize our findings. Future research will be required to investigate the effect of varying forms of cancer, the stage of cancer, its prognosis, and treatment on the functioning of individual family members.
19

].
In conclusion, cancer patients’ QoL 1–5 years after diagnosis seems to be returning to normal, except in three domains. Their spouses seem to be doing well. The patients’ QoL varied according to the type of cancer, how intense their treatment had been, and whether they had experienced a recurrence. Spouses’ QoL seemed to be unaffected by the type of cancer and treatment intensity but did vary depending on whether the patient experienced a recurrence. A moderate positive relationship was found between the patient’s functioning and his/her spouse’s. Parents’ physical and psychosocial functioning was weakly to moderately strongly related to their children’s functioning. The patients’ functioning related more strongly to the children’s functioning than the spouses’ did. How cancer patients’ families function may have an impact on the patient’s functioning, up to 5 years after diagnosis. This is something that should be taken into account by clinicians.
