This is the first demonstration of a process having a combined alkaline pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass and pH control in fermentation resulting in a significant saving of lime consumption and avoiding the necessity to recycle lime.

The objective of this research was to evaluate whether high alkaline-treated lignocellulosic biomass (without neutralization) can be used directly in a SSF process by (1) providing a carbon source for enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation and (2) providing a source of alkali to control the pH in the fermentation process.

The pH of this stock solution was adjusted to 6.4 with 2 M hydrochloric acid and autoclaved for 15 min at 125°C. The remaining nutrients were dissolved in stock solution B (1.33 times concentrated), which was also adjusted to pH 6.4 with 2 M hydrochloric acid but was filter sterilized (cellulose acetate filter with pore size of 0.2 μm, Minisart, Sartorius). After sterilization, the medium was prepared by combining stock solutions A and B and Gelrite plates were poured. The bacteria were cultivated on Gelrite plates for 48 h at 50°C.

), and the pH of the supernatant was adjusted to 5.0 with barium carbonate using a pH indicator (Bromophenolblue) followed by filtration of the liquid. The analysis was performed by high-performance anion-exchange chromatography using a Carbopack PA1 column (column temperature of 30°C) and a pulsed amperometric detector (ED50; Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). Before injection, the system was equilibrated with 25.5 mM NaOH for 10 min at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. For the separation of monomeric sugars, at injection, the mobile phase was shifted to deionized water for 30 min. Postcolumn addition of sodium hydroxide was used for detection of the neutral monomeric sugars.

The chiral purity (%) of lactic acid was determined by derivatization of all lactates using methanol, after which both enantiomers of methyl lactate were separated on a chiral gas chromatography column and detected using a flame ionization detector. The chiral purity was expressed as the area of the main enantiomer divided by the sum of areas of both enantiomers.

). By the dehydration procedure of the LTWS, part of the acetic acid was easily separated from the substrate by removing the press water. Apparently, a remaining amount of acetic acid was fed together with the substrate to the fermenter. Furthermore, minor traces of other organic acids such as succinic acid and formic acid (<0.5 g/l) were detected in the fermentation broth.

(+)-lactic acid purity of 97.2% was analyzed. This slight decline in lactic acid purity is possibly a result of infection with other undesired lactic acid-producing microorganisms. Because the substrate used was not sterile and also the chemical pretreatment and fermentation occurred in an open system under nonsterile conditions, microbial contamination throughout the SSF process is possible.

Neutralization of acid by alkaline substrate
The lactic acid produced (342 g) during the fed-batch phase (II) was neutralized with alkaline-pretreated wheat straw. During this phase, an amount of 2,328 g LTWS was added to the fermenter. Together with this substrate, an amount of 230 g calcium hydroxide was added to the fermenter and accounted for a ratio of 0.67 g calcium hydroxide per gram of lactic acid. The lactic acid (369 g) produced during the batch phase (III) was neutralized with 163 g calcium hydroxide resulting in a ratio of 0.44 g lactic acid per gram calcium hydroxide.

) and results, in comparison to other pretreatment routes, in minor inhibitor formation. However, before the enzymatic hydrolysis, it is essential to adjust the pH to a level optimal for enzymatic activity. In this study, the reduction in pH by washing or neutralization was omitted by using the alkaline character of LTWS to neutralize lactic acid produced by microbial fermentation during a SSF process.

b). This addition of new enzymes resulted in a modest liberation of hemicellulose sugars (xylose, arabinose), but no further hydrolysis of glucan occurred. This shows that the remaining glucan was too recalcitrant or not accessible for further hydrolysis, resulting in decreasing lactic acid productivity. Another possible explanation of the decreased lactic acid productivity is the inhibition of enzymes and/or bacteria by the increasing lactic acid concentration.
