We generated detailed measures of drinking water risks by tracing each individual’s mains water supply back to the water treatment works and into the source catchment.

]. These data represent just under half of all the cases reported to national surveillance in England and Wales over that period (Chalmers et al. in preparation). From the original dataset of 8075 cases, 3343 were analysed once a number of records were removed from the analysis. All cases where the patient had reported recent foreign travel (22%) were removed from the sample as the infection may have been acquired overseas. These data were based upon information collected by laboratories from the faecal sample request form that was filled in by the patient or physician. It is likely, based on information from previous work, that travel information is under-reported. Further cases were removed due to gaps in the geographical coverage of the independent variables (5%) and the inability to identify the species using PCR-based methods (2%).
However, the main reason for the removal of cases were records which, had incomplete postcodes (59%) meaning that it was impossible to identify an accurate residential location. It is important to consider whether this omission may be correlated with any of our independent variables and hence introduce bias into the results. One source of missing postcodes is transcription omissions at individual laboratories but because these are likely to affect samples in a random manner they are unlikely to be correlated with any independent variables. The second major source is omissions by general practitioners due to them having inaccurate patient records or failing to include postcodes when submitting samples to laboratories for analysis. There is no evidence as to whether this varies systematically in a manner, which would bias the results of this research.

] some of the control postcodes may have contained affected individuals. However, the reported rate of cryptosporidiosis in England and Wales is only 9 per 100,000 per year and so even taking into account under reporting and asymptomatic infection, the probability of a control postcode containing cases remains extremely low. Furthermore, such a bias would only tend our results to the null hypothesis.

A range of socioeconomic variables were obtained by identifying the 2001 Output Area within which each postcode was located. Output areas are the smallest area for which census data are released and contain approximately 125 individuals. Within each Output Area the percentage of people in each of the eight socio-economic status bands were identified. These ranged from higher managerial and professional occupations to those in routine occupations. Additionally, the proportion of the population aged 0–4 years and the percentage employed in agriculture was obtained. Finally a measure of health care accessibility was derived by calculating the travel time from each postcode to the nearest GP.

 applications to land, sewage discharges and sewage overflows in each were calculated. The probability of biofilm build-up was simulated by calculating the volume weighted, average straight line distance between each postcode and the water treatment works supplying their water.

. A forward regression technique was performed by adding the most significant variable in turn. Collinearity was avoided by ensuring that the addition of each variable did not lead to significant changes in the coefficients or significance of any other variables in the model. Standardised forms of the independent variables were entered into the models. Results are presented in terms of Odds Ratio (OR) estimates and the 95% Confidence Interval (CI). The statistical analysis was undertaken using STATA/SE 8.2.

 oocysts used for this study from records held by local Health Protection Teams or Units. The omission of outbreak cases had a minimal impact upon the results implying that outbreak cases are not significantly influencing the results presented. Consequently, the models presented in this paper are inclusive of all cases.

 show different signs for the urban area variable. This implies that any bias due to differential general practitioner completeness of postcode information between urban and non-urban areas is likely to be minimal.
In this study no associations were found between cryptosporidiosis and the proxy variable for biofilm build-up, accessibility to healthcare or the proportion of the population employed in agriculture. This suggests that these variables are not of major importance to cryptosporidiosis aetiology or that our methodology was unable to create effective measures of them.
