 their effects on cell wall modification might be very local. To really affect wall architecture, it might be important to select CBMs that bind to different kinds of polysaccharide (promiscuous), so that the effect is not confined to one location or cell type. Most research activity relating to the potential use of CBMs for plant cell wall modification has been on cellulose-specific CBMs. In this investigation we have used different CBMs which not only recognise hemicellulose as opposed to CBM3 but are also to some extent promiscuous.

). This is indicative of the great abundance of their interacting ligands in the primary cell walls of grasses. It was therefore of interest to investigate the heterologous expression of these promiscuous CBMs in plants, and, more importantly, to compare their effects with those of less promiscuous CBMs, whose characteristics are described below.

The blots were re-hybridized, after stripping, with a 489 bp [α32P]dCTP-labelled fragment of a tobacco 18S ribosomal RNA gene (GenBank accession no. AJ236016), as a control. The ribosomal probe was amplified from tobacco genomic DNA using oligonucleotides 5′-gaaactgcgaatggctcatt-3′and 5′-attaccgcggctgctggc-3′ for PCR amplification.

), which may have led to the eventual collapse of, particularly, the primary walled cells (and not so much of the secondary-walled xylem cells). Thus, because of the extensive loosening of their cell walls and consequent altered expansion, the cortical cells may have yielded to tissue pressure within the stem. The altered cell enlargement, which led to the collapse of the cortical cells of the tandem CBM29-1-2-expressing stems, is proposed as the cellular basis for the reduced stem elongation. We have not noticed that the increased size of the xylem cells led to thicker stems. It is possible the gain in the size of the xylem cells is neutralized by the collapse of the cortical cells.

). It is, therefore, possible the CBMs had already bound to hemicellulose before their deposition in the cell wall. As a result, the hemicellulose content, length, and/or branching pattern might have changed; this, in turn, could affect their interaction with cellulose microfibrils, leading to structural alteration of the cell wall.

) of enhanced growth of transgenic potato plants expressing a bacterial CBM3. These contrasting results might be because of the different specificities of the CBMs, because we have used double CBMs in our investigation as opposed to the single CBM they used. That the experiments were performed on different plant species may also have contributed to the different observations.
