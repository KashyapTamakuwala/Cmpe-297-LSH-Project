The issue of tight glucose control with intensive insulin therapy in critically ill patients remains controversial. Although compelling evidence supports this strategy in postoperative patients who have undergone cardiac surgery, the use of tight glucose control has been challenged in other situations, including in medical critically ill patients and in those who have undergone non-cardiac surgery. Similarly, the mechanisms that underlie the effects of high-dose insulin are not fully elucidated. These arguments emphasize the need to study the effects of tight glucose control in a large heterogeneous cohort of intensive care unit patients.

Until the end of the past millenium, relatively little attention was given to control of blood sugar levels. In critically ill patients, hyperglycaemia was considered to be physiological because it results from the metabolic and hormonal changes that accompany the stress response to injury. In most intensive care units (ICUs), blood sugar was checked every 4–6 hours and hyperglycaemia (defined as blood sugar levels >10–12 mmol/l [180–216 mg/dl]) was corrected by subcutaneous or intravenous insulin. The presence of pre-existing diabetes mellitus or post-neurosurgical status often prompted more intense control of hyperglycaemia. Furthermore, the issue of glucose control was discussed in few sessions or satellite symposia during intensive care meetings.

]. In a European survey (unpublished data) we found considerable variation in the glycaemic thresholds employed in ICUs, which ranged from 6 to 11.1 mmol/l (108–200 mg/dl).

]. Although the report by Vriesendorp and coworkers challenges the concept of tight glucose control, it can hardly be considered a major piece of evidence against it. Indeed, blood glucose concentrations were presented as means of values recorded only over 48 hours, whereas the ICU stay extended up to 71 days, with a median of 3 days. Insulin was administered to only 9% of the patients during the 48-hour period of observation. In addition, patients received a mean of only 22.5 g glucose/day, and were fed early after surgery with an enteral solution of 'immunonutrients' – a potential confounding factor with respect to infectious morbidity. However, despite these limitations, as well as others that are acknowledged by the authors, the findings of the study support the hypothesis that tight glucose control could be of greater benefit to patients with cardiovascular disease than to those without.

], further studies are needed to confirm the benefits of tight blood glucose control with intensive insulin therapy in a heterogeneous population of ICU patients. Hence, a large randomized prospective multicentre trial is warranted. Such study will also help in determining the physiological importance of the effects of insulin and, more importantly, will provide intensive care workers with key information for guiding the management of blood glucose in critically ill patients.
