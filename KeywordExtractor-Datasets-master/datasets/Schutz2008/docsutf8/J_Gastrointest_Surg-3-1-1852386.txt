Purpose
Assessment of tumor proliferation rate using Bromodeoxyuridine labeling index (BrdUrdLI) as a possible predictor of rectal cancer response to preoperative radiotherapy (RT).

Methods and material
Ninety-two patients were qualified either to short RT (5 Gy/fraction/5 days) and surgery about 1 week after RT (schedule I), or to short RT and 4–5 weeks interval before surgery (schedule II). Tumor samples were taken twice from each patient: before RT and at the time of surgery. The samples were incubated with BrdUrd for 1 h at 37°C, and the BrdUrdLI was calculated as a percentage of BrdUrd-labeled cells.

Results
Thirty-eight patients were treated according to schedule I and 54 patients according to schedule II. Mean BrdUrdLI before RT was 8.5% and its value did not differ between the patients in the two compared groups. After RT tumors showed statistically significant growth inhibition (reduction of BrdUrdLI). As the pretreatment BrdUrd LI was not predictive for early clinical and pathologic tumor response, prognostic role of the ratio of BrdUrdLI after to BrdUrdLI before RT was considered. The ratios were calculated separately for fast (BrdUrd LI > 8.5%) and slowly (BrdUrd LI ≤ 8.5%) proliferating tumors and correlated with overall treatment time (OTT, i.e., time from the first day of RT to surgery). One month after RT, accelerated proliferation was observed only in slowly proliferating tumors.

Conclusions
Pretreatment BrdUrdLI was not predictive for early clinical and pathologic tumor response. The ratio after/before RT BrdUrdLI was correlated to inhibition of proliferation in responsive tumors.

 study provided a clinically significant biologic effect of a short preoperative course of radiotherapy on the tumor size and on the incidence of nodal metastases; however, this effect was minimized if surgery was performed immediately after radiotherapy. The effect is most likely caused by death of tumor cells in the primary tumor and in the involved nodes. A short treatment course of radiotherapy, i.e., 5 × 5 Gy is desirable, and this regimen is currently considered as the gold standard in many centers. However, using this schedule it is difficult to observe a down-staging and/or downsizing of the tumor, which is of importance for the selection of patients for sphincter-preserving surgery (anterior resection).

 showed that low doses in short RT only offer clinically relevant reduction in the risk of pelvic relapses if the overall radiation treatment time is short. Thus, the rate of cancer cell proliferation seems to be a very important prognostic factor.
The aim of this study is to evaluate BrdUrd LI and S-phase fraction (SPF) as the possible indicators of tumor proliferation rate and predictors of the tumor response to neoadjuvant RT in patients with rectal cancer, and to suggest an optimal interval between short RT course and surgery.

Methods and Materials
Patients

 situated less than 12 cm from the verge of the anus, and gave informed consent for their participation. The protocol was approved by the Ethical Committee of the Center of Oncology, and each patient gave written consent.
The criteria for exclusion were: locally nonresectable tumor; plan to perform only local tumor excision; known metastatic disease; previous radiotherapy of pelvis region; other malignant disease; and patient’s refusal.

Preoperative Radiotherapy
The patients assigned to preoperative radiotherapy received a total tumor dose of 25 Gy. The treatment was given in five fractions over 5 days, one posterior and two lateral wedged fields were irradiated with photons of maximum 6 MV energy. According to the random selection surgery was performed the following week (schedule I) or after longer interval of 4–5 weeks (schedule II).

Surgery
Anterior resection of rectum or abdominoperineal excision was performed within a week or a month after the completion of RT. Type of surgery was resection of the rectum and lower sigmoid with involved adjacent tissue and regional lymph nodes up to or above the origin of inferior mesenteric artery. A minimal touch technique was used with high tight ligation of the inferior mesenteric artery. The decision whether the patient should have an abdominoperineal resection or a sphincter-preserving surgery was made by the surgeon during the operation.
An abdominoperineal resection of rectum was performed in 41 (44.6%) of the patients, and sphincter preserving surgery was performed in 51 (55.4%).

Biological Assessment of Tumor Response
Tumor samples were taken twice: before radiotherapy (through a rectoscope) and during surgery from the same place, i.e., at the lowest edge of the tumor mass. Each biopsy was divided into two parts: one was used for BrdUrd LI assessment, and the second was used for immunohistochemical analysis (these results will be the subject of a separate study).

 cells. Aneuploidy was assessed in cases in which the normal and neoplastic cell populations gave two separate peaks. Human lymphocytes were used for the reference peak. Tumors with BrdUrdLI >8.5% (median value) were considered as fast, and those with BrdUrdLI ≤8.5% were considered as slowly proliferating tumors.

Clinical Assessment of Tumor Response

:
Complete response (CR): 100% disappearance; partial response (PR): 30–99% decrease; stable disease (SD): neither CR, PR or PD criteria met; progression of disease (PD): 20% increase in sums of tumor longest diameters.

Pathological Assessment of Tumor Response

 were applied:
D0—no regression; D1—dominant tumor mass with obvious fibrosis and/or vasculopathy; D2—dominantly fibrotic changes with few tumor cells or groups; D3—very few (difficult to find microscopically) tumor cells in fibrotic tissue with or without mucous substance; D4—no tumor cells, only fibrotic mass (total regression or response).

Statistical Methods

 values of less than 0.05 were considered to indicate statistical significance. Linear regression was applied for assessing differences between fast and slowly proliferating tumors in relation with OTT, and its significance was determined by testing the difference between two correlation coefficients. Stratification by BrdUrd LI level was introduced and tested by the inclusion of dummy variable in the regression model.

Discussion
This study provides evidence of a clinically significant biological effect of a short preoperative course of RT on tumor proliferation rate. The impact of irradiation on biological tumor response was assessed by BrdUrd LI, SPF, and the degree of subsequent pathologic and clinical down-staging of the tumors after surgery. The study showed differences in the pretreatment proliferation rate of the tumor. Mean BrdUrd LI before RT was equal to 8.5% and ranged from 1 to 24.2%. Mean SPF was 22.0% and ranged from 3.8 to 49.9%. The proportion of cells in S-phase as estimated by the DNA content overestimates the labeling index determined by the uptake of BrdUrd. This may be so because the exposure time is quite short and there may be subpopulations in the tumors that are synthesizing DNA at a very slow rate, or there may indeed be cells with an S-phase DNA content that are not synthesizing DNA (as a result of nutrient or oxygen supply, lack of growth factors, inadequate vascularity).

 that rectal tumors are polarized, having the superficial surface toward the lumen of the gut and the other toward deep structures facing totally different environments. Apart from Bergstrom et al., none of the above-mentioned authors gave account of site from where the tumor samples were taken. In each tumor analyzed by us, all the samples were taken from the same region, i.e., the bottom part of the mass.
In our study, pretreatment BrdUrd LI or SPF was not predictive for early clinical and pathologicl tumor response, probably because of different tumor microenvironment. However, BrdUrd LI after/before RT ratio gave information on the different significant biological processes that take place after irradiation, and have impact on cell death like redistribution, repopulation, and reoxygenation.

. That might be why we observed acceleration of proliferation rate in slowly proliferating tumors from 5 weeks after RT (basing on after/before RT BrdUrd LI ratio), which followed temporary reduction of the number of DNA-synthesizing cells, 4–5 weeks after the start of RT. Accelerated proliferation was confirmed by increased S-phase fraction. However, better biological tumor responsiveness of fast proliferating tumors on cellular level did not find confirmation on tissue level that is in surgery because a fewer number of sphincter saving resections were performed in patients with fast (22) than those with slowly proliferating tumors (29).

 indicated that moderately differentiated cancer cells are associated with hematogenous metastases to the liver, and the loss of tubular formation of cancer cells in poorly differentiated tumors may be fundamentally related to lymph node metastases and infiltrative growth. Therefore, particularly in patients with moderately differentiated and slowly proliferating tumors, adjuvant chemotherapy could be suggested after OTT shorter than 4 weeks, to prevent developing metastases to the liver.
In conclusion, our study shows that pretreatment BrdUrd LI or SPF were not predictive for early clinical and pathologic tumor response. After/before BrdUrd LI ratios showed inhibition of proliferation in responsive tumors, but this was not reflected in the number of sphincter preserving procedures performed. As 1 month after RT, accelerated proliferation of tumor cells is observed only in slowly proliferating tumors, we think that longer interval between RT and surgery is inadvisable.
If late tumor response confirms that patients having tumors with increased proliferative activity have statistically significantly less recurrences and improved survival rates compared with patients with less proliferative tumors, then we will be able to suggest a prognostic factor for individual rectal cancer patient, and a basis for selection to postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy.
