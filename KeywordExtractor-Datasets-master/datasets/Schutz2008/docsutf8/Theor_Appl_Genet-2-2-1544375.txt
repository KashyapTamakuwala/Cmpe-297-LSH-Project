). The preclustering algorithm clustered sequences using a Smith Waterman type algorithm with initial word matching. The command line settings for CAP3 were as follows: -e 5000 -p 90 -d 10000 -b 60. The -e, -d and -b options are set such that the assembler disregards them or minimizes their effect. The -p option increases the sequence identity necessary on overlaps to 90 from a default of 75, which were found to be not stringent enough. Sequences were also checked for length, complexity and contamination. The builds were uploaded to the database, where each unigene was assigned a unique unigene ID.

). This close phylogenetic relationship may explain why Unigene 125230 has homologous matches only in these species. Moreover, since Unigene 125230 shows homology to the 2S seed storage proteins in these related species, we conjecture that unigene 125230, its tomato unigene match, the sesame, Brazil nut and sunflower 2S storage protein gene all encode orthologous 2S seed storage proteins. This is the first time that a 2S seed storage protein has been identified in coffee or any Solanaceae species. Finally, a BLAST search of Unigene 125230 against the coffee unigene set revealed additional putative copies of the 2S seed storage protein. However, on close examination, all appear to be splicing variants or low quality sequences. Moreover, southern hybridization with a 2S cDNA probe on genomic DNA confirmed that the 2S gene is single copy in the coffee genome (data not shown).

. A BLAST search of Unigene 120912 against the coffee unigene set revealed additional putative copies of the 11S seed storage protein. However, like the 2s seed storage protein (Unigene 124230), all appears to be results of alternative splicing or low sequence quality. Moreover, southern hybridization with an 11S cDNA probe on genomic DNA confirmed that the 11S gene is single copy in the coffee genome (data not shown).

). Unigene 119817, on the other hand, was found to be exclusively expressed in late stage developing seeds and pericarp tissue. As previously mentioned, early stage cherries contained both pericarp and seed tissues. The fact that Unigene 120685 was not found in the middle and late stages of seed development suggests that this gene may not be expressed in seeds, but rather in the maternally derived pericarp and leaf tissues. Based on these results, one can speculate that these two putative chitinase genes may be involved in pathogen defense in developing CHERRIES, with Unigene 120685 being expressed in early developing, post pollination pericarp and leaf tissues and Unigene 119817 being expressed primarily late in seed development, just prior to maturity.

We speculate that these genes may be related to chemical or morphological features unique to coffee.

Conclusions
Arabidopsis
 and Solanaceous species, we have identified the two major seed storage proteins of coffee (2S and 11S) and demonstrated that these proteins are expressed at different times during seed development. Through in silico gene expression analysis, we have identified a number of highly expressed genes that show high specificity for different stages of seed development as well as for the pericarp tissue that surrounds the seeds. Many of these highly expressed genes are unique to coffee and/or the Asterid clade of higher plants. While the functions of most of these highly expressed, tissue/stage specific genes remain to be determined, the fact that they have been identified points the way to promoters, which can potentially be used to drive gene expression in specific stages/tissues of the coffee plant. Many of these genes are specific to defined periods of seed and/or pericarp development—both critically important for insect/pathogen resistance and in determining the quality of the coffee bean with respect to commercial coffee products.

. These results are consistent with the fact that coffee and solanaceous species share very similar chromosome architecture and are closely related, both belonging to the Asterid I clade of dicot plant family. Moreover, the ability to identify orthologous genes between coffee and tomato opens the door to eventually developing detailed comparative maps for these two species and to the sharing of genomic and biological tools/discoveries—an outcome that should expedite research in both taxa.
