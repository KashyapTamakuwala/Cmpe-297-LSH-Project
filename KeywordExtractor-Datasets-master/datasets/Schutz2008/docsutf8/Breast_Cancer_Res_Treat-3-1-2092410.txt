] with some modifications for optimal results. The fragment pool was designed based on melting profiles and sequence. Electrophoresis was performed in 0.5 TAE buffer at 58°C, 120 V for 16 h for BRCA1 gene, and 55°C, 100 V for 18 h for BRCA2. Gels were stained with ethidium bromide and photographed under a UV transilluminator. The aberrantly migrating samples were re-amplified using sequencing primers and sequencing was performed using Big Dye Cycle-sequencing kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The reaction products were analyzed using an ABI 3100 DNA Sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Torrence, CA, USA) and sequence files were edited using the Bio Edit program. The classification of gene alterations was performed in accordance with the entries in the Breast Cancer Information Core (BIC, Bethesda, MD).

Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA)
20
]. The MLPA test for BRCA1 (P02) and BRCA2 (P45) mutations were obtained from MRC-Holland, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. The fragments were analyzed on an ABI model 310 capillary sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Torrence, CA, USA) using Genescan-TAMRA 500 size standards (Applied Biosystems). Fragment analysis was performed with Genescan software.


Results and discussions
We identified 120 incident Indonesian breast cancer cases diagnosed before the age of 41 years, or having family history of breast cancer, or harboring bilateral breast cancer during September 1999–April 2005 (Jogjakarta) and during July 2004–April 2005 (Jakarta and Denpasar). In addition, 16 of their family members were analyzed.

As the c.2699_2704delTAAATG mutation was found in two unrelated patients, this mutation could be a good candidate as a founder mutation.

]. The intronic UV c.5313–31A>G also deserves further investigation as it may theoretically have an effect on splicing. However, according to splice site finder (http://www.genet.sickkids.on.ca/∼ali/splicesitefinder.html), the splicing sites in the wild type and mutant alleles are similar, so therefore we can suggest that the c.5313–31A>G has no effect on splicing.

 gene is shorter). Therefore, even tough the Leucine to Valine changes may not give any effect on amino acid charge, its conservation in evolution is suggestive of a functional role. Interestingly, p.Gln609Glu and p.Gln699Leu of BRCA2 that result in a quite dramatic amino acid subtitution that might lead to protein structure changes, are only conserved in four and five species respectively. As for the p.Val950Ile, the conservation in evolution is quite low. Although p.Gln609Glu is less conserved, we still believe that Glutamine to Glutamic acid substitution may have an effect on protein conformation as two adjacent acidic amino acids will be formed as the result of the substitution.
Glycosylation moiety of an amino acid also plays a role in protein function. Amino acid substitutions involving Serine, Threonine and Asparagine, should also be checked for their O-GlcNac potential and threshold. Here we have a Threonine to Isoleucine substitution (p.Thr1852Ile) that after checking with YinOYang (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/YinOYang) showed no significant threshold changes between the wildtype and the mutant allele.

Overall, we propose that among the seven novel UVs, there are three mutations that are possibly pathogenic: p.Leu1209Val for its location in a conserved region, and p.Gln609Glu and the p.Gln699Leu because of two adjacent acidic amino acid being formed and a high similarity score, respectively.

Although the number of patients is too small to draw firm conclusions, these data may point to geographic differences within Indonesia.

/2 mutations depends on the population analyzed and on the criteria used to select the patients. Family history of breast cancer was, however, absent or not suggestive of a hereditary predisposition in three-fourth of the deleterious mutations carriers and in more than 90% of UV carriers. This suggests that BRCA screening policies based on family history only would miss a considerable proportion of mutation carriers.

 germline mutations have been found, as well as a variety of novel “unclassified variant” mutations that may therefore be specific for the Indonesian population. It is likely that some of the “unclassified variant” mutations may have a functional role in breast cancer development, which deserves to be explored further.
