Escherichia coli 
is the preferred host system for the heterologous biosynthesis of therapeutic proteins that do not need posttranslational modifications. In this report, the development of a robust high-cell-density fed-batch procedure for the efficient production of a therapeutic hormone is described. The strategy is to guide the process along a predefined profile of the total biomass that was derived from a given specific growth rate profile. This profile might have been built upon experience or derived from numerical process optimization. A surprisingly simple adaptive procedure correcting for deviations from the desired path was developed. In this way the batch-to-batch reproducibility can be drastically improved as compared to the process control strategies typically applied in industry. This applies not only to the biomass but, as the results clearly show, to the product titer also.

Introduction
Biologics are known to be rather complex products. Apparently small changes in the manufacturing processes can cause significant differences in their clinical properties. Hence, production processes for biologics are approved by authorities only with clearly defined constraints on their manufacturing procedures. Consequently, reproducibility is of utmost importance. Additionally, reproducibility is very important as it affects the downstream processing and thus quality of the final product.
From the engineering point of view there are two challenges in guaranteeing batch-to-batch reproducibility. First of all, within the given constraints, the operational procedure, most robust with respect to typically appearing process fluctuations, must be found. And, secondly, while running the process along this robust path, the remaining randomly appearing disturbances must be eliminated by means of feedback control.

 BL21(DE3) as the host cell. The recombinant target protein was coded on the plasmid pET 28a and expressed under the control of the T7 promoter after induction with isopropyl-thiogalactopyranosid (IPTG). The strain was resistant to kanamycin. The product appears as inclusion body within the cytoplasm. The particular strain used did not produce measurable amounts of acetate under the cultivation conditions adjusted in the experiments reported. This was tested in the beginning by means of appropriate test kits.

There is one exception. In the last experiment (S330) feed pump was switched off from 3 to 5 h in order to test the controller performance under process conditions with an extremely hard disturbance. The controller appeared to be robust enough to cope with this disturbance. Again in the end the relative deviation from the mean remained in the 2% interval.

 control also leads to an improved batch-to-batch reproducibility in the product concentration profiles. All profiles stay within the confidence interval of the analytical protein detection method. The relative error of ±15% of target protein analysis by SDS-PAGE was estimated from a fivefold analysis using the same fermentation samples.

]. This is a significant disadvantage from the process quality point of view.
We wished to extend the work on fermentation control towards quality assurance of process and thus product formation. This first of all requires improving the batch-to-batch reproducibility of the processes. There are two motivations for this. First, the product quality in recombinant protein manufacturing processes can be affected by changes in the fermentation operational procedure, hence the authorities link process approval with tight constraints on the process trajectories. Thus, good reproducibility increases product quality. Secondly the downstream processing can work much more efficiently when the cultivation results are highly reproducible. Therefore, having the same culture each time should be beneficial to the overall product yield as well.

) profile is taken as the feed forward component of the process and programmed in the programmable controller at the fermenter. If due to distortion the biomass becomes smaller as expected, the cells will see more substrate than expected and respond temporarily by increasing their growth rate. If, on the other hand, the distortion leads to a higher biomass concentration, the cells see less substrate than expected and reduce their growth rate, thus correcting for their deviation in the total biomass. The feedback component of the process has thus only to correct for larger deviations.

], but will critically depend on the ease of the control algorithm. The algorithm used in this work is an extremely simple adaptive control approach which only corrects the biomass-on-substrate yield in the basic feed rate expression. The control algorithm proved to be stable in many fermentation runs with many different organisms and several different fermenter scales up to the large production scale.
