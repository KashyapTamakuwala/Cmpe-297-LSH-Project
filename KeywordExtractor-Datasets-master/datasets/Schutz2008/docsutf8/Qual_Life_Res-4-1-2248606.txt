 = 227). The proportion of residents that could complete each scale varied. The Depression List could be administered most often to the cognitively most impaired group (43%; Mini Mental State Examination-scores 0–4). In the three cognition groups with MMSE-score >5, internal consistency of the Depression List, Geriatric Depression Scale and Negative Affect Scale was adequate in all three groups (alpha ≥.68). Intercorrelation was highest for the Philadelphia Geriatric Center Morale Scale, the Depression List, and the Geriatric Depression Scale (rho ≥.65). Nonetheless, self-report scales were not strongly correlated with two observational scales for depression, especially in cognitively severely impaired residents (rho ≤.30). In conclusion, it may not be possible to measure overall quality of life through self-report, and possibly also through observation, in many nursing home residents.

]. As the absence of depression does not automatically imply that a resident is happy or content, this poses the question of whether positive and negative scales do, indeed, measure separate constructs and thus, whether or not a negative scale can be used as a single scale for OQOL.
In this paper the aim is to investigate the usefulness of six self-report measurement scales for OQOL, by studying whether they can be administered reliably and validly in a large group of nursing home residents, and whether this is related to cognitive impairment. We hypothesized that if all scales measure OQOL in nursing home patients validly and reliably, they would correlate highly, within all cognition groups. Moreover, the scales should be related to observational scales that measure OQOL.

Methods
Data were collected in ten nursing homes in the Netherlands. The Medical Ethics Committee of the VU University Medical Center had approved the research proposal, and written informed consent was obtained from the participants or their legal representative. Data were collected on a maximum sample of 30 residents over a period of 3 months per nursing home, with an equal distribution of residents with mainly physical handicaps (in so-called ‘somatic’ units) and mainly dementia syndromes (in so-called ‘psychogeriatric’ units).
The principal investigator (DLG, a trained psychologist) administered the self-report OQOL scales and the cognitive test (see later), while the nursing staff carried out the observational assessments. The completeness of the interview data depended on the resident’s cognitive and physical abilities and willingness to answer questions. The scales were administered in random order. The administration of a scale was terminated when a resident proved to be unwilling or unable to respond to the questions that were asked. To assure the validity of cross-sectional comparisons, the self-report and observational scales for each resident were both assessed within the same 4-week period.
Measurement instruments
The scales that were selected to measure OQOL had been used before in published research among nursing home residents or frail elderly populations. A distinction was made between scales that ask about OQOL literally, scales that focus on positive affect, negative affect or life-satisfaction, and scales that indicate clinical depression.
Self-report OQOL scales

]. To our question ‘at the moment’ was added, because a pilot study showed that, without this explicit time-limit, the residents tended to evaluate the whole of their past life. The response scale, which is presented in the form of a card, consists of the following response categories: 1 = bad, 2 = moderate, 3 = good, 4 = very good, and 5 = excellent.

For construct validity, Spearman coefficients for the interrelationships of the self-report OQOL scales and for the relationships of the OQOL scales with the observational scales for OQOL were calculated and compared across the different cognition groups. Significant correlation coefficients are described in the results and interpreted as follows: .21–.40 = fair correlation, .41–.60 = substantial correlation, and .61–.90 = strong correlation.

Each fraction presents the number of residents who completed the scale in relation to the total number of residents who were offered the scale. Because the scales were not offered to all 227 participants, the numbers in the denominators do not add up to 227, and differ for each scale



Due to practical considerations and the frailty of the residents, not all scales were administered to all residents. Therefore, the number of completed scales varied.

As far as the different cognitive groups are concerned, although the correlations between the scales were mostly lowest in the low cognition group, no clear linear trend across cognition groups was visible. The strength of the relationships between the positive PGCMS and the negative NAS, DL and GDS further indicates that these constructs are far from independent, as often has been found.

Discussion

], but refers to shorter scales that only measure OQOL instead of various dimensions of quality of life.
In addition to residents being able to complete a scale, the resulting psychometric properties of the scales are of importance. It appeared that all scales, with the exception of the PAS and, to a lesser extent, the PGCMS, had an acceptable internal consistency. Although the alphas varied across the cognition groups, there was no linear trend of decreasing consistency with increasing cognitive impairment. With regard to validity, the PGCMS, DL and GDS (and the NAS to a lesser extent), were strongly interrelated in all cognition groups, although the correlations in the low cognition group overall were somewhat lower. These four scales also had the strongest relationships with the observational scales for OQOL. However, these relationships were not very strong. Moreover, in the low cognition group the scales were not related to the observational scales. This suggests that level of cognitive impairment has a substantial influence on the validity of self-report OQOL-scales.

]. However, in cognitively impaired residents it is important to use a self-report scale that is as simple as possible, which may lead to loss of information, and therefore a loss of psychometric quality. For instance, the dichotomized response scale and the time-frame of ‘today’ that was used for the PAS and the NAS may have resulted in less discriminatory and lower scores, but increasing the response categories and the time-frame would threaten its reliability. We therefore suggest further research into the optimal time frame and response categories of the NAS.
Although the DL and the GDS have been developed as screening instruments for depression, they correlated very strongly with the PGCMS, which is a scale for life satisfaction. Studying the item content of the scales, it appeared that the items of these three scales have many similarities. The items of the DL and the GDS contain positive as well as negative affects and also contentment (e.g. ‘satisfied’, ‘happy’ and ‘hopeful’). Remarkably, although the PGCMS is considered to be a positive scale, it has more items that contain negative affects or cognitions (12 out of 17; 71%) than the GDS (20 out of 30; 67%), and especially the DL (7 out of 15; 47%). Therefore, despite the fact that the names of the GDS and the DL suggest a negative scale, they both contain ample positive items. Likewise, the PGCMS cannot be considered to be a solely positive scale. So, with adapted scoring methods, each of these scales could be used as a single measure for OQOL, covering both positive and negative aspects.

]. It should also apply a shorter maximum time-interval for collecting observational data than the four week-period used in this study, since this may have resulted in an underestimation of the association between the self-report scales on the one hand and the observational scales on the other.

]. Nevertheless, even if a resident appears to be able to understand the questions, it is not certain that her answers are a true reflection of her inner state. Therefore, further research should focus on developing guidelines on when the administration of a scale can be considered as reliable and valid. This research could, for instance, study the possibility of examining test-retest reliability by repeating questions of a scale throughout the assessment. Such test-retest reliability in the assessment of cognitively impaired residents is an important indication that the resident has understood the questions and that she really communicates her true subjective state. In addition, repeating the assessment on another day and calculating a mean score for the two assessments can result in a more stable self-report OQOL score.
In conclusion, measuring overall quality of life reliably and validly through self-report may not be possible in nursing home residents with at least moderate cognitive impairment. The quality of observational assessment of OQOL may also be lower in cognitively impaired residents. Before drawing definite conclusions about the usefulness of self-report scales, it is necessary to study their reproducibility. Nevertheless, in clinical practice, using self-report scales will provide interesting information on the experience of the residents, and is therefore in itself a valuable addition to observational data. The Depression List is a useful scale in this respect, especially for the assessment of nursing home residents with mild to moderate cognitive impairment.
