Only a limited number of economic evaluations have addressed the costs and benefits of preconception care. In order to persuade health care providers, payers, or purchasers to become actively involved in promoting preconception care, it is important to demonstrate the value of doing so through development of a “business case”. Perceived benefits in terms of organizational reputation and market share can be influential in forming a business case. In addition, it is standard to include an economic analysis of financial costs and benefits from the perspective of the provider practice, payer, or purchaser in a business case. The methods, data needs, and other issues involved with preparing an economic analysis of the likely financial return on investment in preconception care are presented here. This is accompanied by a review or case study of economic evaluations of preconception care for women with recognized diabetes. Although the data are not sufficient to draw firm conclusions, there are indications that such care may yield positive financial benefits to health care organizations through reduction in maternal and infant hospitalizations. More work is needed to establish how costs and economic benefits are distributed among different types of organizations. Also, the optimum methods of delivering preconception care for women with diabetes need to be evaluated. Similar assessments should also be conducted for other forms of preconception care, including comprehensive care.

], in addition to the social and emotional costs incurred by families. A number of additional conditions are associated with serious complications of pregnancy, such as uncontrolled diabetes, hypothyroidism, hypertension, use of alcohol or tobacco, and obesity. The economic burden of most of these conditions in conjunction with pregnancy has been poorly studied but is likely to be enormous.
This paper discusses the potential economic benefits of preconception care due to the prevention of adverse pregnancy outcomes with a focus on the data that would be needed to assess costs and benefits. Currently, the needed data and analyses are largely lacking. In the absence of information about the costs and benefits of comprehensive preconception care, which should ideally include nutritional counseling, evaluation of medications, and family history evaluation and genetic counseling, this paper focuses on principles and methods. Three published studies have analyzed the expected financial benefits from counseling women with diabetes prior to pregnancy. These studies are compared and lessons drawn, with discussion of implications of preconception care for women with other conditions.
In order to argue that preconception care is a “good buy,” its costs and benefits must be assessed from the perspectives of a variety of stakeholders involved in health care services. This paper will first define a “business case” analysis and outline the methods for determining the “return on investment” from the perspective of various health care organizations. Similarities and differences between such an analysis and a standard cost-effectiveness analyses that calculate returns to the health care system as a whole or to society will be explained. Second, the paper reviews the literature on business case analyses from areas other than preconception care. Third, the paper discusses what data sources are available and needed to apply business case methods in preconception care with particular focus on women with diabetes. Finally, the paper draws conclusions about future steps needed to assess the business case for preconception care.

In addition to financial returns, such as cost savings or cost avoidance, a business case can be based on perceived strategic advantages such as enhanced organizational reputation, market positioning, or increased employee and customer satisfaction. This paper focuses just on financial business case analyses.

business case
 for a health care improvement intervention exists if the entity that invests in the intervention realizes a financial return on its investment in a reasonable time frame, using a reasonable rate of discounting. This may be realized as “bankable dollars” (profit), a reduction in losses for a given program or population, or avoided costs. In addition, a business case may exist if the investing entity believes that a positive indirect effect on organizational function and sustainability will accrue within a reasonable time frame.

Although business case analyses by definition focus on businesses, they are relevant to other stakeholders as well. In particular, the consumer perspective is also important to keep in mind. If consumers do not consider a service such as preconception care to provide good value for their investment of time and money, low demand and utilization could render the business case unfavorable. Further, government agencies must meet budgets, and the short term financial impact of policy changes may influence funding decisions. In the long run, though, public health programs are expected to optimize population health subject to resource availability, which requires analysis of both short-term and long-term health outcomes and economic consequences.

A financial analysis of a business case can be viewed as a CBA conducted from the perspective of an individual firm or organization. One important distinction between financial analyses and standard economic evaluations is that the latter are supposed to reflect the opportunity cost or value of resources from a societal perspective whereas a financial analysis considers the direct monetary or budgetary impact to a specific organization.

]. For a business case analysis employing a short time horizon, long-term future costs or benefits may not need to be counted or discounted. In the short run, when ROI analysis does employ discounting, the discount rate should reflect the opportunity cost of capital in the private sector or individual firm.

Economic analyses of preconception care
Preventive services and screenings offered to women who expect to become pregnant in the near future;

Interconception care for women who have given birth and intend to bear another child at some point in the future;

Counseling about the impact of pre-existing health risks or conditions for affected women of childbearing age and their impact on pregnancy outcomes.

]. If multivitamins containing folic acid were targeted instead to women intending pregnancy, supplementation might be cost saving. On the other hand, because most of the averted costs of caring for children with spina bifida occur years in the future and are shared by multiple payers, this type of analysis cannot be used to calculate the business case for folic acid supplementation strategies.
31

34
]. Thus, in the case of maternal diabetes, randomized trial data confirm the findings of numerous observational studies that control of diabetes prior to pregnancy results in dramatically fewer birth defects.
35
37
]. All reported calculations of net short-term economic benefit based on reduced costs of maternal and neonatal hospitalizations and did not take into account long-term averted costs of care associated with the prevention of birth defects. Although the analyses were not developed as business case analyses, the focus on short-term costs and benefits is consistent with that approach. Regrettably, the lack of common metrics of cost and health outcomes makes it difficult to make direct comparisons of assumptions and findings of the three studies.
35
]. The preconception visits were projected to cost $2,638 per enrollee in 1989 dollars. The investigators calculated that reduced maternal and infant hospitalizations would result in net benefits of $1,720 per enrollee. The majority of the hospitalization cost savings were projected to result from an 8-fold reduction in major congenital malformations, from 3.2 to 0.4%. Using the cost of the intervention as the denominator, the benefit-cost ratio from the health care system perspective can be calculated to be 1.6. This means that, on average, for every $1 spent on the program, reduced hospitalization costs of $1.60 would be expected. Although the projected percentage reduction in major malformations appears high relative to the literature, the projected intervention cost was also rather high, since it is uncertain that 20 visits would be needed for preconception care for women with diabetes.
36
]. The benefit-cost ratio was 5.19, with reduced maternal and infant hospitalization costs of $5.19 observed for each $1 spent on the program. This finding likely contributed to the ongoing funding of the CDAPP. It is difficult to apply these findings to preconception care, though. Only 24 of 102 participants were enrolled in the program prior to 8 weeks of gestation, the time during which major congenital malformations are likely to occur. Although those participants had average charges that were 44% lower than those who enrolled after 8 weeks, women who enrolled in the program prior to conception incurred higher costs per delivery because of the longer time during which services were received and the fact that not all women who enrolled became pregnant. Therefore, positive net financial returns to the component of preconception care were not demonstrated in that study.
37
]. Women in the preconception care group received an additional two outpatient visits on average, at an added cost of $132. The rate of congenital malformation was 4.2% in the preconception care group compared with 13.5% in the prenatal care-only group, a reduction of 69%. The rate of maternal and neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) hospitalizations was 50% lower in the preconception care group. Combining maternal and child hospitalizations, cost savings averaged $34,000 per woman enrolled in both preconception and prenatal care compared to those who received standard prenatal care. Although no information was presented on the distribution of costs in this study, an implication of the findings is that an integrated health plan could likely achieve cost savings by paying for a modest number of preconception care visits for women with type 1 diabetes.

Discussion
35
37
]. Although none of the studies involved randomized assignment, the relative differences in frequencies of birth defects are consistent with findings from other studies and increase the confidence that can be placed in the estimates of cost reductions. None of the studies indicate who was expected to bear the costs of counseling or the magnitude of cost savings to specific stakeholders. The studies are all based on relatively old data; newer studies with more complete accounting of costs would be more informative. Furthermore, determination of the optimal number and cost of preconception visits is essential.

Better data are needed to establish the business case for preconception care. Although benefits of preconception care can be projected, data derived from the evaluation of actual preconception care initiatives are needed to make a compelling business case. Further, observational data comparing pregnancy outcomes among women who choose to use preconception care and those who do not are subject to biases due to non-randomized study design. A business case analysis of interventions with both demonstrated efficacy (works if followed) and effectiveness (behaviors are actually changed and lead to improved outcomes) is likely to be more persuasive. In order to develop a compelling business case for preconception care, studies of preconception care interventions accompanied by rigorous evaluations with randomized or matched groups of controls are required.
24
]. Easily accessible or extant data sets typically do not allow one to calculate costs from the perspective of an individual organization. This requires quantifying actual reimbursements, co-pays, deductibles, etc., rather than using standard charges for a clinic visit. It also requires tracking which patients are covered by different health plans and patterns of enrollment and disenrollment.

Conclusion and the way forward
Research demonstrating the effectiveness and financial returns to investments in preconception care is necessary to make a financial business case for preconception care. In particular, the only economic evaluations that have been published to date have been of specific components of preconception care, such as counseling women with diabetes or promoting preconception use of folic acid supplements. Evaluations of the costs and benefits of different “bundles” of preconception care services or comprehensive preconception care are needed. Further, such evaluations must include payer-specific cost data to be relevant to framing the business case for preconception care.

24
]. Controlled evaluations of preconception care need to be accompanied by financial analyses to help make the business case for providing and paying for such services. Better quality evidence of both the financial and health costs of poor pregnancy outcomes and the benefits from preconception and early prenatal care is needed to provide a compelling business case.
