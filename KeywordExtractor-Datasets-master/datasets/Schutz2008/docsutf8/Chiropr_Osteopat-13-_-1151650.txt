Background
Obesity as a causal factor for low back pain has been controversial with no definitive answer to this date. The objective of this study was to determine whether obesity is associated with low back pain. In addition this paper aims to provide a step-by-step guide for chiropractors and osteopaths on how to ask and answer a clinical question using the literature.

Methods
A literature review using the MEDLINE search engine using the keywords "obesity", "low back pain", "body mass index" "BMI" and "osteoarthritis" from years 1990 to 2004 was utilised. The method employed is similar to that utilised by evidence-based practice advocates.

Results
The available data at this time is controversial with no clear-cut evidence connecting low back pain with obesity.

Conclusion
There is a lack of a clear dose-response relationship between body mass index (BMI) and low back pain. Further, studies on the relationship between obesity and related lumbar osteoarthritis, knee pain, and disc herniation are also problematic.There is little doubt that future studies with controlled variables are needed to determine the existence of an unambiguous link, if any.

To date, literature reviews have given conflicting views based on the available data and method of data retrieval. The purpose of this review is to establish, from recent research, if there is a causal link between obesity and the affliction of low back pain. A secondary purpose of this review is to present the concepts of evidence-based practice to aid the chiropractor or osteopath in looking for health-related evidence for their patients who present with obesity.

Methods
A MEDLINE search, from the National Library of Medicine, was used to ascertain pertinent articles between the years 1990 and 2004. The use of keywords "obesity", "body mass index", "BMI" and "low back pain" was used to obtain relevant studies. The references of papers retrieved were also reviewed, as were key texts and references.

Table 1
Steps to asking the answerable question using EBP principles

Step 1: Asking an answerable question

Step 2: Selecting an evidence resource

Step 3: Executing the search strategy

Step 4: Examining the evidence summary

Step 5: Application of the evidence




The first step in this process is "asking an answerable question." In this paper we assume a patient has asked whether being overweight can cause low back pain. Construction of an appropriate answerable question would possibly be "Does an increased BMI cause low back pain?" "Does being overweight create osteoarthritis?" In this way questions can be constructed to allow the practitioner to effectively answer a clinical concern.
Once the answerable question has been constructed the next task is to find an adequate resource. Internet access to the U.S. National Library of Medicine's MEDLINE or PUBMED, these database systems are considered by many experts to be the most up to date data source on medically related topics. The next step is to determine keywords to place in the search engine. From the answerable question(s) it can be appreciated that the initial keywords will be "low back pain", "BMI" and "osteoarthritis." This search constitutes the third step. In initiating the search, one should look for the search engines "limits" area. In this area can one designate an age group (ex: 45 to 60 years), date span of the literature search, (ex: 1998 to 2003), and to select either English language or articles in foreign languages.

It is at this time that the clinician is ready for the final step of applying the evidence. In our example clinical data from the experimental literature may or may not indicate that there is a link between overweight and low back pain.

BMI calculation without benefit of BMI charts
Body Mass Index (BMI) charts and hand held scales are available for individual clinician use. It is, however, unknown to what degree chiropractors or osteopaths use such tools. The following section is designed to aid the clinician with calculating BMI without benefit of chart or hand held scales.

]. This method is often too difficult to calculate for most people. A simpler method for those using the imperial system of measures is to take body weight in pounds × 703/height in inches squared.

Calculation of BMI

150 × 703 = 105450 divided by 72 inches (6 foot) squared.

105450 divided by 5184 (72 × 72) = 20.3 BMI.

 may lead to a further refinement of risk of osteoarthritis and low back pain based solely on BMI.

Limitations of obesity as a risk factor for low back pain
A significant difficulty in ascertaining cause and effect between obesity and low back pain is undoubtedly the term "low back pain" itself. Low back pain is a symptom not a diagnosis. A specific diagnosis, instead of the generalized form of "low back pain" may help separate out the association between LBP and obesity.

). Given these possible diagnoses one can readily appreciate the dilemma in attempting to link obesity with its specificity in measurement to a broad symptom such as low back pain.

Organic pathology (tumor, rheumatoid, endometriosis, arthritic disorders)*

Leg length inequity*

**Disagreement in research as cause of low back symptomology

Morbid obesity?**





OA = osteoarthritis


Another problem is the hypothesis that a person who suffers with continuing bouts of low back pain may be predisposed, due to inactivity or inability to exercise, to gain weight thus increasing their BMI. This hypothesis to our knowledge, has yet to be fully discussed and investigated.


Conclusion
The data for a link between obesity and low back pain appears to be controversial. Yet, this does not adequately address the appropriate therapeutic approach to the obese patient with low back pain. The studies chosen for this review fail to document a definitive causal link between obesity and low back pain. Further research and epidemiologic data is needed to continue the search for a definitive answer.
