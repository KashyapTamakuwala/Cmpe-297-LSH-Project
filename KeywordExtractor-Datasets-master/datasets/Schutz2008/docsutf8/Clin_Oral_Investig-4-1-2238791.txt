In principle, there is agreement about the clinical diagnostic criteria for dental erosion, basically defined as cupping and grooving of the occlusal/incisal surfaces, shallow defects on smooth surfaces located coronal from the enamel–cementum junction with an intact cervical enamel rim and restorations rising above the adjacent tooth surface. This lesion characteristic was established from clinical experience and from observations in a small group of subjects with known exposure to acids rather than from systematic research. Their prevalence is higher in risk groups for dental erosion compared to subjects not particularly exposed to acids, but analytical epidemiological studies on random or cluster samples often fail to find a relation between occurrence or severity of lesions and any aetiological factor. Besides other aspects, this finding might be due to lack of validity with respect to diagnostic criteria. In particular, cupping and grooving might be an effect of abrasion as well as of erosion and their value for the specific diagnosis of erosion must be doubted. Knowledge about the validity of current diagnostic criteria of different forms of tooth wear is incomplete, therefore further research is needed.

]. That is to say, rather than reading off the disease from the patient, a pattern of criteria is projected onto the diagnosed subject which determines the diagnostic procedure and outcome. Following this approach, the diagnostic process, in a first step, is a theoretical concept ordering signs and symptoms to diseases which takes place within the configurative power of the discourses. In whatever discourse the physician acts, the act of clinical diagnosis, in a second step, is classification. The conclusion reached through this process is called “a diagnosis”. From this background, it becomes obvious that the diagnostic process must be accompanied by a recurrent reconsideration of its theoretical concepts and the reevaluation of the criteria used. The latter is what the paper aims to achieve.
The diagnosis of tooth wear in general and erosion in particular is made from its lesion characteristics, from the results of nutritional, medical and occupational analysis, and from dietary records. The diagnostic process can be more differentiated with the individual patient, whereas in field trials it is restricted to the classification of lesion shape.

].
The early signs of erosive tooth wear appear as changes of the optical properties of enamel resulting in a smooth silky–shining glazed surface. When the tissue loss continues, changes in the original morphology occur. On smooth surfaces, convex areas flatten or concavities develop, the width of which clearly exceeds the depth. Lesions are located coronal from the enamel–cementum junction (CEJ) with an intact enamel rim along the gingival margin. On occlusal and incisal surfaces, rounding and cupping of the cusps and grooving of the incisal edges occur, and restorations may rise above the level of the adjacent tooth surfaces. In advanced cases, the whole occlusal morphology disappears.

]. In the case of erosion this would address the question if (a) the diagnostic criteria reflect lesions being an effect of an exposure to acids and (b) if the presence of characteristic signs is concurrent with an acid exposure.

Stafne and Lovestedt presented their observations in subjects with known acid exposure, amongst them 50 patients with frequent consumption of lemon juice. They did not give a concrete description of lesion shape, but attributed hypersensitivity, absence of stain and defects with rounded margins as effect of the action of the acids. Their most important sign of diagnostic value was the presence of fillings projecting above the surface of the tooth. In their publication, a number of clinical images were included, presenting lesions clearly matching current erosion criteria.

] who gave the often cited definition of erosion as being superficial loss of dental hard tissue by a chemical process which does not involve bacteria. He described the clinical signs of chemically-induced tissue loss as usually located to the gingival third of the facial surfaces, possibly also located at proximal surfaces, lesions to appear shallow, disc-shaped, smooth, polished, or scooped out. In contrast to abrasion, he attributed erosive lesions to be located evenly on the left and right side.
It appears noteworthy, that Pindborg, as well as Robinson, ascribed cupping of the cusps, loss of the occlusal morphology or loss of crown height, and incisal grooving to attrition which in their publications was defined as result of mastication.

These observations support the finding that subjects with continuous exposure to acids have a higher rate of lesions with a specific characterisation. This is, however, not enough support for the assumption that, vice versa, subjects presenting with such defects must be exposed to acids.

]. The study included three groups of age matched individuals — randomly selected contemporary subjects, medieval remains and a group of subjects living on raw food diet. From the latter group, extensive information was available on their intake of acid food qualifying their nutrition as rather erosive. For the medieval group, an abrasive nutrition was assumed from knowledge about the general nature of the early medieval diet.

As to the occlusal/incisal surfaces, grooving and cupping was common in all groups even though most often in the medieval group, followed by the raw food group, and the western diet group.
The conclusion from this study was that shallow defects on smooth surfaces might be a valid criterion for dental erosion, whereas cupping, and especially incisal grooving, was common in all groups and therefore not valid for a differential diagnosis.

] are exposed or when the dentine is reached. In the case of erosion, tissue loss is on one hand caused by direct dissolution of mineral but also due to an increased susceptibility of acid softened surfaces to physical wear. In these cases, also a non- or less abrasive bolus could cause similar defects when acting on acid weakened surfaces.
Hence, the occlusal/incisal substance loss observed in individuals prone to dietary acids may be explained as pronounced abrasion/demastication of acid softened surfaces. Therefore, it is questionable if the occlusal morphological criteria used for the diagnosis of occlusal erosion per se are valid.

Conclusion
The validity of current diagnostic criteria for dental erosion has not been systematically studied, even though there is consensus about their definition.
Grooving of incisal surfaces is a common phenomenon and possibly the effect of any physical or chemical impact. It should be considered to abandon grooving of anterior teeth and canines as a clinical criterion for dental erosion.

Shallow defects located coronal from the CEJ may predominantly occur as effect of chronic acid exposure and might be pathogonomic for dental erosion. This assumption is supported by the finding that these types of lesions are not present in ancient remains even in cases of severe wear.

Cupping of cusps is the most uncertain criterion because it can be an effect of abrasion as well as of erosion. In industrialised countries, abrasion is not expected to be a significant factor in young people. Cupping occurring at younger ages can therefore be an effect of erosion. At older ages, however, physical and chemical impacts add up increasingly and cupping will therefore be of little diagnostic value in adults.



These conclusions are drawn from very few studies; therefore systematic research on this issue is needed. Nevertheless, there is enough support for a criticism of current diagnostic criteria particularly in the light of the development of a new index.
