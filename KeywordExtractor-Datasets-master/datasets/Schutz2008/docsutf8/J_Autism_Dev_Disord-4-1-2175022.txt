) as an instrument for screening adult non-mentally retarded patients for ASD. We hypothesised that scores would be higher for an ASD group than for two non-ASD comparison groups; (b) there is “a clinical feeling” that mild ASD symptoms often mix with other disorders (e.g., Obsessive Compulsive Disorder or Schizoid Personality Disorder). Therefore, in patients referred to an ASD expertise-centre, prevalences of Axis I and II comorbid disorders were estimated to test the hypothesis that certain diagnoses are more prevalent among ASD patients than non-ASD patients.

Method
Participants
n
 = 36) consisted of patients referred to the “Autism Team North Netherlands” (ATN). The ATN is the ASD outpatient center of expertise for the three Northern provinces of the Netherlands (1.5 million inhabitants). On a yearly basis, about 80 new adult patients are referred for diagnostic evaluation and (advice for) treatment. Since the ATN is a “third line” center of expertise, all patients were referred by psychiatrists and psychologists, working in the field of adult (but not forensic) psychiatry. Only patients with parents who were able to give the required information were included in the present study. They were 18 years or older, with an estimated IQ higher than 80. Over a span of 10 months from February 2003 through October 2003, 60 eligible patients were asked to participate, of which 35 patients and their parents consented. The patients were randomly assigned to two experienced (child) psychiatrists (CK or EH) for diagnostic assessment.
n
 = 369) consisted of patients from the same region, who were referred in this same period to the general outpatient psychiatric clinic of the University Medical Centre Groningen. This group from the general outpatient clinic (GOC) enabled us to compare the scores on the AQ screening instrument.

Instruments
1966
).
For classification of PDDNOS, the minimal amount of positive DSM-IV criteria was two, of which at least one derived from the social interaction domain. For Asperger’s Disorder at least two items on the social domain and at least one item on the stereotypic domain needed to be present with no early delay of language. For High Functioning Autism at least six items were needed to be present, with at least two items on the social domain and at least one positive item on each of the other two domains, with onset of abnormal functioning before the age of three years.
The reliability of the diagnostic protocol was tested by assessing a series of seven patients simultaneously by two experienced (child) psychiatrists (CK and EH). These independent classifications differed only on one patient (PDDNOS versus non-ASD). The seven patients were not included in the present study, which started after having determined diagnostic reliability.
2001
) The AQ-D was completed by the patient before the clinical procedure started. The investigators were blind to the outcome of AQ-D scores. Internal consistency reliability estimates (Cronbach’s α) for AQ subscales were acceptable for the ASD-group but somewhat on the lower side for the non-ASD groups. Averaged across the five subscales Cronbach’s α was .67 for the ASD group, .62 for the non-ASD group referred to the ATN, and .59 for the GOC group. For the total scale internal consistency reliability was acceptable in all three groups: i.e., .85, .82, and .79, respectively.

). IQ, SCAN and IPDE assessments were done by a psychologist (JB) who was blind to the outcome of the ASD psychiatric diagnosis. JB was formally trained by the Groningen WHO Training Center for administering the SCAN.

Statistical Analysis
Chi-square tests and analyses of variance were conducted to analyze possible differences between the groups.


Results
Fifteen of the 36 patients were diagnosed with ASD. In this ASD-group, 10 patients classified as PDDNOS, 4 patients as Asperger’s Disorder and 1 patient as High Functioning Autism. The number of positive DSM-IV items ranged from 2 to 8, with an average score of 3.8.

). The Japanese authors, like we, reasoned that part of the Japanese patients may have been less severely affected relative to the British patients. They also argued that it is possible that autistic related behavior as assessed by the AQ is more prevalent in the Japanese population than in the British. In the absence of the actual diagnoses of the non-ASD patients in both the British and one of the Dutch samples, it remains difficult to pinpoint why scores between the British and Dutch non-ASD patients (26.2 and 21.8/19.9, respectively) differ. The absence of differences between scores of the AQ-D in the present study suggests that there might be “ASD-like” symptoms, as felt by the patients themselves, present in the non-ASD patients in the ATN-referred group and in the patients of the general outpatient clinic, and revealed by self-report. Indeed, the individuals in the non-ASD group were referred to the ATN for the possible presence of an ASD diagnosis, so ASD-like symptoms must have been voiced by these patients even if these could not be diagnosed as such on the basis of the standardized diagnostic protocol. In sum, although there are still many open questions, for example about differences in scores cross-culturally, the present data suggest that self-report questionnaires are not adequate for differentiating less severe ASD patients from other patient groups. Another study is needed to investigate the merits of an alternative approach to this problem; i.e., a parents/caregivers questionnaire as a screening tool for adult ASD.
2005
). For the Dutch, ATN-referred group, however, we took a systematic approach to diagnosing DSM IV Axis I and II disorders. The results indicated that, except for Psychotic Disorder NOS which was diagnosed in roughly 20% of the non-ASD group and not in the ASD group, there were no significant differences in the pattern of diagnoses between the ASD and non-ASD patients. Possibly, the difference in Psychotic Disorder partly accounts for the referral to the ATN and for the “ASD-like” symptoms in these patients as discussed in the above paragraph. However, the general picture indicated by our data is that clinical accounts of a relatively high prevalence and/or a specific profile of comorbid disorders in the ASD group relative to the non-ASD group could not be confirmed.
There are important limitations to this study, among which is the small number of patients in the ATN-referred group. This major drawback precludes any definite conclusions. Of note is further that the ASD patients in this investigation belonged to the less-severe side of the spectrum. This makes it difficult to compare results with the investigations by Baron-Cohen and collegues. Clinical experience indicates that ASD patients, compared to non-ASD patients, benefit more from treatment by structuring, long-term repetitive treatment, and adaptations of the environment. This may hold even more when comorbid conditions are present. Since the prevalence of patients with less severe ASD is relatively high compared to the more severe ASD categories, efficient and valid screening of this group and charting possible comorbidity is consequently an even more important issue. The present study provided a modest contribution in improving our knowledge in this direction; clearly, much more research is needed.


We are grateful to the Stichting tot Steun VCVGZ in Arnhem for supporting this project. We thank Dr. Baron-Cohen for allowing us to translate the AQ into Dutch.
