The authors examined how principles of auditory grouping relate to intersensory pairing. Two sounds that normally enhance sensitivity on a visual temporal order judgement task (i.e. temporal ventriloquism) were embedded in a sequence of flanker sounds which either had the same or different frequency (Exp. 1), rhythm (Exp. 2), or location (Exp. 3). In all experiments, we found that temporal ventriloquism only occurred when the two capture sounds differed from the flankers, demonstrating that grouping of the sounds in the auditory stream took priority over intersensory pairing. By combining principles of auditory grouping with intersensory pairing, we demonstrate that capture sounds were, counter-intuitively, more effective when their locations differed from that of the lights rather than when they came from the same position as the lights.

). Following this notion, the assignment of information from different modalities to a single multisensory event will be reduced or absent when stimuli are too far apart in space or time, because in that case two objects or events will be perceived rather than a single multimodal one.

). They explored how the ‘bounce illusion’ is affected by contextual auditory information. The bounce illusion is a cross-modal phenomenon in which a ‘collision’ sound presented near the crossover of two moving balls enhances the perception of the balls ‘bouncing’, whereas the absence of the sound results in a ‘streaming’ percept. The authors showed a reduction of the bounce illusion when the sounds were embedded in a sequence of similar sounds, as opposed to when the sounds were flanked by sounds of a different frequency.

). Judgments about which light came first are therefore more accurate if there is a ∼100 ms interval between the sounds and lights rather than when the sounds are presented simultaneously with the lights.
Here we asked what happens if the sounds that capture the onset of the lights are assigned to a stream of other sounds with which they form a well-formed sequence. If auditory grouping takes priority over intersensory pairing, one expects an improvement on the visual TOJ task only if the capture sounds segregate from the auditory stream. Alternatively, though, audio–visual pairing might take priority over auditory grouping in which case observers should improve on the visual TOJ task no matter whether the sounds segregate or not.

), should prevent temporal ventriloquism to occur. When the flankers differed from the capture sounds, stream segregation was more likely to occur in which case the two sounds could possibly interact with the lights and thus improve performance on the visual TOJ task. Other stream segregation cues besides the frequency of the flanker and capture sounds were further explored in Experiment 2 (rhythm) and Experiment 3 (sound location).

Method
Participants
 Thirteen students from Tilburg University were given course credits for their participation. All reported normal hearing and normal or corrected-to-normal seeing. They were tested individually and were unaware of the purpose of the experiment. The experimental procedures were approved by the Institute and were in accordance with Declaration of Helsinki.

b for a schematic set-up). Trials in the ∼0 ms AV interval consisted of a sound sequence of 40 sounds in which the interval between the successive tones was equal to the SOA between the two lights. The lights were presented simultaneously with the 25th and 26th sound. Trials in the ∼100 ms AV-interval consisted of a tone sequence of 15 sounds with the interval between the tones equal to the SOA of the lights plus 200 ms. The two lights were presented in the middle of the temporal gap, ∼100 ms after the 10th and ∼100 ms before the 11th sound.
Design
 The experiment had three within-subjects factors: Frequency of the flanker sounds (same or different frequency as the capture sounds), the AV-interval between the capture sounds and the lights (∼0 or ∼100 ms), and the SOA between the two lights (−75, −60, −45, −30, −15, +15, +30, +45, +60, and +75 ms; with negative values indicating that the lower light was presented first). These factors yielded 40 equi-probable conditions, each presented 20 times for a total of 800 trials (10 blocks of 80 trials each).
Procedure
 Participants sat at a table in a dimly lit and soundproof booth. The fixation light was illuminated at the beginning of the experiment, and participants were instructed to maintain fixation on this central green LED during testing. The participant’s task was to judge whether the lower or the upper LED was presented first. Responses (unspeeded) were made by pressing one of two designated keys with the right thumb (lower light first) or right index (upper light first). Whenever a response was detected, both LEDs were turned off and the next trial started after 2,000 ms. A practice block was included consisting of 16 trials in which the four longest SOAs were presented once in each condition. During practice, participants received verbal feedback (“Correct” or “Wrong”).

It seems therefore likely that segregation of the capture sounds from the flankers was necessary before the capture sounds could interact with the lights. When the capture and flanker sounds were the same, auditory grouping thus took priority over AV pairing.



Experiment 2: Capture and flanker sounds with the same or different rhythm
1990
). It was expected that sounds presented out of rhythm would segregate from the sound sequence, thus enhancing performance on the visual TOJ task. Capture sounds presented in rhythm should not segregate from the auditory stream, and they should thus have no effect on the visual TOJ task.
Method
Participants
 Twenty new students participated.
Stimuli and design
 Stimuli and design were as in Experiment 1, except that the time interval between the capture and flanker sounds was varied rather than their frequency. The auditory stimuli consisted of 5 m s sound bursts presented at 72 dB(A). When the capture sounds were presented in rhythm with the flankers, the same interval between consecutive sounds in the sequence was used as in Experiment 1 (i.e., SOA between the two lights + 2 × AV-interval). When the capture sounds were presented out of rhythm, the interval between the capture and flanker sounds was increased, such that there was a short pause before the first and after the second capture sound. In the ∼0 ms AV-interval condition, the two longer intervals were 8 × SOA of the lights, in the ∼100 ms AV-interval condition they were 17 × SOA of the lights +200 ms.

Experiment 3: Capture and flanker sounds from the same or different location
1990
). In Experiment 3, we therefore varied the location of the capture and flanker sounds. The sounds could emanate either from a central loudspeaker near the two lights, or from a lateral loudspeaker on the far left or far right. If intersensory pairing only occurs when the capture sounds segregate from the flankers, then temporal ventriloquism should be obtained when the locations of the capture and flanker sound differ, but not when they are the same.
2006
), it was shown that there were equal amounts of temporal ventriloquism when the two capture sounds came from the same or a different position as the lights, when the sounds were static or moved, or when the sounds and lights came from the same or opposite sides of fixation. Assuming that these results would be replicated in the present set-up as well, we expected sound location to be unimportant for intersensory pairing. Equal amounts of temporal ventriloquism were therefore expected from segregated sounds presented from the central location (near the lights) and the lateral location (far from the lights).
The notion that sound location matters for auditory grouping, but not for intersensory pairing also lead to a very counter-intuitive prediction. In case flanker sounds were presented near the central lights, there should more temporal ventriloquism by capture sounds presented from a lateral position than from central position, because only the lateral sounds segregate. With central flankers, there should thus be more temporal ventriloquism when the location of the sounds and lights differ, rather then when they are the same.

b). One speaker was located at central location at eye-level and at 90 cm distance (as in Experiments 1 and 2), the other was located on either the far left or the far right (at 90° azimuth). Four within-subjects factors were used: Location of the two capture sounds (central or lateral), Location of the flanker sounds (same or different position as the capture sounds), the AV-interval between the capture sounds and lights (∼0 or ∼100 ms), and the SOA between the two lights (−75 to +75 ms). The 80 conditions were each presented 20 times in 10 blocks of 160 trials each. In half of the blocks, the lateral speaker was on the left, in the other half it was on the right.

General discussion
This study examined how principles of auditory grouping relate to intersensory pairing. Two capture sounds that normally enhance performance on a visual TOJ task (i.e. temporal ventriloquism) were embedded in a sequence of flanker sounds which could differ in frequency (Exp. 1), rhythm (Exp. 2), or location (Exp. 3). In all experiments, we found that temporal ventriloquism only occurred when the capture sounds differed from the flankers, and there was thus no effect when flanker and capture sounds were the same. Presumably, when the capture sounds differ, they segregate from the auditory stream, and only then they can be paired cross-modally with the lights. When the two capture sounds do not differ from the flankers, they are perceptually grouped in an auditory stream, in which case they lose their saliency and cannot interact cross-modally anymore.

). The results also imply that a sound can only be assigned to a single event: it either belongs to the auditory stream, or it is paired with the lights, but it cannot be assigned to both simultaneously. In this respect, it is analogous to many of the well-known ambiguous figure-ground displays (e.g., the Face-Vase illusion or the Necker cube), where it is known that only one interpretation of the scene can be maintained.

). However, these studies always relied on null-effects, which entails the danger that they simply lacked the power to detect any effect of spatial disparity. Participants in previous studies might, for example, not have been able to perceive spatial disparity, or they might have learned to ignore it in the experimental task. Our findings, though, counter these arguments. By combining principles of auditory grouping with intersensory pairing, we were able to create a situation where the capture sounds were actually more effective when their locations differed from that of the lights rather than when they came from the same position as the lights. Within the same experimental situation, we thus demonstrated that sound location mattered for auditory grouping, but not for intersensory pairing. Such a finding makes it highly unlikely that sound location was not perceived or simply ignored. Rather, it becomes more likely that, at least in the temporal ventriloquist situation, commonality in space between sound and vision is not relevant for AV pairing.

). If one accepts that auditory spatial perception evolved for steering vision, but not for deciding whether sound and light belong together, there is no reason why intersensory interactions would require spatial co-localization. Our results therefore have also important implications for designing multimodal devices or creating virtual reality environments, as they show that the brain can, at least in some cases, ignore intersensory discordance in space.
