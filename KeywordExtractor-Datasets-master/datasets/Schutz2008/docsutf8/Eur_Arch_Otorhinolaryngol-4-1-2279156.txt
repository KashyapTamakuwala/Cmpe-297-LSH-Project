Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is known to cause diverse subjective symptoms, in addition to those related to osteitis fibrosa cystica and kidney stones. The treatment of the disease ameliorates the subjective symptoms and improves the patients’ quality of life. In this prospective study, patients undergoing surgery for incidentally detected, mild, asymptomatic PHPT were assessed to determine whether subjective neuropsychological symptoms are improved even in patients with “asymptomatic” PHPT. From October 1995 to March 2004, 25 patients who had one or more neuropsychological symptoms preoperatively and were followed up 1 year after parathyroidectomy were enrolled. The subjective symptoms were identified using questionnaires distributed to patients; eight questions were used to determine the presence or absence of psychoneurological symptoms. Compared to their preoperative status, patients responded that their general health perceptions 1 year after surgery were improved (13 cases, 52%), unchanged (11 cases, 44%), or aggravated (1 case, 4%). There were no statistically significant differences in the patients’ responses before and after surgery with respect to individual neuropsychological symptoms, such as “tiring easily, “forgetfulness,” “decreased concentration,” “depression,” “irritability,” “uneasiness,” and “sleeplessness.” Therefore, subjective neuropsychological symptoms did not improve in otherwise asymptomatic PHPT patients following parathyroidectomy. However, patients’ questionnaire responses may not reflect their actual status as accurately as laboratory examination results. Overall, 52% of patients were subjectively satisfied with surgery; this may result from patients’ expectations of treatment.

] have reported, based on surveys, on the natural history of patients with asymptomatic PHPT who had been conservatively followed up. Some patients reported no signs or symptoms during observation periods of various durations, although some patients developed complications specific to PHPT that required surgery. PHPT has been known to produce diverse subjective symptoms, in addition to those related to osteitis fibrosa cystica and kidney stones. The treatment of the disease ameliorates these symptoms, which improves patients’ quality of life (QOL).
From the clinical standpoint, based on patient self-reporting after surgery, most surgeons have had the impression that parathyroidectomy improves psychological and mental deficits. This prospective study of patients undergoing surgery for incidentally detected, mild, asymptomatic PHPT determined whether subjective neuropsychological symptoms improved postoperatively in patients with asymptomatic PHPT.

Preoperative bone mineral density was measured in the lumbar spine (L2–L4) using a dual-energy X-ray absorptiometer. The serum calcium level was 10.1–12.4 (mean 11.0) mg/dl, the urinary calcium excretion rate was 51–497 (mean 246) mg/24 h, the creatinine clearance rate was 40–183 (mean 90.8) ml/min, and the bone mineral density was 0.2 to −4.8 (mean −2.5) SD.

Discussion
In normal subjects, the serum calcium concentration is always kept within a narrow normal range and plays an important role in the physiological control of neuropsychological functions. In PHPT patients, even in those with the mild form, the abnormally elevated serum calcium concentration returns to the normal level postparathyroidectomy. It has been assumed that some subjective improvement in neuropsychological function must occur following surgery.
In the present prospective study of patients with incidentally detected, mild PHPT, 52% of all patients who had successful parathyroidectomy reported improved general health 1 year after surgery. This result was statistically significant.

]. Okamoto et al. hypothesized that the transient, short-term improvement in symptoms after surgery may have been a consequence of patients’ expectations of treatment.
The results of the present study showed that approximately half of the patients reported improvement in general health perceptions, and there was no statistically significant improvement in any of the individual neuropsychological symptoms. The subjective satisfaction with surgery reported by 52% of our patients may also reflect their expectations of treatment.

 = 1878. Therefore, between 39 and 1,878 patients would be required to have adequate statistical power to determine “whether surgery improves psychoneurological symptoms”. The sample size of the present study was 25 patients, which was too low to determine “whether surgery improves psychoneurological symptoms”. However, the present findings were similar to those of Bollerslev et al.

]. Since there is uncertainty concerning the specificity of subjective symptoms, the NIH conference excluded them from the criteria for parathyroidectomy. Although the present study did not find that subjective neuropsychological symptoms were improved in patients with asymptomatic PHPT following parathyroidectomy, patients’ responses to questionnaires may not reflect their actual status as accurately as laboratory test results, such as the serum calcium level, the urinary calcium excretion rate, the creatinine clearance rate, and bone mineral density.

], and the other three questions dealing with “decreased concentration,” “uneasiness,” and “sleeplessness” are all easily understandable neuropsychological symptoms. To ensure that all patients understood the questions, the meaning of each question was thoroughly explained to the patient prior to surgery; however, 1 year postoperatively, the questionnaires were simply sent by mail to the patients with no further explanations. To allow nonspecific symptoms to be more readily evaluated, simple, quantitative methods are required.

] reported that asymptomatic patients with mild PHPT have more psychological symptoms than normal controls and decreased QOL. In the present study, of the 37 patients who underwent parathyroid surgery for “asymptomatic” PHPT, 34 had one or more neuropsychological symptoms preoperatively, though it was not confirmed that these symptoms were due to the PHPT itself. The results of the survey done 1 year after successful parathyroidectomy did not show any definite improvement in any of the individual neuropsychological symptoms. The main reason for this might be the mild nature of the patients’ PHPT. Two reasons may explain why six patients gave incomplete answers and three patients did not respond to the second questionnaire: the questionnaires were mailed to patients who had stopped visiting the out-patient clinic, and patients may have found the questionnaire bothersome. If the patients had been truly symptomatic, they would have visited our hospital.
