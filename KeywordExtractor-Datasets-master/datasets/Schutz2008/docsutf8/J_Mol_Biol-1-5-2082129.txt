Abstract
While many Type II restriction enzymes are dimers with a single DNA-binding cleft between the subunits, SfiI is a tetramer of identical subunits. Two of its subunits (a dimeric unit) create one DNA-binding cleft, and the other two create a second cleft on the opposite side of the protein. The two clefts bind specific DNA cooperatively to give a complex of SfiI with two recognition sites. This complex is responsible for essentially all of the DNA-cleavage reactions by SfiI: virtually none is due to the complex with one site. The communication between the DNA-binding clefts was examined by disrupting one of the very few polar interactions in the otherwise hydrophobic interface between the dimeric units: a tyrosine hydroxyl was removed by mutation to phenylalanine. The mutant protein remained tetrameric in solution and could bind two DNA sites. But instead of being activated by binding two sites, like wild-type SfiI, it showed maximal activity when bound to a single site and had a lower activity when bound to two sites. This interaction across the dimer interface thus enforces in wild-type SfiI a cooperative transition between inactive and active states in both dimers, but without this interaction as in the mutant protein, a single dimer can undergo the transition to give a stable intermediate with one inactive dimer and one active dimer.

 In this study, we report on the effect of a single amino-acid substitution at the dimer–dimer interface of the SfiI endonuclease, a conservative change from a tyrosine to a phenylalanine that removes just one hydroxyl group per subunit. In contrast to the previous mutants of Bse634I, this mutation yields an enzyme that cleaves DNA with one cognate site more rapidly than DNA with two sites. It thus switches SfiI from an enzyme that is activated by binding two DNA sites to one that shows its maximal activity on binding a single site.

To test this possibility, the hydroxyl moiety from the Tyr68 side chain was removed by using site-directed mutagenesis to replace the tyrosine with phenylalanine to yield the mutant Y68F.

, central lanes). The yields of the three complexes varied with the ratio of the two duplexes in a binomial manner, with the 1:2:1 distribution occurring when the ratio of the concentrations of HEX-21 to HEX-35 was close to 1:1. The same pattern was observed with Y68F.
The intermediate complex, with a mobility in between that with HEX-21 alone and that with HEX-35 alone, must contain one molecule of HEX-21 and one molecule of HEX-35. The complexes with the highest and the lowest mobilities therefore correspond, respectively, to the SfiI tetramer bound to two molecules of HEX-21 and to two molecules of HEX-35. Both Y68F and wt SfiI can thus form complexes that contain two DNA duplexes bound to a tetrameric protein. However, both proteins were saturated at the DNA concentrations used here, so it remains to be determined whether there are any differences in affinity and/or cooperativity between wt and mutant proteins.

 On the other hand, if the DNA-cleavage steps are rate-limiting for Y68F, there will be no burst, and the reaction will proceed instead at the linear steady-state rate from time zero.

(b)). The amount of substrate consumed during the fast phase (about 1.5 nM) was larger than the amount of enzyme in this reaction (0.5 nM), so the fast phase cannot be due to a pre-steady-state burst of product formation stoichiometric with the enzyme. Instead, the fast phase must reflect multiple turnovers of an active form of the enzyme that decays exponentially to a less active form, the latter being responsible for the slow linear phase of the reaction. The initial rate for the utilisation of the one-site plasmid by Y68F, in the fast phase, was about sevenfold faster than its reaction on the two-site plasmid. Moreover, even during the slow linear phase, Y68F gave virtually the same rates on the one-site and two-site plasmids (0.11 and 0.10 mol/mol/min, respectively).

Although these experiments employed different types of DNA substrates—in one case an oligoduplex attached to a coated bead, and in the other case a plasmid in free solution—they still support the view that the fast phase from the reaction of Y68F on the one-site plasmid is due to the enzyme bound to a single site.

DNA binding. Samples in binding buffer contained 5 nM enzyme ((a) wt SfiI; (b) Y68F) and DNA (total concentration 10 nM). The DNA was HEX-21 alone (left-hand lane), HEX-35 alone (right-hand lane) or mixtures of HEX-21 and HEX-35 (central lanes), in ratios varying from 9:1 to 1:9 as indicated. After 30 min at room temperature, the samples were subjected to electrophoresis through polyacrylamide, and the gels were analysed in a PhosphorImager to record the HEX fluorescence. The electrophoretic mobilities of free HEX-21 and free HEX-35 are marked by arrows on the left of the gel. The mobilities of three DNA–protein complexes are also marked by the cartoons on the left: in order of decreasing mobility, the SfiI tetramer bound to two molecules of HEX-35; to one molecule of HEX-35 and one of HEX-21; to two molecules of HEX-21.

 and analysed by electrophoresis through agarose. The amounts of the following forms of DNA were determined: intact SC DNA substrate, red squares; nicked OC DNA, blue circles; linear DNA cut at one SfiI site (LIN), green triangles; average of the two linear products after cutting both SfiI sites (L1 and L2), purple inverted triangles. (c) The reactions contained, in reaction buffer at 30 °C, 5 nM pGB1 and 2 nM enzyme: wt SfiI, red circles; Y68F, blue circles. The reactions were carried out as described above. Only the concentration of the SC substrate is shown.
