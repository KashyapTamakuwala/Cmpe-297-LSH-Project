Cell shrinkage is one of the earliest events during apoptosis. Cell shrinkage also occurs upon hypertonic stress, and previous work has shown that hypertonicity-induced cation channels (HICCs) underlie a highly efficient mechanism of recovery from cell shrinkage, called the regulatory volume increase (RVI), in many cell types. Here, the effects of HICC activation on staurosporine-induced apoptotic volume decrease (AVD) and apoptosis were studied in HeLa cells by means of electronic cell sizing and whole-cell patch-clamp recording. It was found that hypertonic stress reduces staurosporine-induced AVD and cell death (associated with caspase-3/7 activation and DNA fragmentation), and that this effect was actually due to activation of the HICC. On the other hand, staurosporine was found to significantly reduce osmotic HICC activation. It is concluded that AVD and RVI reflect two fundamentally distinct functional modes in terms of the activity and role of the HICC, in a shrunken cell. Our results also demonstrate, for the first time, the ability of the HICC to rescue cells from the process of programmed cell death.

The question is thus raised of how hypertonic stress might interfere with AVD. Would osmotic shrinkage facilitate the process? Or would the activation of HICCs or RVI oppose the induction of apoptosis?

O by adding mannitol under osmometric control (OM802; Vogel, Giessen, Germany). Measurements were performed at room temperature.

Patch-clamp experiments
Membrane currents were recorded in the fast whole-cell mode of the patch-clamp technique using 2 MΩ borosilicate pipettes. Currents were recorded with an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Molecular Devices, Union City, CA), filtered at 5 kHz with a four-pole Bessel filter and digitized at 20 kHz. pClamp 9.02 software (Molecular Devices) was used for control of the pulse protocol, as well as for data acquisition and analysis. Series resistance was <5 MΩ and was compensated (by 70–80%) to minimize voltage errors. In the experiments, voltage ramps from −80 to +20 mV and of 1 s duration were applied every 10 s; holding voltage was −30 mV.

Monitoring apoptotic cell death
Cell viability and caspase-3/7 activity were determined by use of a calorimetric MTT assay (Cell Counting Kit-8; Dojindo, Kumamoto, Japan) and a fluorometric probe (Apo-ONE Homogeneous Caspase-3/7 Assay; Promega, Madison, WI), respectively.

. The cytoplasmic (DNA containing) fraction was then transferred to streptavidin-coated microtiter plates that had been incubated with a biotinylated monoclonal anti-histone antibody. Finally, the amount of the fragmented DNA on bound nucleosomes was determined with a peroxidase-conjugated monoclonal anti-DNA antibody and the substrate ABTS [2,2′-azino-di-(3-ethylbenzthiazoline sulfonate)], which was quantified photometrically at 405 nm. In all measurements, cells were incubated for 6 h at 37°C.

Testing for necrosis and late apoptosis
Necrosis and late apoptosis of cells were quantified fluorometrically on the basis of a propidium iodide staining of nuclei (excitation/emission at 530 nm/620 nm) performed with reference to an overall staining of cells by Hoechst 33342 (excitation/emission at 350 nm/460 nm).

a) could be accounted for as follows: In early-stage apoptosis (say, within 1 h after STS application) the AVD process surpasses the RVI process, which involves HICC activity, whereas in the later stage of apoptosis, the RVI process is suppressed because of inhibition of the HICC by STS.

], it would be interesting to examine the degree to which blockage of the HICC might interfere with the induction of cell death in this system.

Conclusions
Taken together, our results indicate that hypertonic stress caused a significant reduction in the staurosporine (STS)-induced apoptosis of HeLa cells. When analysing the functional interplay between apoptotic volume decrease (AVD) and regulatory volume increase (RVI) through the use of different activation protocols and effective blockers, the activation of hypertonicity-induced cation channels (HICCs) could be identified as the molecular mechanism by which HeLa cells are actually rescued from STS-induced apoptosis in hypertonic conditions. The precise mechanism by which HICC activation inhibits AVD and apoptosis remains to be elucidated.
