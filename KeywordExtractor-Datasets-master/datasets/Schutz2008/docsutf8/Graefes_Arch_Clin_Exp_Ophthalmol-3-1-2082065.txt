Purpose
To investigate the characteristics of dynamic processing in the visual field of patients with age-related maculopathy (ARM) by measuring motion sensitivity, double-pulse resolution (DPR), and critical flicker fusion.

Methods
Fourteen subjects with ARM (18 eyes), 14 age-matched controls (19 eyes), and 7 young controls (8 eyes) served as subjects. Motion contrast thresholds were determined by a four-alternative forced-choice (4 afc) staircase procedure with a modification by Kernbach for presenting a plaid (size = 3.8°) moving within a stationary spatial and temporal Gaussian envelope in one of four directions. Measurements were performed on the horizontal meridian at 10°, 20°, 30°, 40°, and 60° eccentricity. DPR was defined as the minimal temporal gap detectable by the subject using a 9-fold interleaved adaptive procedure, with stimuli positioned on concentric rings at 5°, 10°, and 20° eccentricity on the principal and oblique meridians. Critical flicker fusion thresholds (CFF) and the Lanthony D-15 color vision test were applied foveally, and the subjects were free to use their fovea or whatever retinal area they needed to use instead, due to their retinal lesions caused by ARM. All measurements were performed under photopic conditions.

Conclusions

In summary, the results of these studies show age-related as well as ARM-related functional loss of dynamic processing. However, whether the loss is confined to the macula has not been definitively answered. A further question is whether a loss outside the macula is specific to temporal resolution or whether other temporal aspects of retinal processing, such as motion sensitivity, can also be affected beyond the macula in patients suffering from ARM. Furthermore, we asked whether the impairment is confined to the magnocellular system or also involves the parvocellular pathway.

; wave length 655 nm) on a white background in a tubular viewer. Thresholds were determined by the method of limits, i.e. the frequency of the flickering light is increased until permanent light is perceived and is then decreased until the light is once again perceived as flickering.
The subject indicated the perceived changes by a keystroke whereupon the critical frequency was recorded. The separate arithmetic means of the critical frequencies determined in the ascending and descending series are referred to as fusion frequency and flicker frequency, respectively. Each test cycle consisted of five training cycles, immediately followed by eight measurement cycles. For further analysis, the mean of the fusion frequency and the flicker frequency was calculated for each subject, which is referred to as the critical flicker fusion frequency (CFF).

All subjects with ARM and the age-matched control group provided an up-to-date medical statement from an ophthalmologist, which appraised the condition of the retina and excluded other eye diseases (e.g. glaucoma, secondary cataract). All subjects were examined by their ophthalmologist with respect to clarity of the optical media, and none of them showed any evidence of changes in the visual pathways.
The complete examination (including the initial interview) took approximately 3 hours.

]. This phenomenon plays a well-known role in glaucoma which often goes unnoticed by the patient. Thus, the fact that patients do not complain about deficits in peripheral motion perception might lead the practitioner not to examine this retinal region in detail. Yet, practical consequences have to be considered. If diminished sensitivity to motion raises the possibility that a patient’s transient attention might not be attracted to a moving stimulus, a behaviorally valuable eye movement may not be performed and a potentially hazardous situation may not be recognized.

]. They found that only few subjects with early ARM developed disease-related effects in this region when examined with standard clinical tests.

Double-pulse resolution (DPR) and critical flicker fusion (CFF)
The results of DPR revealed distinct and statistically significant differences between the ARM group and age-matched controls up to 20° eccentricity. Furthermore, the increased foveal thresholds of double-pulse resolution in subjects with ARM parallel the elevated foveal CFF thresholds, which also show a dependency on age and a significant increase in subjects with ARM.

] who used a large homogeneous test field (18° diameter) that covered visual field regions with pronounced differences in functional characteristics.
The fact that reduced dynamic performance in our patients was found for two quite different methods of measurement emphasizes the presence of impaired temporal vision performance far beyond the macula and suggests a common underlying pathogenesis.

Color vision
31
]. To simply find out whether color perception is intact, it is legitimate to use the color vision test foveally, or to allow the subjects to use the retinal area that serves them best. A (seemingly self-evident) conclusion that the deficits reported here may be caused by a specific damage to the M system can thus be rejected. Impaired color vision, as found here, shows that the P system is also affected.

The growing possibilities for mobility of the elder generation with age-related visual impairment require examinations that take into account seniors’ new lifestyles and can help ensure safe navigation.
