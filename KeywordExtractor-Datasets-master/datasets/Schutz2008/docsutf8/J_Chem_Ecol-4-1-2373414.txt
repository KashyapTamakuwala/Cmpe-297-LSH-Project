)-configuration nor the position of the double-bond nor the size of the acid moiety are critical for the EFN-inducing effect. Our result is not consistent with previous concepts that postulate reactive electrophile species (Michael-acceptor-systems) for defense-induction in Arabidopsis. Instead, we postulate that physicochemical processes, including interactions with odorant binding proteins and resulting in changes in transmembrane potentials, can underlie VOCs-mediated signaling processes.

) to calculate the total amount of soluble solids secreted, which in the case of lima bean EFN are mainly glucose, fructose, and sucrose. Leaves were then collected and dried to calculate EFN secretion as soluble solids secreted per gram leaf dry mass and per 24 h. Plants to which Lanolin paste without any compound added had been applied served as controls (Lanolin control, LC). Per day, two groups each comprising all 11 treatments were investigated, and in total eight plants per treatment were used.

). EFN responds to a comparably wide variety of structures, and slight changes in the molecular structure gradually alter the induction effect. This observation is best explained by a comparably simple physicochemical process, whose detailed nature remains to be elucidated.
How can signals evolve that apparently lack chemical specificity? The answer might be simply that plants seldom are exposed to GLVs or chemically related compounds that are not released from attacked plants. In evolutionary terms, the probability of this situation was probably too low to cause any selection towards a more specific signal perception.
