NAME), a non-isozyme selective inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase (NOS), had no effect on neurite outgrowth induced by guanosine. Neither nNOS (the constitutive isoform), nor iNOS (the inducible isoform) were expressed in undifferentiated PC12 cells, or under these treatment conditions. These data imply that NO does not mediate the neuritogenic effect of guanosine. Zinc protoporphyrin-IX, an inhibitor of heme oxygenase (HO), reduced guanosine-dependent neurite outgrowth but did not attenuate the effect of NGF. The addition of guanosine plus NGF significantly increased the expression of HO-1, the inducible isozyme of HO, after 12 h. These data demonstrate that guanosine enhances NGF-dependent neurite outgrowth by first activating the constitutive isozyme HO-2, and then by inducing the expression of HO-1, the enzymes responsible for CO synthesis, thus stimulating sGC and increasing intracellular cGMP.

Together, these data led us to question whether guanosine enhanced NGF-dependent neurite outgrowth is through a mechanism involving cGMP, and if so, whether it was attributable to the stimulation of either NO or CO synthesis.

Cells were then treated with various agents for 0, 6, 12, 24, or 48 h. At the end of the treatment period cells were washed once with PBS and then harvested at 4 °C using a lysis buffer (25 µM Tris/HCl pH 7.4, 10 µM NaCl, 10 µM EDTA, 100 µl/10 ml Tween 20, 10 µM sodium pyrophosphate decahydrate, 10 mM sodium orthovanadate, 5 µg/ml leupeptin, 10 mM glycerophosphate). Cells were disrupted by sonication and aliquots (25 µl) were removed for the determination of protein concentrations using the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay (Pierce, Illinois, USA). Cells lysates were separated on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (PALL, Michigan, USA). Membranes were incubated with a specific primary antibody overnight at 4 °C then were exposed to a secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Positive control peptides for nNOS and iNOS (obtained from Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor. MI) were used as electrophoresis standard. The following antibodies were used: monoclonal antibody to brain NOS (Sigma, dilution: 1:1,000), monoclonal antibody to the inducible NOS (Sigma, dilution: 1:1,000), anti-iNOS/bNOS, goat anti-mouse IgG-HRP (StressGen Biotechnologies, dilution 1:100,000), monoclonal antibody to β-actin (abCAM, dilution: 1:20,000), monoclonal anti-β-actin, goat anti-mouse IgG-HRP (Novus Biological, dilution 1:100,000), monoclonal antibody to HO-1 (StressGen Biotechnologies, dilution 1:2,000), anti-HO-1, goat anti-mouse IgG-HRP (StressGen Biotechnologies, dilution 1:200,000), rabbit polyclonal antibody to HO-2/HO-1 (StressGen Biotechnologies, dilution 1:1,000), anti HO-2/HO-1, goat anti-rabbit IgG-HRP (StressGen Biotechnologies, dilution 1:200,000). Immunocomplexes were then visualized using a chemiluminescence substrate (Sigma-Aldrich). Immunoblots were quantified by densitometric analyses, using the Northern Eclipse program (EPIX). All bands on the immunoblots were normalized to their corresponding β-actin bands prior to statistical analysis.

 cells/well and maintained at 37 °C for 48 h prior to treatments. Cells were placed in a medium containing 3% HI-FCS and 3% HI-HS 12 h before the start of treatments. Cells were then treated with various agents for different times (0, 6, 12, 24, or 48 h). At the end of the treatment period cGMP was extracted and analyzed using a cGMP enzyme immunoassay (EIA) kit (Amersham Biosciences). The assay is based on a competition between unlabeled cGMP in the sample or (standard) and a fixed quantity of peroxidase-labeled cGMP for a limited number of binding sites on a cGMP specific antibody. With fixed amounts of antibody and cGMP-peroxidase conjugate, the amount of bound cGMP-peroxidase conjugate is inversely proportional to the concentration of unlabeled cGMP.

Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was carried out using a two-way ANCOVA, when applicable, or a two-way ANOVA followed by Fischer's LSD test for multiple comparisons.

When LY83583 (10 nM) was added to PC12 cell cultures, it inhibited neurite outgrowth elicited by guanosine plus NGF but had no effect on neurite outgrowth in cultures treated with NGF alone (data not shown). These data support the hypothesis that cGMP plays a role in enhancing the effect of guanosine on NGF-mediated neurite outgrowth. Moreover, since methylene blue at the concentrations used inhibits soluble but not particulate GC, these data imply that guanosine activates sGC.

PC12 cultures were exposed to guanosine alone (300 µM), or NGF alone (40 ng/ml), or to the combination of guanosine plus NGF for 48 h, and NOS expression was determined by Western immunoblot analysis. We analyzed various protein concentrations (5–50 µg/ml) and determined β-actin expression on the same Western immunoblots. Using protein concentrations as high as 50 µg/ml neither nNOS nor iNOS expression could be detected in PC12 cells treated with guanosine, or NGF, or the combination of the two agents. These data indicate that since NOS is not expressed during the first 48 h of treatment, thus NO cannot mediate the effect of guanosine on neurite outgrowth.

Again, statistical analysis revealed no differences in β-actin expression for any of the treatments at the different time points (data not shown), therefore, this was used as a control for normalizing HO-2 protein bands. HO-2 expression was detectable at 0 time in untreated PC12 cells, but none of the treatments had any significant effect on its expression at any time point determined. In the guanosine-treated cells HO-2 expression was elevated slightly at 12 h, but this was not statistically significant.

], we found that neither nNOS nor iNOS isoforms were expressed during the first 48 h of cellular differentiation of PC12 cells. Therefore, NO cannot mediate the neuritogenic effects of guanosine on PC 12 cells during the first 48 h.
Rather than NO, our data indicated that CO might activate sGC in response to guanosine in undifferentiated PC12 cells. The heme oxygenase inhibitor, ZnPP attenuated both the ability of guanosine to enhance NGF-dependent neurite outgrowth, and its ability to increase intracellular cGMP, alone or in the presence of NGF. This led us to conclude that guanosine either activated constitutive HO-2 or induced the expression of either HO-1 and/or the HO-2 isoforms of this enzyme.

] have reported increased HO-1 protein by 6–9 h after exposure to NGF, whereas in our study we observed no change in HO-1 protein concentration until 24 h after NGF addition. This discrepancy may be due to a difference in the PC12 cell line, or to the experimental conditions to which the cells were exposed.
56
57
], similar mechanisms may downregulate HO-1 expression in PC12 cells at the 6-h time point. As the guanosine-stimulated calcium increases are rapid and transient, at later time points (12–24 h) other intracellular pathways, such as the MAPK and PI-3 kinase pathways are activated, and these are known to promote HO-1 gene expression. Most likely, by 48 h these pathways are no longer activated.

]. Since guanosine, via its putative receptor may also stimulate these intracellular pathways, HO-1 expression in PC12 cells may be regulated by similar mechanisms.
Guanosine plus NGF in combination induce HO-1 expression to a similar extent than NGF alone at 6, 12 and 24 h. At 48 h, however the effect of guanosine plus NGF on HO-1 expression is comparable to that of control and lower than NGF alone. Since the mechanisms that induce HO-1 expression are complex, the roles played by guanosine and NGF, and the time course of these effects are unclear. We have shown, however that guanosine alone is insufficient to cause major neurite outgrowth. It does however enhance the NGF-induced neuritogenesis. Neuritogenesis is not solely due to HO-1 expression. Either HO-1 or HO-2 could be responsible for these early events since ZnPP, a non-selective HO inhibitor reduces the concentration of cGMP elicited by guanosine or guanosine plus NGF by 12 h.
18
20
]. Induction of the HO-1 gene by these pathways seems to override the inhibitory effect of guanosine on HO-1 expression. HO-1 expression at 12 and 24 h is upregulated to a similar extent by guanosine alone, or by NGF alone or by guanosine plus NGF, so there is no additive effect of the combination treatment. As the mechanisms involved in HO-1 gene induction are complex and not clearly defined, our results suggest that the activation of these processes by the three treatments is comparable.

Since HO-1 expression in the guanosine treated cells was not observed until 24 h, and since neither iNOS nor nNOS was detectable at these times, our data is most parsimoniously explained by activation of HO-2.
Although we have not determined HO-2 activity, we have shown, using Western immunoblot analysis that this isozyme is expressed in PC12 cells constitutively, throughout the time course of the experiment (from 0 to 48 h) during all treatment conditions.
