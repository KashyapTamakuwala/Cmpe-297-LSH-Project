Abstract
p53 and tau are both associated with neurodegenerative disorders. Here, we show by Western blotting that p53 is upregulated approximately 2-fold in the superior temporal gyrus of Alzheimer's patients compared to healthy elderly control subjects. Moreover, p53 was found to induce phosphorylation of human 2N4R tau at the tau-1/AT8 epitope in HEK293a cells. Confocal microscopy revealed that tau and p53 were spatially separated intracellularly. Tau was found in the cytoskeletal compartment, whilst p53 was located in the nucleus, indicating that the effects of p53 on tau phosphorylation are indirect. Collectively, these findings have ramifications for neuronal death associated with Alzheimer's disease and other tauopathies.

For tau phosphorylation experiments HEK293a cells plated in a 6 well plate were transfected with OptiMEM (100 μl) containing FuGene 6 (5 μl) and cDNA constructs (500 ng of each) encoding human 2N4R tau independently or in combination with p53. Cells lysates were harvested 24 h after transfection. Western blotting was performed using the following primary antibodies; rabbit anti-total tau (1:10,000), mouse anti-phospho-Ser199/Ser202/Thr205 (tau-1, 1:1000), mouse-anti-phospho-Ser202/Thr205 (AT8, 1:500), mouse anti-phospho-Ser396/Ser404 (PHF-1) (1:1000) or mouse anti-phospho-Thr181 (AT270, 1:1000) according to standard protocols with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies and enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham Pharmacia, UK). To ensure equal loading membranes were reprobed with mouse anti-β actin. All experiments were performed in triplicate.
For sub-cellular localisation experiments HEK293a cells were transfected with human 2N4R tau independently or in combination with p53 as described above. The following day the cells were fixed in ice-cold methanol and stained according to standard protocols. Cells were incubated with rabbit anti-total tau (1:500) or mouse anti-p53 (1:250) before being incubated with the appropriate fluorescent secondary antibody (1:200). Nuclei were counter-stained with Hoescht 33342. Immunofluorescence was captured using a Zeiss LSM510 meta-confocal microscope. All experiments were performed in triplicate; therefore, figures shown are representative of a single experiment.

Appropriate amounts of empty vector DNA were included where necessary to maintain constant DNA concentrations. Twenty-four hours post-transfection the firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were sequentially measured using Dual-Glo reagents (Promega, UK) in a Wallac Trilux 1450 Luminometer (Perkin-Elmer, UK). Firefly values were divided by the Renilla value from the same well to control for non-specific effects. Data for each set of four replica transfections was averaged, the control in each set normalized to 1 and data presented as fold increases over control. Each assay was repeated three times.

. Thus, p53 seems to play a pivotal role in AD, implying that modulation of cell death pathways might be of therapeutic benefit in AD and indeed in other age related neurological disorders.
