 experiments, that raloxifene does not inhibit etoposide-induced apoptosis of rat calvarial osteoblasts; but no clinical studies have examined the effect of raloxifene on osteocyte apoptosis in postmenopausal women.
In this study, we investigated whether treatment of postmenopausal women with raloxifene for 2 years would change osteocyte survival in trabecular bone and whether the level of osteocyte apoptosis would be associated with the level of bone remodeling.

Study Outline

]. Briefly, 7,705 women were at least 2 years postmenopausal and had osteoporosis as defined by a BMD of at least 2.5 standard deviations (SDs) below the young adult mean and/or one or more vertebral fractures. They were randomly assigned to one of the following three treatment groups: placebo, 60 mg/day raloxifene, and 120 mg/day raloxifene. Additionally, all women received daily vitamin D (400–600 IU) and calcium (500 mg). Among the exclusion criteria for this study were the use of androgen, calcitonin, or bisphosphonates within the previous 6 months; oral estrogen within the previous 2 months; fluoride therapy for more than 3 months during the previous 2 years; or systemic glucocorticoid therapy for more than 1 month within the past year. During the study the women received no therapy with respect to their osteoporosis other than the study drugs. The use of other prescription drugs and over-the-counter drugs such as sedatives, antibiotics, and paracetamol was equally distributed in the placebo and raloxifene groups.
In this study, bone biopsies were obtained at baseline and after 2 years from 26 women who were enrolled in the European centers of the MORE trial. These women were part of the bone histomorphometry substudy of the MORE trial that included 65 women from two centers in the United States and two centers in Europe. Bone biopsies from the other 39 women were not available for sectioning. All women had given their informed consent, and the study was approved by the institutional ethics review boards.
Markers of bone turnover that were measured were serum osteocalcin, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP), and urinary type 1 collagen C-telopeptide corrected for creatinine (CTX-I). Data are from the baseline and 24-month evaluations.

Cell Counting
The identity of the sections was blinded, and they were randomly numbered. In each section, the total trabecular bone area was measured using Osteomeasure software (Osteometrics, Atlanta, GA). In the entire trabecular bone area, the total number of osteocytes, the number of cleaved caspase-3-positive osteocytes, and the number of empty lacunae were counted with x200 magnification. Artefacts, such as areas where bone marrow obscured the trabeculae or where trabeculae were crossed, were avoided. All sections were analyzed by the same investigator.

]. Of the 26 women in this study, 11 received placebo, ten received 60 mg/day raloxifene, and five received 120 mg/day raloxifene. Because the number of women in the 120 mg/day raloxifene group was small and no difference in results between the two raloxifene treatment groups was detected, as tested using the Mann-Whitney signed rank test, data from the two raloxifene groups were combined for further analysis. The average age of the women in the placebo group was 67.9 ± 6.1 years; in the raloxifene group the average age was 67.1 ± 6.7 years.

Discussion
We investigated the effect of treatment with raloxifene for 2 years of postmenopausal osteoporotic women on osteocyte apoptosis as measured by activated caspase-3 immunohistochemistry in iliac crest bone biopsies. Direct comparison of follow-up with baseline in the placebo and raloxifene groups did not show differences in the percent positive osteocytes. This suggests that raloxifene has little or no influence on osteocyte apoptosis. We did find a significant increase in the percentage of empty lacunae at 2 years in the placebo group, while there was no change in the raloxifene group. This lack of accumulation of empty lacunae in the raloxifene group could be the consequence of an inhibitory effect of raloxifene on osteocyte apoptosis. At baseline, histomorphometric indices of bone remodeling were inversely correlated with apoptotic osteocytes but not with empty lacunae. Biochemical markers of bone remodeling were not correlated with apoptotic osteocytes or empty lacunae.

], although remnants of apoptotic cells, such as apoptotic bodies, might exist a little longer. Therefore, the cleaved caspase-3-positive osteocytes that were detected are cells that became apoptotic in the last 16 weeks of the treatment period. Moderate changes due to treatment with raloxifene are probably not detectable in such a short period. Empty lacunae remain in bone until bone remodeling will remove them, and this period is longer then the 16 weeks that an apoptotic osteocyte is detectable.
25
]. This dependence of the level of osteocyte apoptosis on the level of bone remodeling complicates the detection of an effect of a treatment on osteocyte apoptosis if that treatment also has an effect on bone remodeling. In this study, there were no significant effects of raloxifene on bone remodeling parameters both in the placebo group and in the raloxifene group; however, changes in individual women over the 2-year treatment period could have influenced the level of osteocyte apoptosis found at follow-up. This could have obscured detection of a possible effect of raloxifene on osteocyte apoptosis.

] that viable osteocytes inhibit bone remodeling and that lack of viable osteocytes, e.g., near sites of microdamage, attracts bone remodeling. We believe that our results do not contradict this hypothesis. Attraction of osteoclasts by dead osteocytes or by lack of osteocytes is probably a local process. If the occurrence of dead osteocytes and empty lacunae stimulates bone remodeling, the lacunae are more quickly removed and replaced with viable osteocytes.

] have made the distinction between superficial bone and deep bone, i.e., bone at the surface of trabeculae and bone in the center of trabeculae. They postulated that deep bone is remodeled much more slowly than superficial bone. In this study, we did not make a distinction between superficial bone and deep bone, but it is possible that the increase in empty lacunae that we found primarily occurred in deep bone.
Biochemical markers of bone formation and resorption were not correlated with osteocyte apoptosis or with empty lacunae. Biochemical markers reflect bone remodeling in the whole skeleton, both in trabecular bone and in cortical bone. Correlations between such general markers and parameters measured locally in trabecular bone of the iliac crest are possibly more difficult to find.
The major limitation of our study is the small number of patients. The percentage of apoptotic osteocytes varied considerably between individuals, and this makes it difficult to find significant differences between such small groups. The variation was not caused by variation in the method, as shown by the low average standard deviation, indicating that the percentage of apoptotic osteocytes has to be an individual characteristic.

] found in their study in young women who had received gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogue therapy. This could reflect differences in age and in treatment between the two studies.
The number of empty lacunae that we observed could be an overestimation caused by sectioning artefacts or the decalcification step in the immunohistochemistry method. We do not know to what extent this occurs, but this would be equal in all biopsies. Goldner-stained sections showed more sectioning artefacts, and therefore, empty lacunae in these sections were not counted. Inconsistency between the change in percent empty lacunae and empty lacunar density in the placebo group is probably also related to the small number of patients studied.

]. It is conceivable that the weaker effect of raloxifene on bone is related to only a weak antiapoptotic effect or lack of antiapoptotic action. This is, however, difficult to measure in a study with such a small number of subjects. It would be of interest to compare the effects of different antiresorptive treatments on osteocyte apoptosis in larger clinical studies and to compare the mechanisms by which they exert their effect.
In conclusion, we did not find evidence for an effect of raloxifene treatment on osteocyte apoptosis in postmenopausal women, but small effects of raloxifene treatment on osteocyte apoptosis cannot be excluded. The percent of apoptotic osteocytes was dependent on the level of bone remodeling in an individual.
