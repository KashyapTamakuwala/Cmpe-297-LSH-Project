Alpha-satellite DNA (AS) is part of centromeric DNA and could be relevant for centromeric chromatin structure: its repetitive character may generate a specifically ordered nucleosomal arrangement and thereby facilitate kinetochore protein binding and chromatin condensation. Although nucleosomal positioning on some satellite sequences had been shown, including AS from African green monkey (AGM), the sequence-dependent nucleosomal organisation of repetitive AS of this species has so far not been analysed. We therefore studied the positioning of reconstituted nucleosomes on AGM AS tandemly repeated DNA. Enzymatic analysis of nucleosome arrays formed on an AS heptamer as well as the localisation of mononucleosomes on an AS dimer by atomic force microscopy (AFM) showed one major positioning frame, in agreement with earlier results. The occupancy of this site was in the range of 45–50%, in quite good agreement with published in vivo observations. AFM measurements of internucleosomal distances formed on the heptamer indicated that the nucleosomal arrangement is governed by sequence-specific DNA-histone interactions yielding defined internucleosomal distances, which, nevertheless, are not compatible with a uniform phasing of the nucleosomes with the AGM AS repeats.

The AS sequence repeat thus has a profound influence on the nucleosomal arrangement formed by reconstitution on this DNA and also the estimated occupancy of the major site was in a quite good agreement with the earlier in vivo findings.

RI-digestion and the cleavage products were separated on a 1.4% low melting agarose gel to isolate the α2-fragments. These were used for self-ligations at 4°C for 2–4 days using 10 U/μl of T4 ligase. Afterwards, the DNA was ligated with pBluescript-KSII+ and we could obtain clones containing an AS-tetramer (pBluescript-KSII-α4). The α4-insert was used for the next self-ligation step carried out accordingly. This resulted in a clone containing an AS-heptamer (pBluescript-KSII-α7). DNA-sequencing was used to verify the tandem orientation of the AS-repeats.

Nucleosome arrays with 172-α7 and mononucleosomes with 172-α2 were reconstituted by the salt dialysis method. Octamers were mixed with the DNA in 10 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.5; 2 M NaCl and kept at 30°C for 30 min. The mixture was transferred to mini dialysis tubes (Pierce, Rockford, USA) and dialysed against buffers with stepwise decreasing NaCl concentrations at 4°C (1.8, 1.4, 1.0, 0.8, 0.6, 0.4, 0.2 and 0.1 M for 1 h each and 0.005 M over night). The reconstitutions took place at different weight ratios of histone-octamer to DNA, ranging between values of 0.3–1.0. The DNA mass was 0.02 μg/μl.

). Mica modified with poly-L-lysine (PL) served as support for sample immobilisation. Freshly cleaved mica was pre-treated with 30 μl of an aqueous solution of PL (Sigma) at a concentration of 10 μg/ml. After incubation for 30 s, unbound PL was removed by rinsing the mica disc with 4.0 ml of Millipore purified water followed by drying under a nitrogen stream. The chromatin was diluted to concentrations ranging between 0.5 and 2.0 nM (depending on the DNA size) in 10 mM Hepes-NaOH, pH 8.0, supplemented with salt as indicated in Sect. “Results”. Thirty microlitres of the dissolved chromatin solution were placed on the PL-mica. For scanning directly in the adsorption buffer, silicon nitride probes (type NP-S20, Veeco Instruments) were used at drive frequencies of 8.0–9.5 kHz and a set point of 0.3–0.4 V. For scanning in air, the mica disc was washed carefully with 2.0 ml of Millipore water after incubating with the chromatin solution for 1 min. Then, the disc was dried with nitrogen and subsequently scanned using etched silicon probes (type NCH, Nanosensors) at drive frequencies of 280–320 kHz and set point of 2.0–2.2 V. The images were recorded both in solution and in air at a scan diameter of 2 × 2 μm, a scan rate of 1–2 Hz and a resolution of 512 × 512 pixels.

Image analysis
Atomic force microscopy images were flattened and zooms of individual complexes were produced using the Nanoscope IIIa software (version 5.12r3, Veeco Instruments).
Measurements of nucleosomal heights were done with the section analysis tool available in the same software package. This was also used to decide in some critical cases, whether a pair of two closely localised nucleosomes or a single one was present. When the cross-section showed two peaks or clearly a plateau next to a peak, two closely localised nucleosomes were assumed.

b also demonstrates that bacterial cell lines can contain a distribution of different AS repeat numbers centred around one prevailing length. Growing the bacteria for several days showed the stable maintenance of this distribution as well as the prevailing repeat number (data not shown). Preliminary results show that this distribution can be also used to generate successively longer repeats by isolating the largest fragments from gels (not shown).

). The comparison of both sequences shows that multiple positioning in the 172-α7 DNA leads to a higher variation between internucleosomal spacings, which can be due to a higher proportion of nucleosomes positioned out of the main phase and by larger distances between the alternative sites. Apart from this observation, the clear separation of the main and first recurring peaks observed for both sequences indicates clearly the strong sequence-dependence of the nucleosome array formation on repetitive AGM-AS.

This also provides some evidence that drying the arrays did not extensively distort the nucleosome conformation which we attribute to the irreversible trapping of the DNA to the PL-mica so that the nucleosomes become “fixed” after the binding to the surface.

Discussion
Nucleosomal positioning along repetitive AGM AS
We reconstituted nucleosomes with dimers (172-α2) and heptamers (172-α7) of repetitive AGM AS by the salt dialysis method. Enzymatic digestions and atomic force microscopy were used to characterise the nucleosomal organisation along this DNA. The results demonstrate the formation of a well-defined (sequence-dependent) nucleosomal arrangement, essentially similar to the 5S rDNA model system. In the AGM AS arrays, however, the variation in the separation between neighbouring nucleosomes was rather large, and evenly spaced nucleosomes occurred only to a limited extent.

). This may lead to a selective representation of the fraction of phased nucleosomes and obscure deviations thereof. Although this source of error must be taken into account, the similar results for cellular AGM AS chromatin and reconstituted nucleosome arrays indicate similar properties, i.e. at least fractions of the nucleosomes are regularly arranged.

), it may be possible that histones interact preferentially even with parts of the major site. Then, a complete nucleosome assembly could be impeded at the fragment termini due to a lack of sufficient amounts of DNA in the required direction, leading to smaller particles.
