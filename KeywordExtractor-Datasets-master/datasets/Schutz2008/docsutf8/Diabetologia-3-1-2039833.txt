Type 2 diabetes is associated with excessive food intake and a sedentary lifestyle. Local inflammation of white adipose tissue induces cytokine-mediated insulin resistance of adipocytes. This results in enhanced lipolysis within these cells. The fatty acids that are released into the cytosol can be removed by mitochondrial β-oxidation. The flux through this pathway is normally limited by the rate of ADP supply, which in turn is determined by the metabolic activity of the adipocyte. It is expected that the latter does not adapt to an increased rate of lipolysis. We propose that elevated fatty acid concentrations in the cytosol of adipocytes induce mitochondrial uncoupling and thereby allow mitochondria to remove much larger amounts of fatty acids. By this, release of fatty acids out of adipocytes into the circulation is prevented. When the rate of fatty acid release into the cytosol exceeds the β-oxidation capacity, cytosolic fatty acid concentrations increase and induce mitochondrial toxicity. This results in a decrease in β-oxidation capacity and the entry of fatty acids into the circulation. Unless these released fatty acids are removed by mitochondrial oxidation in active muscles, these fatty acids result in ectopic triacylglycerol deposits, induction of insulin resistance, beta cell damage and diabetes. Thiazolidinediones improve mitochondrial function within adipocytes and may in this way alleviate the burden imposed by the excessive fat accumulation associated with the metabolic syndrome. Thus, the number and activity of mitochondria within adipocytes contribute to the threshold at which fatty acids are released into the circulation, leading to insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.

Here we present the concept that removal of fatty acids within white adipocytes by fatty acid-induced uncoupled mitochondrial β-oxidation protects the organism against fatty acid leakage out of adipocytes, thereby preventing fatty acid-induced insulin resistance in liver and muscle and lipotoxicity in pancreatic beta cells. A consequence of this concept is that mitochondrial dysfunction in adipocytes, either inherited or acquired, makes the organism more prone to develop insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.

Mitochondrial uncoupling in adipocytes by fatty acids may protect the organism against fatty acid-induced insulin resistance and lipotoxicity

]. There is no obvious reason why these cells need such a large capacity to produce ATP. We propose that, when uncoupled by fatty acids, these mitochondria prevent the release of fatty acids out of the adipocytes when the antilipolytic action of insulin is attenuated.

]. This could imply that the inclusion of saturated fatty acids in the diet makes mitochondria less prone to uncoupling, resulting in the earlier release of fatty acids, i.e. at a lower fatty acid level.

]. The nucleoside analogues included in HAART inhibit mtDNA polymerase and induce a ∼30–50% reduction in mtDNA content in adipocytes and other tissues. HAART is associated with the redistribution of peripheral fat to the central and other compartments and with an elevated risk of developing the metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes. We see this clinical phenotype as a result of release of fatty acids by peripheral adipocytes, which in turn is due to a decrease in mitochondrial capacity to remove fatty acids. The fatty acids, after entering the circulation, induce insulin resistance and lipotoxicity to pancreatic beta cells and become stored as ectopic triacylglycerol deposits.

]. These genetic factors are likely to result in a decreased capacity of the mitochondria to remove fatty acids through uncoupled β-oxidation. Thereby, a genetic predisposition can lower the threshold for fatty acid release by adipocytes into the circulation and as a result enhance the risk for type 2 diabetes.
Our model of the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus requires experimental verification of several points, and it certainly does not exclude the involvement of additional factors such as the coregulation of whole-body insulin action and insulin secretion through adipokines and the involvement of uncoupling proteins in setting the threshold for fatty acid-induced uncoupling of mitochondria. However, we see the way fatty acids interact with mitochondria in the cytosol of adipocytes as a major initiating event in the disease process leading to the metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes mellitus.
