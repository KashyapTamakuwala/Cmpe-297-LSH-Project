Background
Pneumoperitoneum (PP), as used for laparoscopic procedures, impairs stroke volume, renal blood flow, glomerular filtration rate and urine output. This study investigated whether perioperative fluid management can abolish these negative effects of PP on hemodynamics.

Methods
Twenty-one patients undergoing laparoscopic donor nephrectomy (LDN) were randomized into three groups: group 1 received overnight infusion and received a bolus of colloid before induction of anesthesia, followed by a bolus just before PP; group 2 received overnight infusion and a colloid bolus before anesthesia; group 3 served as controls and received only infusion during operation. All three groups received the same total amount of crystalloids and colloids until nephrectomy. Data analysis of the donor included; mean arterial pressure (MAP), stroke volume (SV), left ventricular ejection time (LVETc), perioperative urine output and renal function measured as the creatinine clearance (CrCl) until one-year post-operative.

Results
SV was significantly higher in group 1 compared to controls for all measurements. In the control group SV significantly decreased after changing from the supine to lateral position whereas there was no change in SV in both pre-hydrated groups. In all groups, MAP decreased after induction of anesthesia, and restored to pre-anesthetic values during PP. CrCl decreased in the control group during PP, but not in the other groups. From two days postoperative, CrCl was comparable between the three study groups.

Conclusion
Overnight infusion and a bolus of colloid just before PP attenuate hemodynamic compromise from PP.

] studied the effect of volume loading on graft function with a crystalloid infusion starting the night before surgery. Early graft function did not differ between ODN and LDN, although the serum creatinine declined earlier, but not significantly, in those receiving kidneys from ODN procedure.
Fasting before operation and induction of anesthesia leads to relative hypovolemia and the goal is therefore to compensate this before PP is started. In this study, we compared three different fluid regimes in LDN patients, in which the effect of pre-hydration together with a bolus of colloids given just before induction of anesthesia and a second one just before inflation of PP on hemodynamics was of special interest.

Induction of anesthesia was performed with propofol (2 mg/kg) after a bolus of sufentanil (0.3 μg/kg). Muscle relaxation was achieved with rocuronium (0.8 mg/kg) and monitored by train-of-four (TOF) guard, a bolus of rocuronium (0.3 mg/kg) was given for three or more twitches. Anesthesia was maintained with propofol by continuous infusion (4–11 mg/kg/h), aiming at a bispectral index between 45 and 55 (BIS monitor; Aspect Medical Systems, Newton, MA, USA), and analgesia was achieved by continuous infusion of sufentanil (0.4 μg/kg/h) until nephrectomy. One hour after the start of operation 20 mg mannitol was given intravenously.

Discussion
This study showed that during LDN preoperative hydration together with a bolus of colloid given before induction of anesthesia and before installation of PP resulted in higher SV and higher urine output compared to a fluid regimen with only an intraoperative aggressive fluid infusion. The second group, which received no bolus of colloid before PP in contrast to group 1, showed a significant reduction in SV after installation of PP. In the control group, LVETc and urine output at the moment of kidney extraction showed significantly lower values compared to both pre-hydration groups. CrCl values six hours after the start of the operation was significantly reduced in the control group compared to preoperative values but not in the two pre-hydrated groups; this difference was reduced two days postoperatively.

). It should, however, be taken into account that the blood flow with this device is measured in the descending aorta, which is around 70% of the total cardiac output. This could influence our measurements if redistribution of flow away from the descending aorta occurs because of elevated IAP and this is more pronounced in hypovolemic patients.
Some other limitations of this study should be noted. In only four patients a MAG3 scan was performed, which provides the distribution of the function from the two kidneys of the donor. In the four measured patients the harvested kidney contributed 43–48% of the total kidney function, these four patients were divided over all three study groups. However because we do not have the data on the other patients, this could have biased our data on postoperative CrCl. Prehydration of the donor patients conform our protocol, started the night before operation, which contradicts fast-track surgery where kidney donor patients are admitted to hospital on the day of surgery. Also these patients can receive adequate pre-hydration, but further research should be done.

]. However, there is a need to ensure adequate hydration status during PP without being overaggressive. First, our fluid regime will be tested in a large prospective study in order to prevent the negative effect of PP on early graft function in the recipient, and to study possible side-effects in the donor.
