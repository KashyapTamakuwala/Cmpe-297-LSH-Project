/l (range, 3.0 to 26.3). CR was achieved in five patients (28%), PR in five (28%), MR in four (22%), and two patients were classified as therapeutic failures (11%). Two additional patients were lost to follow-up. The median time between rituximab therapy and response was 14 weeks (range, 4 to 32). SR was achieved in 12 patients (67%). There were no severe adverse events during rituximab therapy. During follow-up (median, 26 months; range, 12 to 59), no other immunosuppressive drugs were used. In conclusion, rituximab therapy is effective and safe in adult patients with chronic and refractory ITP. Overall response rate achieved is high, long term, and with no risk of adverse events.

This regimen was indicated weekly for four doses after prophylactic application of antipyretic and antihistamine premedication administered 30 min before rituximab infusion (paracetamol, 500 mg, PO; diphenhydramine, 30 mg, PO; and hydrocortisone, 100 mg, IV). Outpatient follow-up was scheduled monthly for 6 months. Long-term follow-up was performed every 2 months.

/l platelets was observed in 55% of the patients (CR = 46%, SR = 35%). The only predictive factor for SR was to achieve CR. Patients who were treated more intensively (more than three different treatments) and those with a longer ITP duration (>10 years from diagnosis) had the worse response. In this study, non-splenectomized patients had a higher early response rate than those splenectomized. Although some of these results are similar to those reported in our study, we believe that contrasting results seen in our study are partially explained by differences in the inclusion and response criteria used, in the evolution time of the disease, and in the number and type of treatments given before rituximab.

 every 6 months could be an alternative for this purpose.
On the other hand, because of the mechanism of action of rituximab and its interference with the immune system, we searched for possible long-term complications associated with its use, namely, neoplasias, chronic infections, or autoimmune diseases. Immune status is a major concern in patients treated with rituximab being the induction of low CD20+ counts and hypogammaglobulinemia (specifically low levels of immunoglobulin M), two previously reported secondary effects. Although we do not have data about these two immunological variables, the lack of severe infectious diseases during the long-term follow-up of our patients allows us to speculate that no severe immune abnormalities were developed in our series. As we previously stated, during the follow-up period, no associated illnesses or pathological phenomena were observed. To our knowledge, this seems to be the first report about the lack of long-term complications associated with rituximab.
In conclusion, rituximab is a long-term, safe, and effective alternative treatment of chronic and refractory ITP patients. Prospective randomized clinical trials are needed to elucidate the efficacy of the drug in comparison to splenectomy in early stages of the disease
