 and Yi-Gan San are also useful in agitation, for they have sedative effects. These herbs and formulations have demonstrated good therapeutic effectiveness but these results need to be compared with those of traditional drugs. Further large multicenter studies should be conducted in order to test the cost-effectiveness of these herbs for AD and the impact in the control of cognitive deterioration.

). The assessment of these drugs through randomized controlled trials should be useful to identify effective products in the treatment of AD.

Methods
Searching at MEDLINE (during April 2006, PubMed), LILACS (Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Literature: 40th edition, May 2001, the last research was performed in April 2006); Cochrane Library (issue 1, 2006); Dissertation Abstract (USA, during April 2006); ADEAR (Alzheimer's Disease Clinical Trials Database, until April 2006); National Research Register (1/2006); Current Controlled trials (the last research was performed in October 2005); PsychINFO Journal Articles (during the year of 2006); relevant web sites; and scanning of reference list of relevant articles. There were no language or publication restrictions.
8
).
Inclusion criteria
: Three investigators independently reviewed all of the articles found. The articles were selected using the criteria listed below:
The studies should be randomized; double-blind and controlled (with a control group and a treatment group).

Studies should establish methodological procedures in the crossover or be conducted at the same time.

In the case of being crossover, a washout period of at least 7 days was required.

9
). The models used were as follows: Mini-mental beginning values between 10 and 26 (initial and mild group) or <10 (initial group).

Clinical trials should last for at least 1 month (4 weeks).

Detailed description of the herbal product used.

Neuropsychiatry symptoms progression should be measured with numerical score using the Assessment Scale (ADAS-noncog, range of score, 0–70), NPI (Neuropsychiatric Inventory, range of score 0–120), Clinical Global impression of change or Behavioral rating scale for Geriatric patients.

The final score should be quantified using a combination of ADL and IADL methodological procedures.


Exclusion criteria
: The herbal product has already been target of a quantified systematic review study. In this case, only the results of the studies will be considered.

All extraction and quality assessments were performed by at least two independent reviewers using standard forms developed for each review. Disagreements were documented and discussed with final decisions made by the principal reviewer.

).
The use of herbal medicines in the treatment of AD should be compared with the pharmacological treatment currently in use. Such studies should include the identification of the active principle in order to improve the validation of the clinical trial. Further large-scale, multicenter studies are necessary to determine the effectiveness of these substances in the cognitive deterioration of AD. Until then, this review provides some evidence of the benefit of Melissa, Salvia, Yi-Gan San and BDW in the treatment of AD.
