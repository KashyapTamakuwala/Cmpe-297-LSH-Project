Introduction

In the observations of the senior author (JVR), patients with solitary involved lymph nodes may achieve good outcomes, and this hypothesis was evaluated in this analysis of a large prospective database. We report herein that the cohort with a solitary node involved had cancer outcomes closer to node-negative disease than other node-positive subgroups, and suggest that this represents a distinct prognostic subgroup.

Patients and Methods
10
11

A subtotal esophagectomy was performed with a sutured anastomosis either in the right thorax (two-stage) or neck (three-stage). All cases underwent a formal abdominal lymphadenectomy and mediastinal lymph node dissection up to and including the subcarinal nodes. Thoracic nodes were submitted separately to abdominal nodes.

Discussion
13
 This large retrospective review of a tertiary center’s experiences over 12 years highlights the importance of lymph node involvement in the prognosis of these tumors. The study shows that the presence of a solitary node, although a significantly negative factor compared with pN0 disease, is associated with significantly improved median and 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival compared with cohorts of patients with greater nodal involvement. The 5-year survival, for instance, was 35% compared with 13 and 8%, respectively, for cohorts with two to three positive nodes and greater than three positive nodes.
3
14
15
 It is acknowledged that variation in lymph node yield may mask stage migration, particularly in a retrospective analysis, but the standardization of lymphadenectomy is likely to minimize the impact of this potential bias.
16
18
19

 at the MD Anderson observed from their analysis that patients with a solitary involved node had better overall and relapse-free survival compared with other nodal groups. Moreover, the 5-year survival outcomes and 2-year relapse-free survival was not significantly different from the node-negative cohort. Although in our series survival figures were better for node-negative patients than patients with a solitary involved node, the overall pattern of outcome data in our series is consistent with the report from the Anderson group, with prognosis in this cohort closer to node-negative than other node-positive subgroups.
The clinical implication of this finding is not clear at this time, but it should, at minimum, encourage a more optimistic view of patients who have a solitary lymph node identified after adequate lymphadenectomy, as approximately 35% of patients with this pathologic stage may be cured. In the future, it is possible that advances in endoscopic US staging, fluorodeoxyglucose PET, and sentinel node assessment may improve pre- and intraoperative assessment of nodal involvement, defining node-negative, solitary involved node and micrometastatic-involved subgroups, and selective lymphadenectomy and minimally invasive approaches may be evaluated in these situations. This demands prospective evaluation, but it may be noteworthy that all involved nodes in the solitary involved node cohort were close to the primary site and may possibly have been identified as sentinel nodes.
In conclusion, this study shows that in a large cohort of patients, lymph node status and the number of lymph nodes positive at the time of surgical resection is directly linked to survival. Extensive nodal involvement is confirmed as carrying a dismal prognosis, but greater optimism is justified where a solitary involved lymph gland defines the pN stage after an adequate lymphadenectomy.
