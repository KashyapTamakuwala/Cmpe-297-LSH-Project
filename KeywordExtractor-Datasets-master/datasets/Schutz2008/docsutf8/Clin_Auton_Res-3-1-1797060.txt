]. However, the relationship between HRR and atherosclerosis in the general population has not been studied using a prospective study design. In a cohort of healthy young adults, we investigated whether slow HRR following a graded exercise treadmill test (GXT) was associated with the presence of coronary artery calcium (CAC), a marker of subclinical atherosclerosis, when assessed 15 years later.

Methods and statistical analysis

]. Beginning in 1985, 5,115 African-American and Caucasian individuals [(African-American (52%) and women (54%)] ages 18–30 were recruited at sites in Birmingham, Alabama; Chicago, Illinois; Minneapolis, Minnesota; and Oakland, California. All participants gave informed consents prior to enrollment.

]. Briefly, using standardized protocols, two scans were obtained for each participant (1–2 minutes apart) using electron beam CT scanners at the Chicago and Oakland sites and multidetector-row CT scanners at the Birmingham and Minneapolis sites. Calcium scores were calculated across each coronary artery and then summed across all the arteries. The final CAC score of positive scans was calculated as the mean of the two CAC scores obtained from each of the scans.

Conclusion
Slower HRR in young adulthood is not associated with the presence of CAC when assessed 15 years later in middle age (average age 40 years). Moreover, mean HRR at baseline did not differ between those with and without measurable CAC at year 15. While previous studies have examined the relationship of HRR with CAD events this study is first to investigate the relationship of HRR with a measure of subclinical atherosclerosis.

] observed slow HRR to be related only to SCD and not death from myocardial infarction. Due to over lapping and discrepancy in clinical end points used in prior HRR studies, it cannot be determined whether slow HRR is associated with atherosclerosis or an increased susceptibility to lethal cardiac arrhythmias.

]. Despite these limitations, our study suggests that slow HRR in young adulthood is not related to subclinical atherosclerosis at middle age, which supports the hypothesis that slow HRR is associated with mechanisms related to cardiac arrhythmia rather than atherosclerosis.
