Since elderly people suffering from dementia want to go on living independently for as long as possible, they need to be able to maintain familiar and learn new practical skills. Although explicit or declarative learning methods are mostly used to train new skills, it is hypothesized that implicit or procedural techniques may be more effective in this population. The present review discusses 23 experimental studies on implicit motor-skill learning in patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD). All studies found intact implicit motor-learning capacities. Subsequently, it is elaborated how these intact learning abilities can be exploited in the patients’ rehabilitation with respect to the variables ‘practice’ and ‘feedback.’ Recommendations for future research are provided, and it is concluded that if training programs are adjusted to specific needs and abilities, older people with AD are well able to (re)learn practical motor skills, which may enhance their autonomy.

). A way to contain these costly effects is by helping older people to stay independent for as long as possible, implying that the elderly must not stop learning. They apply old skills differently or acquire new skills, like learning how to use a walking aid, which gives rise to the following questions: Are demented elderly people able to learn such new skills? And are we, health professionals, able to train them?

The abovementioned studies were all focused on finding the best way to help older people with dementia learn or relearn practical (motor) skills, and although the results are encouraging, the patient samples were always small and it remains unclear how much was learned due to a lack of well-defined performance measures.

) will be discussed more extensively, also in the light of research exploring these variables in AD. The results will be translated into practical instructions for more targeted rehabilitation training programs for this patient group.

Materials and Methods
Computerized searches of the literature using the databases of PubMed and PsycLIT were conducted spanning a 20-year period, from 1985 up to and including 2005. The search terms (any field) used were procedural learning, sequence learning, motor-skill learning, or motor learning in combination with Alzheimer’s disease. Only reports published in English were considered. For inclusion in this review the studies had to meet the following criteria: (a) a clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease based on specified and generally accepted criteria; (b) a procedural task with motor responses; and (c) task performance expressed in time or error measures, and not only in fMRI or other imaging data. Ultimately, 23 studies were included in this review. Three studies will only be discussed in the second part of the review since they explicitly examined the role of feedback and type of practice.

Thus, irrespective of the task used, the studies assessing implicit motor-skill learning in AD we reviewed yielded positive outcomes. Indeed, in their 1997 study, Hirono and colleagues found that patients with mild AD were able to acquire motor and perceptual as well as cognitive skills in various procedural learning tasks.
1997
) attributed the phenomenon to other causes like the complexity of the instructions given or the type of skill to be performed. These factors may differ across tasks, which might explain their finding that the ability to complete one task did not predict the rate of improvement in another task. They conclude that AD patients have a performance deficit and not a generalized deficit in motor learning.

) distinguish two types of practice. In ‘massed practice,’ the greater proportion of the sessions is dedicated to training, while in ‘distributed practice’ the duration of rest equals or is greater than that of practice. To date, the effects of alternating these two training methods in the generally older AD patient group still requires further investigation.
1988
). For example, learning to drive a car can be easily divided into the components “learning to shift gear” and “learning to steer,” which can be trained individually. Learning to reach and grasp an item, on the other hand, does not lend itself well for phased training since reaching and grasping are integral components of a single, continuous movement.

) show that AD patients learn best under constant practice conditions. According to Dick and his 1996 team, humans use their episodic memory of the training trials to accurately perform a task while learning a skill. They suggest that because AD patients experience problems with episodic memory, constant practice is more effective because repeated running of the same motor program does not require an intact episodic memory. The second reason why random practice may be less effective is that other cognitive functions that play a role in random practice, like the ability to switch tasks and divide attention, are affected in AD patients.

However, they do not form the motor schemas needed to successfully achieve a movement when the environmental demands change because they are unable to encode and to store the different types of information about a motor pattern.

) which showed that AD patients could recall preselected (subject-defined) movements more accurately than constrained (experimenter-defined) movements on a linear positioning apparatus. This was explained by the patients’ ability to profit from mental preparation of the movement prior to its execution. Without further systematic investigation, however, it cannot be inferred that the ability to profit from mental preparation also means AD patients will profit from mental practice. More research into the effects of all three practice types in AD is needed.

). Extrinsic feedback can moreover be divided into ‘knowledge of results,’ in which the movement outcome is given in terms of the goal, and ‘knowledge of performance,’ so that the feedback concerns the movement pattern itself (e.g., in a Tossing task: increase the swing of your arm).

). In contrast to that of the normal controls, the patients’ performance did not improve across trials in the restricted-vision condition. In the full-vision condition the patients showed normal learning.
It can be tentatively concluded that for AD patients, constant visual feedback is important in learning motor skills, but more research is needed to confirm this hypothesis. We did not find any studies that were concerned with the frequency of external feedback, and whether knowledge of results and knowledge of performance makes a difference in this patient group. Based on the results cited above, it may be hypothesized that both forms of feedback knowledge probably place too much weight on the cognitive abilities in AD patients and therefore contribute little to successful performance.


Conclusions and Recommendations
People with Alzheimer’s disease are able to implicitly (re)learn motor skills to a certain extent and under specific conditions. The experimental research to date shows preserved implicit motor learning irrespective of the task used. Patients are capable of acquiring motor skills without awareness simply by repeated exposure, although their performances will not reach normal levels. This is expressed in their protracted performance relative to that of unimpaired controls. Moreover, extent of learning will differ depending on the task to be mastered.
2003
). In order to get a satisfactory differential picture of the learning capacities in demented patients, implicit (motor) learning tasks need to be added to the neuropsychological assessment.
1993
). With respect to patients with dementia, apart from the subtype of dementia and its specific neuropsychological syndrome, the training programs should apply the principles that emerge from theories of learning.
The studies we reviewed showed that in (re)learning motor skills, constant, or rather frequent and consistent practice is important in AD patients. This way of learning draws less on episodic memory and other cognitive functions compromised in AD patients. These data also suggest that practice under dual-task conditions should also be avoided.
Because AD patients have difficulty in generalizing the motor skills learned during the sessions, training has to take place in an environment that closely resembles the one in which the skill is going to be used and presumably with tools used by the AD patient in his or her daily life. If, for instance, an AD patient is trained in the use of a microwave, the device used during the training should be the same as the one available in the patient’s household. The amount of training a patient needs will depend on the task being trained. The role of fatigue is also important in this respect. The effects of massed and distributed practice in this generally older patient group need to be addressed in future investigations.
2004
). The type and point in time when external feedback needs to be given and its effect on learning in AD also warrants attention in future research.
In the introduction of our review we asked whether patients with Alzheimer’s disease might have intact motor-skill learning abilities. The answer is twofold. Clearly, AD patients show preserved implicit learning abilities that can be utilized in teaching (motor) skills, yet transfer to other skills is minimal. Accordingly, the professionals delivering the training programs should tailor the contents to the particular needs and abilities of this patient group or the individual patient. When the above guidelines are kept in mind and when our knowledge on this topic are widened, non-pharmacological interventions might contribute significantly in helping elderly people suffering from dementia to keep their autonomy. The extent to which pharmacological intervention may enhance these behavioral mechanisms and foster independent living in AD patients has yet to be determined.
