, Arthrosurface Inc., Franklin, MA, USA) was developed to offer a treatment option among the currently used modalities. It is intended for use as a partial resurfacing device of the femoral condylar surface of the knee when only one compartment is affected by posttraumatic, degenerative disease or necrosis associated with large unstable articular defects with significant subchondral bone exposure.
However, it is unknown if the femoral resurfacing device leads to increased peak contact pressure to the opposing biological structures such as meniscus and articular cartilage of the tibial plateau.

 implantation and defect. Based on the experimental study, biomechanical device safety on opposing structures can be assessed and a guideline might be given to the clinician for prosthetic implantation while avoiding potentially damaging effects.

Materials and methods
Knee joints
A total of eight fresh-frozen knee cadaver specimens (3 pairs, 2 single) were used for data collection in this study. The specimens were obtained from donors, who consented in writing during their lifetime to the use of their body for research and education. The average age of the seven male and one female specimen was 71 years (range 61–81) with an average weight of 71 kg (range 62–85). Specimens were selected after inspection of the medial compartment according to the following criteria: Intact femorotibial cartilage, intact meniscus, and intact collateral and cruciate ligaments. Thirteen specimens were excluded following these criteria. Another six specimens were excluded due to specimen failure during the testing procedure: The reason for exclusion was fracture of the femur or tibial plateau (2 specimens), rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament (2 specimens) or rupture of the patella tendon (2 specimens). All specimen failures were female human cadaver knees.

 implant (Arthrosurface Inc., Franklin, MA, USA) is a contoured articular prosthetic (CAP) unicondylar femoral resurfacing prosthesis consisting of two components, a fixation component and an articular component, that mate together via a taper interlock to provide stable and immobile fixation of the implant and stress-bearing contact at the bone/prosthetic interface. The fixation component is a modified titanium cancellous screw with a tapering distal tip, a full-length cannulation, and a proximal female taper bore. The articular component is a dome-shaped component manufactured of a Cobalt–Chromium–Molybdenum alloy with titanium plasma spray coverage on the underside for bony in-growth. Each diameter comes in a variety of incremental offset sizes which correspond to the superior/inferior and medial/lateral radius of curvatures at the implant site. The size of the implant used in this study was 20 mm in diameter with different offset sizes, matching the individual specimen joint curvature.

Testing protocol
The specimens were aligned using a fixed laser beam to achieve correct alignment in the mechanical axis of the lower limb. The mechanical axis was defined by a line through the center of the head of the artificial hip joint, the center of the knee joint and the center of the hinge joint representing the artificial ankle. For calibration of the sensor the ankle hinge joint was secured with two aluminum plates perpendicular to the ground. Thereby the knee was fixed in full extension. Each sensor was individually preconditioned and calibrated intra-articulary with a two-point calibration method at 700 and 1,500 N according to manufacturer’s guidelines. Definitions of the correct angles of the actual knee position were adjusted with a custom-made goniometer and by the displacement-controlled main rod. During the test cycles the cadaver were sprayed with saline solution to prevent dehydration.

Discussion
The patient aged over 40 years with a full thickness chondral or osteochondral defect reflects a serious problem for the orthopedic surgeon. Considered as being too old for biological repair of the defect, primarily the patients are mostly managed with conservative, non-surgical treatment including weight reduction, physical therapy to increase and support musculature, unloading braces and medications such as NSAID’s, intraarticular injections (Corticosteroids, Hyaluronic acid, etc.) and dietary supplements.

] showed in their biomechanical study, that slightly recessed osteochondral grafts with the highest edge placed flush to neighboring cartilage demonstrated nearly normal contact pressures, whereas elevated angled grafts produced increased contact pressures. Our results confirm the observation concluding that slightly recessed implantation should be considered if flush implantation cannot be accomplished.

]. Although the position of the sensor was accurately secured, a small amount of displacement and crinkling could not be excluded. A certain amount of loss of sensitivity during the different testing conditions and imprecise calibration due to the different surface materials (metal on cartilage, cartilage on cartilage) have to be considered. Some drop of data point was observed at some specimen. However, peak contact values seemed not to be affected. (3) Stable, reproducible ground reaction force in full extension could not be established by the simulator. The quadriceps tendon could not be adequately tensioned in this position. (4) Implantation of the device was performed in the central weight-bearing area. Results might be different for the implantation in different areas of the medial femoral condyle or lateral condyle.

 with flush implantation does not lead to significantly increased peak contact pressure. However, elevated implantation results in significantly increased peak contact pressure and might be biomechanically disadvantageous in an in vivo application. Further research is necessary to evaluate the effects of the prosthetic device on contact pressures after loss of meniscus function and in longer continuous dynamic testing.
