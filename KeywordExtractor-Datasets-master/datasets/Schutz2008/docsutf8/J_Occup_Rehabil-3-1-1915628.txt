]. However, as the study did not contain a control group and only investigated the lasting effects of the intervention for a short follow-up period (4 weeks), further research is needed.
24
] it was hypothesised that 4-weeks myofeedback training including ergonomic counselling would be more effective in reducing pain intensity and disability than the intervention based on ergonomic counselling alone.

Methods and materials
Design and subjects
A randomized controlled trial was performed to assess the effect of 4-weeks Cinderella-based myofeedback training combined with ergonomic counselling (together referred to as Mfb), compared to ergonomic counselling alone (EC), on pain intensity and disability. Measurements were performed prior to intervention but before randomisation (Baseline), immediately after four weeks of intervention (T0), and at three (T3) and six (T6) months after the intervention.

], working for at least 20 hours a week, and reporting perpetuating work-related musculoskeletal complaints in the neck and/or shoulder region for at least 30 days during the last year.
Subjects were excluded when they reported pain in more than 3 body regions, when they suffered from severe arthrosis or joint disorders, when they were using muscle relaxants, or when reporting other complaints in the upper extremity not related to (computer) work.

 = .05). Block randomization was used to assign subjects to either Mfb or EC: When a new group of subjects started the intervention, half of them were assigned to Mfb and half of them were assigned to EC. The study was approved by the local Medical Ethics Committees and all participants gave their informed consent prior to participation.

Interventions
The interventions were provided by three different therapists: One physiotherapist in Sweden and two health scientists in the Netherlands. They were thoroughly trained and practiced together prior to the start of the study to ensure that they would provide as identical interventions as possible. The character of the intervention made blinding of the therapists and the subjects to the intervention impractical. To prevent from information bias, subjects were informed that the aim of the current study was to compare the effects of two interventions and that there was no evidence favouring one of these interventions.
Ergonomic counselling (EC)
28
]. This checklist contains questions to evaluate work tasks, working hours, work load, work station, and working methods. Based on the outcome, possible improvements were discussed with the subject. With regard to the work station, the focus was primarily on modifying the existing work station rather than providing new equipment. The remaining visits were used to further discuss the ergonomic aspects, the consequences of possible ergonomic adjustments etc., according to a manual to guarantee a uniform intervention.

Myofeedback (Mfb)
Subjects randomized to the Mfb group received Cinderella-based myofeedback training on top of EC. A two-channel ambulant myofeedback system combined with a harness incorporating dry surface Electromyography (sEMG) electrodes to enable a stable recording of upper trapezius muscle activity was used. The harness was connected to a sEMG processing and storage device (see Picture 1).

]. Subjects were instructed that they should respond to the feedback by relaxation, which could be reached by slightly depressing the shoulders, or by sitting down quietly with the eyes closed, the hands in the lap while breathing deeply. Another relaxation strategy subjects were instructed was to maximally elevate the shoulders for three seconds to build up muscle tension and then to let loose this tension. This relaxation was anticipated to contribute to recovery of the Cinderella motor units. When there was no adequate response to the feedback, i.e. relaxation, the duration of the feedback signal progressively increased.
Immediately after Baseline, subjects assigned to the Mfb group were given the myofeedback device and they were explained the working mechanism and background of the myofeedback training. Subjects wore the system for four weeks, for at least eight hours a week (distributed over two hours a day and two days a week as a minimum) while performing their regular work. During the weekly visits the sEMG-data from last week were scrutinized and discussed to give the subject insight in their relaxation patterns and to identify possible situations of concern. This procedure was facilitated by means of the diary.

]. Using this as a starting point, a clinically relevant change was defined as a change of ≥10% of the maximum score of 70 of the Pain Disability Index, i.e. ≥7 units of the Pain Disability Index score.
Logistic regression analyses providing Odds Ratios were performed to investigate whether the two intervention groups differed in terms of chances for clinically relevant improvements in pain intensity and disability. Three different models were investigated: Model I represents the crude Odds Ratio describing only the relationship between intervention type and odds for improvement without adjustment for confounding factors. The factors study group and baseline pain intensity/baseline disability were assumed potentially confounding factors. To correct for these factors, two additional models were built as extensions of Model I: Model II incorporates study group as confounding factor, and Model III is an extension of Model II incorporating also the factor baseline pain intensity/baseline disability level. For Models II and III interaction effects were additionally included in the analysis, to study effect modification, but these remained only included when significant. −2 Log Likelihood tests were used to select the best model. Odds Ratios including 95% Confidence Intervals were calculated and presented for each of the models.
Statistical Package for Social Sciences 11.5 was used for statistical testing and alpha was set at .05 for statistical significance.

Immediately after the intervention period about twice as many of the subjects in the Mfb group showed clinically relevant improvements in disability compared to the EC group. This share of subjects increased somewhat in both groups after three months and then showed a small decline after six months where about one third of the subjects of the EC group and half of the Mfb group showed clinically relevant improvements in disability.

Discussion
This randomised controlled trial investigated the effects of 4-weeks ambulant myofeedback training combined with ergonomic counselling in subjects with work-related neck-shoulder complaints relative to ergonomic counselling alone, on pain intensity and disability. The effects were evaluated immediately after the interventions, and at three and six months follow-up. Mean pain intensity and disability levels significantly reduced after both interventions (i.e. Mfb and EC). The effects were clinically relevant in a large part of the subjects: About 30–50% of the subjects showed clinically relevant improvements in pain intensity and/or disability. No difference was found for the effect of the intervention on outcome and after correction for confounding factors subjects in both intervention groups did not differ with regard to chances for clinically relevant improvements in pain intensity and disability.

] reported reduced pain intensity and disability levels. Compared to these studies, baseline pain intensity values were generally lower and the cut-off points for clinically relevant changes were set to higher levels in the current study, but the results indicate a comparable percentage of subjects reporting clinically significant reductions in pain intensity, i.e. between 35 and 50% of the subjects. This consistency in results adds to evidence for the effectiveness of (Cinderella-based) myofeedback training on pain intensity and disability in musculoskeletal neck-shoulder complaints.

54
]. Investigation into the specific working mechanisms of both interventions could clarify this. Finally, initial VAS and disability levels were low in both the Mfb and the EC group, especially in the study group from Sweden. This results in a smaller potential for improvement (floor effect) and as a result a smaller chance for finding differences between the Mfb and EC groups.

] with female computer users above the age of 45, applying the same inclusion criteria as the present study, it was found that in subjects with neck-shoulder complaints the following clinical diagnoses were most prevalent: Trapezius myalgia (38%), tension neck syndrome (17%), and cervicalgia (17%). These diagnoses were found in 60% of the subjects reporting complaints. There were cases with supraspinatus tendinitis, frozen shoulder, and biceps tendinitis, but these were less common. This general pattern of clinical signs is likely to be at hand also in the present study. It could be hypothesised that myofeedback may be particularly relevant and helpful in cases with muscular pain syndromes.
59
] and it is known that changes in knowledge and skills do not necessarily result in a behavioural change. In the Mfb group, the compliance was partly controlled as the number of hours the system was worn was recorded by the system itself, but the compliance to ergonomic knowledge and skills is hard to register objectively. This definitely is a challenge in future occupational intervention studies.
The drop-out rate in the Mfb group was higher than in the EC group (i.e. nine compared to five), which was probably related to the myofeedback system itself. Some subjects found the system inconvenient and disturbing in daily working activities. This may have suppressed the effect of the intervention. Improvement of the current device in terms of usability is therefore required to optimise the myofeedback training.

Conclusions
Four-weeks of intervention significantly reduced pain intensity and disability, and this effect remained after three and six months follow-up. Myofeedback training combined with ergonomic counselling is thus beneficial for female computer workers over the age of 45, reporting pain and disability in the neck-shoulder region but no evidence was found favouring myofeedback training combined with ergonomic counselling over ergonomic counselling alone. Future research may aim at identifying possible subgroups of patients in which the interventions are especially beneficial. This may enhance the efficiency and the effectiveness of the interventions. Finally, as non-specific effects may have interfered with outcome, future studies could include a placebo control group for more insight in the specific effects of ambulant myofeedback training combined with ergonomic counselling.
