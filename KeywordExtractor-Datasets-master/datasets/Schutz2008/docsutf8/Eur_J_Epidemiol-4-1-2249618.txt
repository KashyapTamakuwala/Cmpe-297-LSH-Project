]. We sought to fill this void by studying proportions of BB, statin and ACE inhibitor or ARB use after MI in a large period cross-section of Austrian MI patients.

Methods
Data sources

]. Patients are assigned membership in one of several sickness funds dependent on their type and location of current or former employment. At the time covered by this study, there were 20 sickness funds in Austria; among those, the 9 provincial sickness funds covering more than three quarters of all residents (6.2 Mio. of 8.2 Mio. overall; data from 2004). Most inpatient and outpatient medical services are covered and each service encounter generates a claim to the health care system. Inpatient services are not paid directly by sickness funds, but by a separate entity, which, however, is partly funded by these. Thus, sickness funds are also informed about each encountered inpatient care. Similarly to most western health care systems, datasets provided by hospitals contain diagnosis codes, admission and discharge dates. Access to prescription drugs is equal across sickness funds and all medications that are deemed efficacious by a national panel are reimbursed. The copayment for medicines per package was €4.25 in 2003, €4.35 in 2004 and €4.45 in 2005. Packages of chronic medications usually contain 28, 30, or 50 pills. Sickness fund premiums, other coinsurance and copayments vary slightly, and indigent patients can apply for waiver of the usually modest copayment for prescription drugs. Few medications are subject to prior authorization by the sickness funds. Prescription claims contain a unique identifier for the specific drug, the dose, and the quantity dispensed.

Study population
32
]. Since we were interested in medication use after MI, we generated a uniform outcomes ascertainment window and required all patients to be discharged within 30 days and to have survived for ≥120 days from their initial admission date (=index date). We also excluded those patients whose hospitalization occurred at a non-acute care hospital.

Outcomes: use of recommended medications after myocardial infarction
From all filled prescriptions, we recorded out-of-hospital use of several medications between date of discharge and 120 days after MI admission: aspirin, beta-blockers, statins, and ACE inhibitors or ARBs. We also assessed the total number of distinct medications that patients received among statin, BB, and ACE inhibitor/ARB (minimum 0; maximum 3). Since aspirin was available for a price that was below the amount of the drug copayment (€4.35), it is possible that insurance claims data may lead to under-ascertainment of aspirin use. Thus, we decided to investigate aspirin separately, and only among patients who had their copayment waived based on income grounds. These indigent patients had a clear economic incentive to fill prescriptions for aspirin via the prescription route, thus generating a claim to the sickness fund.

Covariates

-blockers, proton pump inhibitors, sucralfate, antacids), pain medications (including non-steroidal anti inflammatory drugs, selective COX-2 inhibitors, opioids, and others), oral corticosteroids, and several psychoactive drug classes (benzodiazepines or anxiolytics, antidepressants, antipsychotics). We also recorded the number of hospital days during the year prior to the index date (categorized into: no hospitalization, 1–7, 8–21, and >21 days).

Statistical analysis
We plotted the unadjusted proportions of medication use for the overall population as well as by copayment status along with the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We then used univariate and multivariate logistic regression to estimate the crude and multivariate adjusted odds of receiving a given study medication. Since none of our outcomes were rare, we were able to create full multivariate models that included all variables regardless of their statistical significance. In large datasets where outcomes are not rare, full multivariate models are superior to parsimonious models, because they provide better control for residual confounding compared to more restricted models. Odds ratios (OR) were presented with their 95% CIs. Additionally, we showed the population distribution of the number of different study drug classes received among statin, BB, and ACE inhibitor/ARB (minimum 0; maximum 3). Multivariate ordinal logistic regression and linear regression were used to model the associations between covariates and the number of drugs received. All analyses were conducted in the full final study population as well as after restriction to new users of each study drug, i.e. patients who had not received the respective study drug in the year prior to admission for MI. We used the SAS for Windows (release 9.2) software for all statistical analyses (The SAS Institute, Cary, NC).

). Analyses of independent predictors of number of recommended drugs received using linear or ordinal logistic regression confirmed what could be gleaned from the analyses of each drug class: older age, more hospital days in the previous year, indicator drugs for severe heart failure (digitalis, diuretics, vitamin K-antagonist), and antipsychotic use were all independently associated with fewer recommended medications received (results not shown). Gender, however, was not independently associated with number of medications received.


Discussion
In a large population-based study of patients who experienced an acute MI in Austria, we found that ambulatory use of several recommended medications after discharge was suboptimal. Within 120 days after their MI, only 74% patients received a BB, 67% a statin, and 67% filled a prescription for an ACE inhibitor or ARB. Only 41% of patients received all three interventions, while 25% of patients received only one of these beneficial drugs or even none at all. Underuse of these medications is unfortunate from both a patient’s and a societal perspective: while optimal secondary prevention including these drugs prolongs the expected lifespan of a patient after MI, use of these interventions constitutes an attractive allocation of scarce economic resources. Thus, considerable room for improvement is present in the care of patients after MI in Austria, and interventions ought to be targeted towards increasing the prescribing and use of these medications.

]. We found that those indigent patients who had their copayment waived had at least the same level of medication use compared to relatively more affluent patients who were responsible for the copayment portion of their prescription (€4.35), thus indicating that such a waiver successfully removed the economic barriers to filling these prescriptions. Of note, patients whose copayment was waived were more likely to be women and previous recipients of antipsychotic drugs, but otherwise similar to those who were required to pay a copayment (detailed results not shown).
The number of hospital days in the year prior to MI was a strong negative predictor of medication use for all classes. This might reflect greater comorbidity or frailty in these patients, which both have been associated with lower use of and persistence with preventive medications. Similarly, patients receiving antipsychotic drugs had a lower likelihood to receive the study medications, likely indicating treatment bias regarding the mentally diseased. Beta-blocker use was significantly lower among patients who received any drugs for inhalation that are indicated in asthma or COPD, a plausible pattern, which may reflect presence of a relative contraindication or intolerance by the patient. Indeed, among patients without previous use of such asthma or COPD drugs (N = 3,495), BB use after MI was 75.4% (rather than 74.0% in the overall population), an only slightly higher proportion with respect to the goal of appropriately treating all patients free from contraindications. Statins were less likely to be used in patients who had previously used diuretics, digitalis, or coumadin, possibly indicating congestive heart failure or atrial fibrillation and thus, worse prognosis.

]. Cardiogenic shock, hypotension, and certain bradycardic arrhythmias untreated with a pacemaker certainly constitute absolute contraindications, whereas a treatment attempt in patients with stable obstructive lung disease should be conducted. From our dataset, it is difficult to ascertain most of these conditions, but when eliminating all patients who had received inhalative corticosteroids or beta mimetics, the percentage of BB users increased slightly to 75.4% from 74.0% in the overall population.

In summary, we provide evidence for underuse of several recommended medications after MI as recently as 2004 in the Austrian healthcare system. Our observations are in line with findings from other European and North American healthcare systems, despite the differences in data collection and time period studied. Educational efforts need to be directed at both physicians and patients, and the implementation of quality indicators should be considered. Maximizing secondary prevention after MI is highly desirable from an individual patient and the societal perspective.
