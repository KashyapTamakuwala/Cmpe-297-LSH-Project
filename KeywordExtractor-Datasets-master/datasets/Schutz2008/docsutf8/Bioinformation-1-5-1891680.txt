Promoter prediction has gained increased attention in studies related to transcriptional regulation of gene expression.We developed a 
				web server named PMSearch (Poly Matrix Search) which utilizes Position Frequency Matrices (PFMs) to predict transcription factor binding 
				sites (TFBSs) in DNA sequences. PMSearch takes PFMs (either user-defined or retrieved from local dataset which currently contains 507 PFMs 
				from Transfac Public 7.0 and JASPAR) and DNA sequences of interest as the input, then scans the DNA sequences with PFMs and reports the sites 
				of high scores as the putative binding sites. The output of the server includes 1) A plot for the distribution of predicted TFBS along the DNA 
				sequence, 2) A table listing location, score and motif for each putative binding site, and 3) Clusters of predicted binding sites. PMSearch also 
				provides links for accessing clusters of PFMs that are similar to the input PFMs to facilitate complicated promoter analysis.

], have been built to utilize 
			PFMs to predict transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) embedded in promoter sequences. Many of the servers are comprehensive but lack the information on transcription 
			factors whose binding specificities are similar to the input PFMs, which could effectively assist regulatory module finding. To provide such information and to meet the 
			needs for efficient prediction tasks in the study of gene regulation network, we developed a server named PMSearch (Poly Matrix Search) for predicting TFBSs in DNA sequences 
			with the novel functions of fetching similar PFMs and processing multi-forms of input motifs. PMSearch made the following improvements: 1) It has a more succinct and friendly 
			user-interface. 2) It provides user with the convenience of customizing any set of PFMs from the local dataset. 3) It generates a resizable plot that shows the distribution 
			and scores of predicted binding sites in variable scales. 4) It provides clusters of PFMs similar to the input PFMs.

). The user may specify a sub-region on the sequence that will be plotted for more detailed view, such as a specific promoter region in a sequence file. 
			Other results including scores, sequence motifs and closely located putative binding sites (clusters) are also listed. In addition, the server provides a hyperlink for the user to 
			fetch PFMs that are related to the input PFMs by implementing a gap-allowed alignment algorithm. A comprehensive instruction for users is available online.

Conclusion
PMSearch is an easy-to-use and efficient tool that utilizes PFMs to predict transcription factor binding sites in DNA sequences. It offers user the flexibility to search for
putative TFBS with any set of PFMs. PMSearch outputs a plot demonstrating distribution of predicted binding sites and a table of the locations, scores, motifs and clusters of predicted binding 
sites. In addition, PMSearch provides the user access to PFMs that are relative to an input PFM for more sophisticated promoter analysis, as the predicted binding sites of one transcription 
factor could also be bond with other transcription factors that share the similar binding specificity. Such information may give hints to untangle the composite transcription regulatory network. 
We propose to update PFMs in our local dataset regularly. The source codes are available from the authors upon request. 

Caveats

] This could result from 1) The 
			predicted site is located in a context which is insufficient to facilitate transcription factor binding, 2) The low specificity of the input PFM gives rise to large portion of false 
			positive predictions. We suggest the users prepare a list of certain transcription factors that are suspected to regulate the target gene to specify a prediction task.

The scoring scheme is illustrated. 1B: An example of binding site search with PFMs for NF-Kappa B, AP-1 and Sp1 on the sequence of adenovirus early E3 gene (NCBI nucleotide accession: 
      X03002). Orange rectangles represent clusters of putative binding sites. Dark grey bar indicates coding sequence (CDS). The first cluster located on the 5' end contains verified binding 
      sites. This cluster belongs to E3 promoter, which overlaps with the adjacent CDS. High scoring sites located in non-coding sequences or promoters are considered significant
