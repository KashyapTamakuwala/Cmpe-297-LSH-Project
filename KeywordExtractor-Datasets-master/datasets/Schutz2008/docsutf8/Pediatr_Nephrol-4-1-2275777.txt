Neurogenic bladder sphincter dysfunction (NBSD) can cause severe and irreversible renal damage and bladder-wall destruction years before incontinence becomes an issue. Therefore, the first step in adequate management is to recognize early the bladder at risk for upper- and lower-tract deterioration and to start adequate medical treatment proactively. Clean intermittent catheterization combined with anticholinergics (oral or intravesical) is the standard therapy for NBSD. Early institution of such treatment can prevent both renal damage and secondary bladder-wall changes, thereby potentially improving long-term outcomes. In children with severe side effects or with insufficient suppression of detrusor overactivity despite maximal dosage of oral oxybutynin, intravesical instillation is an effective alternative. Intravesical instillation eliminates systemic side effects by reducing the first-pass metabolism and, compared with oral oxybutynin, intravesical oxybutynin is a more potent and long-acting detrusor suppressor. There is growing evidence that with early adequate treatment, kidneys are saved and normal bladder growth can be achieved in children so they will no longer need surgical bladder augmentation to achieve safe urinary continence in adolescence and adulthood.

Introduction
Neurogenic bladder sphincter dysfunction (NBSD) can develop as a result of a lesion at any level in the nervous system, including the cerebral cortex, spinal cord, or peripheral nervous system. Neurologic conditions in children leading to neurogenic bladder dysfunction are predominantly congenital neural tube defects (including myelomeningocele, lipomeningocele, sacral agenesis, and occult lesions causing tethered cord). Acquired causes such as spinal cord tumors or trauma or sequelae of transverse myelitis are less frequent. Whereas from an etiologic standpoint neurogenic bladder dysfunction is a heterogeneous group, medical management will be similar irrespective of the underlying cause. The vast majority of knowledge about NBSD management comes from long-term experience with myelomeningocele (MMC), the most common neural tube defect.
Following the institution of a general treatment policy with advances in neurosurgical and orthopedic treatments in previous decades, governing the associated NBSD has become crucial for improving quality of life and life expectancy in children with neural tube defects. In MMC patients, disordered innervation of the detrusor musculature and external sphincter adversely affects bladder function, which if untreated not only leads to incontinence but also will cause secondary damage and dysfunction of both the upper and lower urinary tracts. Key elements in optimal NBSD management are early diagnosis (including NBSD typology) and early (presymptomatic) institution of adequate medical treatment. There is indeed growing evidence that management decisions made during infancy, which prevent both renal damage and secondary bladder-wall changes, potentially impact long-term outcomes for renal function and safe urinary continence.
After describing the pathophysiology of NBSD and its possible consequences, this paper focuses on diagnosis (including early identification of patients at risk), treatment goals, treatment tools, and practical management of NBSD.

]. Bladder outlet obstruction will lead to elevated (pathologic) voiding pressures, which will contribute to either detrusor decompensation or hypertrophy. Finally, recurrent urinary tract infections due to bladder residue may aggravate damage to the neurogenic bladder through processes of transmural inflammation and fibrosis. Together with high intravesical pressures and/or vesicoureteral reflux, these lower urinary tract infections will lead to episodes of acute pyelonephritis and irreversible renal damage.

Management of the neurogenic bladder
General principles and treatment goals

]. CIC enables complete bladder emptying and thus avoids bladder residues and consequent risks for infections. In the high-risk bladder with DSD, CIC also allows bladder emptying before the occurrence of otherwise “spontaneous” high-pressure voiding, which is known to be detrimental for kidney function and drainage. Oxybutynin, a bladder smooth-muscle relaxant, is used to improve bladder dynamics through suppression of detrusor hypertonicity and hyperreflexia. By doing so, oxybutynin eliminates (high-pressure) uninhibited detrusor contractions (and thus urinary leakage) and prevents high-pressure bladder storage (due to detrusor hypertonicity or low bladder compliance) and high-pressure emptying (in case of DSD).

Early management, including diagnosis and identification of the high-risk bladder

]. The specific abnormalities vary considerably and are not predicted by the level of the spinal cord defect. Furthermore, the dysfunctional pattern may be dynamic, influenced by spinal cord surgery, tethering, and denervation. In the initial baseline evaluation, clinical observations must be completed with urinalysis (microscopy and culture), renal/bladder ultrasound, and cystourethrogram. These allow the experienced clinician to suspect the type of NBSD and to identify the high-risk subgroup. The next consideration is when to perform urodynamic studies.

]. Those authors recommend careful history, physical examination, upper urinary tract imaging, and close follow-up during infancy and childhood, reserving urodynamic studies only for patients with evidence of urinary retention on physical examination, new-onset hydronephrosis or febrile urinary tract infection, or for evaluation to achieve continence. Proponents of this approach with selective urodynamics suggest that close monitoring with prompt intervention at first signs of deterioration is effective in protecting the upper urinary tracts (including preservation of nephrons and thus renal function in the long run). A remaining concern, however, could be that in this more expectant approach, high intravesical pressures may have already resulted in irreversible and avoidable damage to the bladder wall, resulting in small-capacity, low-compliance bladders later in life.
Although many questions regarding optimal evaluation and management remain unanswered, the consensus on the need of close surveillance, especially in the first years of life, plus the possibility that proactive treatment may be better for the bladder in the very long term, emphasize the need for an integrated approach in which clinical observations, serial imaging, and urodynamics are the basis for early adequate treatment.

Once appropriate therapy has been initiated, adequate follow-up is required, with adjustments if needed (CIC frequency, medication dosing and administration route). Treatment efficacy can be assessed using clinical parameters (including CIC frequency and volume charts), urinalysis, renal and bladder ultrasound, X-ray cystography, and video urodynamics.

Conclusions
Medical management with CIC and anticholinergics is effective in preserving renal function and providing safe urinary continence in more than 90% of patients with a neurogenic bladder. Early diagnosis and treatment institution, long before continence becomes an issue at toddler age, can prevent both renal damage and secondary bladder-wall changes, thereby improving long-term outcomes. Compared with oral oxybutynin, intravesical oxybutynin has more potent and longer-acting detrusor suppressive effects with good tolerance and should be used prior to considering surgical therapies. Therapeutic goals should no longer be restricted to prevention of secondary damage to both upper and lower urinary tracts. Instead, our goal should be to achieve normal renal and bladder growth at safe bladder pressure, with appliance-free continence.
