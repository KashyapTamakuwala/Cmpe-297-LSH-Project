Simple sequence repeats (SSRs) have become important molecular markers for a broad range of applications, such as genome 
          mapping and characterization, phenotype mapping, marker assisted selection of crop plants and a range of molecular ecology 
          and diversity studies. These repeated DNA sequences are found in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. They are distributed almost 
          at random throughout the genome, ranging from mononucleotide to trinucleotide repeats. They are also found at longer lengths 
          (> 6 repeating units) of tracts. Most of the computer programs that find SSRs do not report its exact position. A computer 
          program SSRscanner was written to find out distribution, frequency and exact location of each SSR in the genome. SSRscanner 
          is user friendly. It can search repeats of any length and produce outputs with their exact position on chromosome and their 
          frequency of occurrence in the sequence.  
Availability
This program has been written in PERL and is freely available for non-commercial users by request from the authors.

], uses a keyword tree adapted from bibliographic searching techniques and attempts to 
      match the keywords exactly but it does not specify the positions of repeats. In this work, we describe a program called SSRscanner 
      (Simple sequence repeat scanner) that uses dictionary approach to find simple sequence repeats of pre-selected motifs.

] The advantages 
      over many other programs developed for SSR identification includes its ability to search motifs of any length repeated for a 
      number of times and to give the exact position of the motif in the genome.

). They are (1) Motifposition.txt 
				(gives the frequency of each repeat provided 
      in the motif file) and (2) Motifresult.exe (gives the specific location of each repeat). The data obtained can then be arranged 
      into desired formats.


Caveats and Future Development
SSRscanner is a PERL script and it requires PERL to be installed on a PC before running the program. We are developing a web 
      based CGI for SSRscanner.
