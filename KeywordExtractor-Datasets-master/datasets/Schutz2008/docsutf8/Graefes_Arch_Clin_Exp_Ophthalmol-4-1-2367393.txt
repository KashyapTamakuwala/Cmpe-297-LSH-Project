Background
Current after-cataract prevention relies on optimizing the natural barrier effect of the optic rim against lens epithelial cell (LEC) migration. However, deficiencies in circumferential capsular bag closure caused by the intraocular lens (IOL) haptic or delayed secondary re-division of the fused capsules by Soemmering´s ring formation lead to primary or secondary barrier failure. Consequently, surprisingly high posterior laser capsulotomy rates have been reported long-term, even with optimal capsular surgery and the most widespread hydrophobic acrylic IOLs, considered to be the most advanced. Intraoperative removal of the central posterior capsule has been shown to be effective in further reducing LEC immigration. However, efficacy has turned out to be limited because of the propensity of LECs to use the posterior optic surface as an alternative scaffold.

Material and methods
Technique: in pediatric cataract surgery, buttoning-in of the optic into an adequately-centered posterior capsulorhexis opening has been described previously. This technique was further elaborated and applied as the standard technique in a large series of adult eyes. In general, the diameter aimed at was 5–6 mm for the anterior, and 4–5 mm for the posterior capsulorhexis. Between September 2004 and June 2007, 1000 consecutive cases have thus been performed and systematically evaluated. One hundred and fifty eyes additionally underwent extensive anterior LEC abrasion. Another sub-series investigated the option of further reducing capsular fibrosis by creating an anterior capsulorhexis larger than the optic.

Evaluation: special scrutiny was applied to detect postoperative vitreous entrapment. Regeneratory and fibrotic after-cataract formation were both meticulously followed-up. Postoperative pressure course, anterior segment inflammation, macular thickness and morphology, as well as axial optic stability and optic centration, were evaluated in intraindividual comparison studies.




Results
A low rate of vitreous complications was found, which can be avoided by appropriate surgery. Vitreous entanglement occurred in six eyes, and vitreous herniation after PPCCC over-sizing in two. In three, anterior vitrectomy was performed. There was only one single case of retinal detachment—supposedly unrelated to the technique itself—and no case of cystoid macular edema. Retro-optical regenerate formation was completely abolished, while fibrosis was drastically reduced by the posterior capsule sandwiched in between the anterior LEC layer on the backside of the anterior capsule and the anterior optic surface, thereby blocking contact-mediated myofibroblastic LEC transdifferentiation. Additional capsular polishing further reduced residual fibrosis emerging from the anterior capsule contacting the optic adjacent to the haptic junction, as well as regeneratory LEC re-proliferation on the posterior capsule overlying the optic. Postoperative pressure course was almost identical to that found after standard in-the-bag implantation of the IOL, as was flare, and macular thickness and morphology. As opposed to bag-fixated IOLs, no axial movement of the optic was detected. IOL optics always perfectly centered even when the capsular opening was not optimally centered. Due to the exquisite stretchability and elasticity of the posterior capsule, the 6-mm IOL optic could safely be buttoned-in in a posterior capsulorhexis of 4 mm and smaller.

Conclusions
Posterior optic buttonholing (POBH) is a safe and effective technique which not only excludes retro-optical opacification, but also withholds capsular fibrosis by obviating direct contact between the anterior capsular leaf and the optic surface. Anterior LEC abrasion significantly reduced both the residual fibrosis and regeneratory LEC proliferation. Apart from pediatric cataract, POBH is currently recommended for eyes with pseudoexfoliation syndrome, high axial myopia, peripheral retinal disease, and multifocal IOL implantation. Toric IOLs and magnet-driven accommodative IOL systems are other potential applications. Generally, POBH holds promise for becoming a routine alternative to standard in-the-bag IOL implantation in the future.

]. Implementation of all three above-mentioned parameters into modern cataract surgery has led to a drastical reduction of after-cataract and YAG-LCT rates.
However, utilization of the edge barrier effect has two major shortcomings: (1) overlap of the optic by the anterior capsule leaf induces fibrotic whitening and shrinkage of the latter, thereby reducing the size of the free optic zone (this is especially true if the rhexis opening is small or decentered, be it because of inadequate dimensioning or due to subsequent contraction), and (2) the barrier function can be lacking from the very beginning, or wear off over the years, even when all the three above-mentioned requirements are fully met.
24
]. As a result, a gateway is opened up for LECs migrating from the germinative equatorial zone inwards. Deficiencies of capsular bag fusion may also arise independent of the haptic junction. When the reason is not evident, these have been termed “idiopathic primary barrier failure”. Most often, however, it is caused by ovalization of the capsular bag by overly long and rigid haptics, which impedes capsular fusion along the longitudinal IOL axis.

] and 27% [own data in publication]. After 10 years, a cumulative YAG-LCT rate of 42% was found (L. Vock, R. Menapace R. Long-term YAG laser capsulotomy and after-cataract rates with the sharp edge Acrysof and round edge PhacoFlex intraocular lenses: 10 year results. Abstract XXVth Congress of the ESCRS, 8.−12.9.2007, Stockholm). Thereby it must be kept in mind that the YAG-LCT rate only reflects those cases where central pearl formation is significant enough to interfere with vision. When also considering those eyes where LEC invasion remains limited to the periphery of the retrooptical capsule, the rate of barrier failure is significantly higher.
Therefore, the potential for avoiding after-cataract formation by optimizing the edge barrier effect is limited, even when all relevant parameters are fully exploited. In addition, even in those cases where the sharp edge forms a permanent circumferential barrier, visibility of the peripheral retina may be significantly reduced by pearl formation in the intercapsular space outside of the optic rim.

].

Rationale
The still significant percentage of after-cataract formation requiring YAG-LCT in the longer run, and the problem of dysphotopsia, have fostered the search for better alternatives. Thereby, a new approach was required, since the concept of optimizing the migrational barrier effect of the optic edge is largely exploited.
As one option, intraoperative removal of the central posterior capsule by performing a primary posterior continuous curvilinear capsulorhexis (PPCCC) seemed promising, since the posterior capsule serves as a scaffold for centrally migrating LECs. As such, it is not an alternative, but much more supplements the current sharp edge concept by providing a “second barrier of defence” when the optic edge barrier is overcome by migrating LECs.

Fig. 1
Primary posterior capsulorhexis decreases YAG laser capsulotomy rate by removing scaffold for LEC migration; however, residual capsule may still opacify, and LECs may alternatively grow upon optic surface




Thus, a PPCCC constitutes a useful additive surgical measure, but does not fully prevent after-cataract formation.
6
]. By doing so, the posterior capsule ends up lying on top of the optic. Instead of hindering the LECs from migrating, these are diverted towards the anterior optic surface, thus bypassing the optic edge. By doing so, migrating LECs, by principle, can no longer access the retrolental space.
In order to elucidate the suitability of the posterior optic buttonholing (POBH) technique as a routine procedure for senile cataracts, an extensive prospective study comprising a large number of eyes was initiated. In several substudies, a prospective randomized bilateral design was used to elucidate the risk profile compared to the standard in-the-bag implantation of IOLs in detail.
For this purpose, the surgical technique of POBH was revised and optimized to be then systematically investigated. From September 2004 to June 2007, over 1000 eyes underwent this POBH procedure. Patients were randomly taken from the waiting list. All prospective comparison studies were approved by the Medical University of Vienna Ethics Committee.

Discussion
The advantages, possible downsides, and specific features of the technique are addressed in the following:

). By principle, migrating LECs can no longer access the retrolental space. At the optic junctions where the posterior capsule leaf undercrosses the haptic base, the high pressure exerted by the distended posterior capsule ring blocks LEC migration beneath the junctions.

10

]. Buttoning-in causes the posterior capsule to be sandwiched between the anterior capsule and the optic, avoiding direct contact between the two. Consequently, LEC transdifferentiation of the anterior LEC layer is not initiated (“no contact - no fibrosis”). Only along the capsulorhexis edges some residual fibrosis may be seen. The usually seen extensive fibrosis of the whole anterior LEC layer remains restricted to the area of direct optic contact inside the optic junction.

1
]. Usually transient, it may also be permanent. Though mostly limited to the periphery, it may in cases cover the whole free optic zone. With POBH this complication is abolished, since the crescent-shaped projection of posterior capsule forms a buffer zone between the anterior rhexis edge and the free optic. As with fibrosis, the optic ongrowth is restricted to the areas of direct anterior capsule contact to optic inside the haptic-optic junction.

Eradication of residual fibrosis and ongrowth with additional polishing. Additional polishing of the anterior capsule specifically avoids fibrosis or ongrowth inside the haptic-optic junction, and fully excludes residual fibrosis in the areas where both capsules overlap.

10
11
]. Since with POBH the migrating LECs are redirected to the anterior optic surface instead of being halted at the optic rim, the after-cataract preventive effect is completely independent of fibrosis. Polishing, therefore, does not promote retrolental LEC ingrowth when combined with POBH.

11
), since the centering force is exerted by the loops which reside in the capsular bag fornix. As opposed to standard capsular bag fixation, centration of the optic is also independent of the size and centration of the ACCC.

12
). If the PPCC opening should happen to be too small to allow for buttonholing, the PPCCC can be either secondarily enlarged (similar to an ACCC), or the optic is simply placed in the bag without being buttoned in. In fact, this only happened in the early series in cases with a poorly dilating pupil.

Immediate stability of capsular diaphragm and implant. Due to the lack of forward movement of the optic as seen after in-the bag fixation due to the loss of haptic memory and the distension of the capsule diaphragm as the capsules seal and fibrose, no myopic refractive shift occurs. While delayed by up to 4 weeks after bag-fixation depending upon the haptic design and material, final refraction is thus instantly attained, allowing prescription of final glasses 1 week after surgery, when the patient is seen by the referring ophthalmologist.

Posterior positioning of the IOL optic by about 1 mm compared to bag-fixation significantly increases the interspace between the iris and optic. This avoids chronic iris chafing when a sulcus-fixated add-on IOL is secondarily implanted in order to correct for an erroneous IOL power selection, or to add astigmatic correction or multifocality.

. Also, efforts in improving IOL materials may solely concentrate on optical performance, biostability and biocompatibility irrespective of their LEC inhibiting properties.



As opposed to PPCCC with bag-fixation of the optic, POBH creates a stable and watertight diaphragm. Vitreous prolapse or entanglement will not occur should the anterior chamber flatten after retracting the aspiration–infusion tip following removal of residual OVD from the anterior chamber.
The POBH technique as such is safe and highly effective with regard to after-cataract prevention. It is not only feasible, but highly recommended to perform it under topical anesthesia in order to guarantee bright and stable retroillumination when performing the PPCCC. No special or extra instruments or implants are required.
Interestingly, no case of endophthalmitis occurred in the whole series, despite the fact that no intracameral or postoperative antibiotic prophylaxis had been performed. Though this series is not large enough to draw a meaningful conclusion, it may be attributed to the fact that buttonholing avoids seclusion of bacteria within the retrolental space. Other than with bag-fixation, the optic and capsule surface are fully exposed to the aqueous humor circulation from both sides. In case of an endophthalmitis, the vitreous cavity may be easily accessed for translimbal tapping and bimanual vitrectomy after temporary desenclavation of the IOL optic.
Sizing of the ACCC
13
right
). However, combining a standard 5 mm ACCC with anterior capsule polishing is definitely recommended over creating an overly large ACCC,because of the following downsides of the latter. Appropriate dimensioning of the PPCCC is rendered more difficult since the ACCC can no longer be utilized as a ruler, making unintentional under- or oversizing more likely. Should a PPCCC result to be much larger than the optic, alternative buttoning-in of the IOL optic through the ACCC opening can then no longer be resorted to. Also, a posterior capsule that only slightly overlaps the optic may be pulled off its edge as fibrosis of the anterior capsule sets in. Delayed gaping of the capsule-IOL diaphragm along the optic rim, with possible consecutive vitreous herniation, may result, as has happened in two cases. Therefore, a 5-mm ACCC combined with anterior capsule polishing is definitely preferable over creating an oversized ACCC.

Viscodissection of the central hyaloid-capsular interspace (Berger´s space and Wieger´s ligament)
.
14
). In practice, a great anatomical variability is experienced while performing a PPCCC in adult or senile eyes. In some eyes, attachment along Wieger´s ligament is no longer present, with the two united compartments thus forming one commun patent interspace. In others, there is hardly any interspace present, and viscoseparation of the strongly adhering membranes may be difficult to perform. This may be very difficult or not at all anticipated using the slitlamp with a cataractous lens. Therefore, utmost care must be used when centrally incising the posterior capsule, and inadvertent puncturing of the anterior hyaloid membrane still cannot be fully excluded. If in such a case larger quantities of OVD were injected through the capsular opening immediately after puncturing, the OVD might find its way through the punctured hyaloid surface and spread behind it within the vitreous body. This is excluded by performing part of the PPCCC beforehand. Only then, OVD is injected into Berger´s space to ensure that separation of the anterior hyaloid surface from the capsule has been attained. Viscodissection is then continued until Wieger´s ligament, if still adherent to the capsule, is severed and Girard´s space peripheral to it is accessed.

Sizing and centration of the PPCCC
.
The posterior capsule being extremely stretchable and elastic, buttoning-in will also be feasible when a PPCCC turns out to be smaller than 4 mm. Also, the forces of the haptics will center the optic unto the anatomical axis within a suboptimally centered PPCCC. Therefore, though a 5 mm diameter and perfect centration should always be aimed at, deviation from this target will be tolerated. However, with a too large PPCCC that evades the optic rim, even when only along part of optic circumference, the IOL must be buttonholed through the ACCC with the loops either placed in the sulcus or capsular bag equator in order to avoid delayed vitreous prolapse. Therefore, the ACCC should be well-centered and no larger than 5–6 mm in diameter, to preserve the option of anterior rhexis fixation of the optic. Apart from providing an alternative for safe IOL fixation, an appropriately dimensioned ACCC also serves as a ruler for adequate sizing of the PPCCC.

], which could potentially lead to extension of the PPCCC or protrusion of the vitreous surface.

Viscodissection of the peripheral hyaloid-capsular interspace (Girard´s space)
.
Before implanting the IOL, the peripheral interspace between posterior capsule and anterior hyaloid must be circumferentially dissected with OVD in preparation of optic buttonholing. If not appropriately performed, the hyaloid surface may be shoveled up and damaged by the rim of the optic.

]. In our series of over 1000 POBH cases performed so far, not a single case of clinically significant CME was reported, and our OCT study revealed no difference in macular thickness or morphology.



CME is provoked by the dissipation of cytokines released in the anterior segment, and by vitreous traction exerted by the anterior displacement of the vitreous body following exchange of the natural lens volume by a thin artificial lens. In these regards, POBH has certain advantages over standard in-the-bag IOL implantation. Firstly, as opposed to a sole PPCCC, optic buttoning-in creates a watertight diaphragm blocking the posterior dissipation of cytokines. In addition, viscodissection of the posterior capsule and anterior hyaloid creates a contiguous cushion of OVD behind the capsule–IOL diaphragm including the zonular region which precludes access of cytokines to the posterior segment until it is eventually resorbed. The more posterior positioning of the buttonholed optic together with the OVD cushion behind it, and the lack of subsequent anterior movement of the optic, prevent both immediate and delayed anterior displacement of the vitreous body. Severing the attachments between the posterior capsule and the hyaloid, namely Wieger´s ligament, may help to avoid traction on the vitreous when the chamber happens to flatten during OVD aspiration, or thereafter.

bottom
), it inherently stabilizes the vitreous, and thus may avoid or delay posterior vitreous detachment. Severing of all adhesions between the posterior capsule and the anterior hyaloid and creating a cushion of OVD behind the capsule-IOL diaphragm, which is only slowly resorbed, may serve as an additional protective factor. A longterm study, including the incidence of vitreous and retinal detachment following POBH, is required to establish possible advantages of this technique over standard in-the-bag implantation of IOLs.

In conclusion, primary posterior capsulorhexis combined with posterior optic buttonholing is a well-controlled, safe, and highly effective procedure with a steep learning curve, thus carrying the potential of becoming a routine alternative to standard in-the-bag implantation of intraocular lenses. As opposed to standard in-the-bag placement, its effectiveness is completely independent of optic material and optic edge design. This technique is meant for the skilled and dedicated surgeon, and must be carefully approached. It should be reserved to large pupil eyes. Should the pupil come down during the surgery, one may switch to standard in-the-bag surgery, optionally combined with a small PPCCC. Thorough viscodissection of anterior hyaloid and posterior capsule is crucial. Additional anterior capsule polishing is highly recommended, as it abolishes any residual fibrosis without any risks or downsides. Though long-term results in children's eyes support sustained efficacy and lack of complications, 5-year results should be awaited until the technique may be considered or recommended as a routine alternative to standard in-the-bag fixation of the IOL. For the time being, it is recommended with pseudoexfoliation syndrome, high axial myopia, peripheral retinal disease, multifocal IOLs, and toric IOLs when made available.
