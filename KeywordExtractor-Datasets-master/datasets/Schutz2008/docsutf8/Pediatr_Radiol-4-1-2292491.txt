β-Thalassaemia major is a hereditary haemolytic anaemia that is treated with multiple blood transfusions. A major complication of this treatment is iron overload, which leads to cell death and organ dysfunction. Chelation therapy, used for iron elimination, requires effective monitoring of the body burden of iron, for which serum ferritin levels and liver iron content measured in liver biopsies are used as markers, but are not reliable. MRI based on iron-induced T2 relaxation enhancement can be used for the evaluation of tissue siderosis. Various MR protocols using signal intensity ratio and mainstream relaxometry methods have been used, sometimes with discrepant results. Relaxometry methods using multiple echoes achieve better sampling of the time domain in which relaxation mechanisms take place and lead to more precise results. In several studies the MRI parameters of liver siderosis have failed to correlate with those of other affected organs, underlining the necessity for MRI iron evaluation in individual organs. Most studies have included children in the evaluated population, but MRI data on very young children are lacking. Wider application of relaxometry methods is indicated, with the establishment of universally accepted MRI protocols, and further studies, including young children, are needed.

Conclusion
It is evident that MR relaxometry has the potential to become the method of choice for non-invasive, safe and accurate assessment of iron load. Further theoretical research, along with studies monitoring wider age groups of patients are needed before a generally accepted protocol can be established. Until then, extreme caution is needed in its clinical application and interpretation. Experimental artefacts, non-optimized protocols, poor data analysis and unawareness of the inherent limitations of current methodologies in assessing a heavy body iron burden can result in misleading diagnosis and inappropriate management of thalassaemia patients with iron overload. Future experimental developments in relaxometry based on a better theoretical understanding of the contribution of the iron-containing proteins to the MR signal are expected to further strengthen its clinical role in the monitoring of patients with β-thalassaemia major.
