Abstract
A number of β-sandwich immunoglobulin-like domains have been shown
                    to fold using a set of structurally equivalent residues that form a folding
                    nucleus deep within the core of the protein. Formation of this nucleus is
                    sufficient to establish the complex Greek key topology of the native state.
                    These nucleating residues are highly conserved within the immunoglobulin
                    superfamily, but are less well conserved in the fibronectin type III (fnIII)
                    superfamily, where the requirement is simply to have four interacting
                    hydrophobic residues. However, there are rare examples where this nucleation
                    pattern is absent. In this study, we have investigated the folding of a novel
                    member of the fnIII superfamily whose nucleus appears to lack one of the four
                    buried hydrophobic residues. We show that the folding mechanism is unaltered,
                    but the folding nucleus has moved within the hydrophobic core.

 The critical nucleus surrounds this obligatory nucleus, but the
                    degree of structure formation varies between different proteins.
The residues that form the obligatory folding nucleus are highly conserved
                    within immunoglobulin domains but are conserved only in terms of residue type in
                    fibronectin type III (fnIII) domains. However, there are rare examples of
                    proteins that appear to have a disparate nucleation pattern. Here, we have
                    identified a fnIII domain in which one of the hydrophobic residues in the
                    conserved folding nucleus has been replaced by a surface polar residue, and we
                    ask how the folding mechanism has been affected. An extensive protein
                    engineering Φ-value analysis reveals that the folding mechanism is unaltered,
                    but that a spatially different set of core residues is used to form the
                    obligatory folding nucleus, where interactions within each sheet establish the
                    correct hydrogen bond registry between the core β-strands. Subsequent
                    interactions between two such pairs are able to bring the β-sheets together and
                    set up the complex Greek key topology.

 Small hydrophilic residues, such as asparagine or aspartate,
                        are found very rarely (only in ∼ 3% of all cases).

 Interestingly, about 15% of the fnIII domains appear to
                        fold without any aromatic residues at the supposed folding positions,
                        suggesting that a large side-chain is not crucial for the formation of the
                        obligatory nucleus.

                        However, again like other Ig-like proteins, there is a significant number of
                        residues, in the peripheral A and G-strands, and in loops that have Φ-values
                        close to 0, suggesting that in the final stage of folding these peripheral
                        strands and loops pack onto the central region of the protein.

Identification of the obligate (embryonic) folding nucleus

 In summary, it is not possible simply to “pick” residues
                        with the highest Φ-values as being those that form the folding nucleus: one
                        also has to consider the packing of the residues. In TNfn3, as is observed
                        here for CAfn2, residues in the B-strand have generally low Φ-values
                        compared to the Φ-values in the other central β-strands. This does not
                        necessarily mean that the residues in the B-strand are less important for
                        folding. Residue L22(B3) in CAfn2, for example, forms about half of its
                        inter-strand contacts with residues in the A and G-strands, which have
                        Φ-values of ∼ 0. Thus, the contacts with the C (V38), E
                        (A53 and I55) and F (F66 and V68) strands must be more formed than the
                        moderate Φ-value would indicate. Similarly, the high Φ-values in the
                        C′-strand probably reflect the fact that the residues in this strand make
                        the vast majority of their tertiary contacts with residues in the C and
                        E-strands, which are themselves partially formed. In TNfn3 it was suggested
                        that this C′-strand is “obliged” to fold when the adjoining C and E-strands
                        pack together. Thus, we would now, following the nomenclature suggested by
                        the Oliveberg model, assign residues in the C′-strand to the critical
                        contact layer and not to the obligatory embryonic nucleus.

Figure 6
). We
                        suggest that the residues surrounding the obligate nucleus, residues in the
                        C′-strand and more peripheral residues in the B, C E and F-strands, pack
                        onto these obligate nucleus residues and, together, form the critical
                        contact layer required to stabilise the transition state structure
                        sufficiently to drive folding.
There is a caveat we should make. We note that in CAfn2 it is more
                        difficult to select which residues are likely to form part of the obligate
                        nucleus than it was in TNfn3. Consider the B-strand. I20(B2) exhibits a
                        Φ-value that is slightly lower, but is within error of L22(B3). However, I20
                        forms no contacts with the nucleating residues from the opposite sheet,
                        (V38(C4) and V68(E4)), suggesting that it does not form part of the
                        obligatory nucleus that establishes the topology of the molecule.
                        Furthermore, as was the case in TNfn3, we were unable to determine a Φ-value
                        for the highly conserved Trp in the position B4. Simulations confirmed for
                        TNfn3 that this Trp residue had a low Φ-value (as we had inferred from the
                        pattern of Φ-values surrounding the Trp residue). Trp 24 makes 150
                        side-chain–side-chain contacts in CAfn2, and 65% of these contacts are with
                        residues that have Φ-values that are (or are predicted to be) low (Φ ∼ 0.15, 52 contacts) or zero (46 contacts).
                        Less than one-third of the contacts made by Trp24 are with residues in the
                        putative obligatory nucleus (with L22, V38 and V68) and no contact is made
                        with I55. Thus, we tentatively propose that if Trp24 does have a role in the
                        folding nucleus, it is more likely to be in the critical layer than in the
                        topology-defining obligate nucleus. Also consider residue A70 in the
                        F-strand in position F5. The Φ-value for this residue is very slightly
                        higher than that for V68 in layer F4. However, Ala to Gly mutation must be
                        considered to be non-conservative and, furthermore, Ala70 makes no contact
                        within the proposed obligate nucleus i.e. it cannot have a role in
                        establishing the Greek key topology.

). Perhaps unexpectedly, a
                        corresponding “downwards migration” has not occurred in the B–E-sheet; (even
                        if Trp24 was important, the Φ-value for A53(E4) is unambiguously low
                        (0.14)). Such migration is not necessary; analysis of the CAfn2 structure
                        shows clearly that residues L22(B3) and I55(E3) form significant
                        interactions with V68(F4) and V38(C4) in the opposite sheet. Thus, these
                        inter-sheet interactions would be sufficient to establish the Greek key
                        topology.

) and consequently it is less
                        restrained within the transition state (Φ-values for Y64(F2) and L58(E2) are
                        0.04 and 0.16, respectively).

In summary, for both proteins we observe the formation of a specific
                        nucleus in the core of the protein involving formation of long-range
                        tertiary contacts between a single residue from each of the B, C, E and
                        F-strands. Formation of this “obligate” nucleus establishes the topology of
                        the protein. Other residues pack around this obligate nucleus to form the
                        critical contact layer until sufficient contacts have formed to surmount the
                        free-energy barrier. This is typical of a nucleation-condensation folding
                        mechanism. The peripheral strands and the loops pack late, mainly after the
                        rate-limiting step for folding.

Conclusion: plasticity within the obligatory folding nucleus
                        in Ig-like domains
Unlike other classes of proteins, such as the homeodomain proteins, all
                        Ig-like proteins appear to fold by the same, nucleation condensation
                        mechanism. The obligate nucleus is defined by the interactions that are
                        necessary to establish the complex Greek key β-sheet topology of the native
                        state. Previous biophysical studies of members of the Ig-like fold have
                        shown that this folding nucleus always comprises a ring of interacting
                        residues within the hydrophobic core: one residue from each of the B, C, E
                        and F-strands. Whereas the obligatory nucleus in the immunoglobulin
                        superfamily proteins is highly conserved and is based around the invariant
                        tryptophan located within the C-strand, members of the fnIII superfamily
                        show more variability. Instead of restricting a particular structural
                        position to a specific amino acid, each position simply needs to possess a
                        hydrophobic residue. Here, we have shown that the fnIII nucleus is more
                        flexible still, and that when this pattern of residue conservation is lost
                        upon mutation, fnIII proteins can “migrate” the folding nucleus, thereby
                        revealing plasticity in the early stages of the folding process, while
                        retaining the same folding mechanism.

 It is possible that the ability of these Ig-like domains to
                        alter their folding pathway on mutation has contributed to the success of
                        this fold, and has contributed to its abundance in the proteome (over
                        40,000 Ig-like domains are listed in the current Pfam database).

A simplified representation of the CAfn2 (left, green) and TNfn3
                    (right, orange) structures showing the mutated positions within each strand. The
                    core of the proteins is divided into six layers, residues within the same layer
                    pack against each other on opposite β-sheets. The differences in loop lengths
                    between CAfn2 and TNfn3 are shown for each loop in the CAfn2 representation (+
                    means the CAfn2 loop is longer, –– means the CAfn2 loop is shorter). The
                    Φ-values are marked in blue for each position. The obligatory folding positions
                    are shown as a red oval.

                    based on the Φ-values and contact maps between the residues in the hydrophobic

                    The separation of data points into two discrete populations shows that the
                    folding nucleus of both proteins is not a uniformly expanded form of the native
                    state. The central core of the protein forms early and the peripheral regions
                    pack after the transition state for folding.

Comparison of the Φ-value patterns in CAfn2 (red) and TNfn3 (blue).
                    (a) The pattern of Φ-values in the A–B–E strand is the same with the highest
                    Φ-values falling in layer 3. (b) In the C′-C-F-G sheet, however, the residues
                    with the highest Φ-values in CAfn2 are in a lower layer than in
                TNfn3.
