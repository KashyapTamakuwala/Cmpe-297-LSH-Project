 receptors or due to the degradation of extracellular neucleotides by apyrase was not different between non-transfected and botulinum toxin C1 light chain expressing cells. However, the inhibition of cyclic AMP synthesis caused by depolarization-evoked release of endogenous nucleotides was either abolished or greatly reduced in cells expressing the botulinum toxin C1 light chain. Together, these results show that spontaneous nucleotide release from neuroendocrine cells may occur independently of vesicle exocytosis, whereas depolarization-evoked nucleotide release relies predominantly on exocytotic mechanisms.

After a 1 h incubation at 37°C, two additional volumes of serum-free medium and the appropriate amount of serum (as above) were added. This medium was exchanged 48 h after transfection for a medium supplemented with 500 μg/ml neomycin (G418) to allow for selection of drug resistance. This selection medium was replaced every 3–4 days until distinct islands of surviving cells were visible. Individual clones of antibiotic-resistant cells were transferred to 24-well plates and grown in medium containing 200 μg/ml G418.

]. Materials and methodology used for production and analysis of ECL-immunoblots were also essentially as described therein, with the following modifications: protein extracts in SDS sample buffer were incubated at 95°C for 5 min and subjected to sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) on 5% (stacking) and 10% (separating) gels. After electrophoretic transfer of proteins to nitrocellulose, membranes were cut horizontally along appropriate molecular weight markers in order to separate regions harbouring proteins with apparent molecular weights of 10–20 kD, 21–29 kD and 30–50 kD. These membrane strips were incubated in one of the following monoclonal SNARE antibodies: syntaxin 1 antibody clone 78.3, synaptobrevin 2 antibody clone 69.1 (both obtained from Synaptic Systems, Göttingen, Germany) and SNAP-25 antibody MAB331 (purchased from Chemicon, Temecula, CA, USA).

Therefore, basal outflow during periods of stimulation was assumed to equate the arithmetic mean of the samples preceding and those following stimulation, respectively. The difference between the total and the estimated basal outflow was expressed as a percentage of the total radioactivity in the cultures at the beginning of the respective stimulation (% of total activity).

Hence, to be able to directly compare changes in CGS 21680-induced cAMP synthesis in different cell clones, values obtained in the presence of ADP, apyrase, 2MesAMP or KCl were expressed as percentage of the values obtained in the very same preparation, but in the absence of these agents (% of control).

Taken together, the present results show that the expression of the BoNT/C1 light chain impairs vesicular transmitter release from PC12 cells, but does not alter the autocrine/paracrine activation of P2Y receptors by spontaneously released nucleotides. Thus, the spontaneous nucleotide release from neuroendocrine cells may occur independently of vesicle exocytosis. The depolarization-evoked nucleotide release, in contrast, relies predominantly on exocytotic mechanisms.
