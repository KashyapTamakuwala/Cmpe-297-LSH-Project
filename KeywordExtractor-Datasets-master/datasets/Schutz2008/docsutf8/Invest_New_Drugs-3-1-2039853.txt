], we initiated a new randomized clinical trial to investigate whether these effects of ATP could be confirmed in patients with different types of cancer in the pre-terminal stage of disease (life expectancy 1–6 months). In view of the short life expectancy of these patients, and based on the favorable safety profile of ATP, we decided to administer ATP in the home setting.
The aim of the present study was to investigate the safety of ATP administration at home in pre-terminal cancer patients. We hypothesized that side effects of ATP infusions would occur mainly during the first ATP infusion, especially during assessment of the MTD of ATP. We also hypothesized that the presence of cardiac disorders and/or lung cancer would lead to a lower MTD, and a higher frequency of side effects.

, or the MTD, if this was lower, had been reached. Thereafter, ATP was infused at a continuous rate. If any side effects occurred, the dose was reduced until side effects disappeared. Blood pressure and pulse were registered before starting the infusion, at 30 min after determining the MTD, and just before the infusion was stopped.
Since initiation of ATP infusions under medical supervision in a clinical setting would facilitate the treatment of possible side effects, the first two ATP infusions were given at the day care center of the participating hospitals. Based on evaluation of safety data in the first 22 patients, in view of the mild character of the noted side effects during the first two infusions in these patients, the Ethical Committee granted permission to administer only the first ATP infusion at the day care center and all subsequent infusions at home. The description below applies to the procedures in case of only one hospital infusion.
At the end of the first infusion, the safety and tolerated dose of ATP was evaluated for each individual patient. Subsequent infusions were given at the patients’ home by an experienced and trained nurse of a specialized infusion team, usually embedded in the regional Community Care Organization. The MTD as determined during the first infusion at the day care center was also the maximum dose for this patient for the next infusions at home. The same rule was applied for subsequent home infusions, so that the infusion rate in any subsequent ATP infusion course was never higher than the MTD during the previous ATP infusion. Patients and their partners were instructed extensively regarding the infusion procedures; also, they were instructed to immediately call the involved infusion team in case of any side effects.

] on a four-point scale, according to seriousness. In this system, dyspnea is graded as follows: 0, no change; 1, not defined; 2, dyspnea on significant exertion; 3, dyspnea at normal activity; 4, dyspnea at rest. Since most terminal cancer patients are at rest, dyspnea would in these cases automatically be classified as CTC grade 4, which would misrepresent the actual severity of the symptoms and disregard the intention of the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria (i.e. CTC grade 4 = life-threatening). For this reason, we decided to apply the general toxicity grading of the CTC also for dyspnea, i.e. 1, mild; 2, moderate; 3, severe; and 4, life-threatening.

In case of persistent or severe chest pain, suspect for potential cardiac ischemia, an ECG was made in order to exclude this.

Side effects

Fig. 2
Reported side effects of ATP according to location (day care centre vs. home), time of reporting side effects (during vs. after the infusion), and person to whom the side effects were reported (nurse vs. researcher)




At the day care center, 63 side effects were reported in 95 infusions (0.66 side effect per infusion). Of these 63 side effects, 56 (89%) were reported to the nurse, of which 55 during the infusions and 1 afterwards; and 7 (11%) to the researcher when specifically asked for. At home, 129 side effects were reported in 171 infusions (0.75 side effect per infusion); of these, 82 (64%) were reported to the nurse, of which 41 during the infusions and 41 afterwards; and 47 (36%) to the researcher when specifically asked for. All side effects were transient and resolved within minutes after lowering the ATP infusion rate.
In a total of 99 infusions, one or more side effects were reported by patients. In the 51 infusions with one or more side effects reported during ATP administration, the infusion was stopped in 13 infusions (25%), lowered in 30 infusions (59%) and not changed in 8 infusions (16%). Of the latter eight infusions, the side effects had already disappeared before lowering the infusion rate in four infusions, whereas in three infusions the side effects had already been present before the start of the ATP infusions; in one infusion, extravasation occurred, and the ATP infusion was temporarily interrupted. In 48 out of the total of 99 infusions with one or more side effects, the side effects were reported by patients to the nurse or researcher only after completion of the infusion, and the infusion rate was therefore not adapted.

], chest discomfort/pain, dyspnea and the urge to take a deep breath were frequent side effects.
Results showed that in 43 out of 51 infusions (84%) with side effects reported during ATP administration, the infusion rate was lowered or stopped according to protocol. Reasons for not lowering the infusion rate in eight infusions were the fact that in four infusions complaints disappeared automatically; in three infusions the reported complaints were already present before the start of the infusion; and in one infusion extravasation occurred with a temporary interruption of the ATP infusion.
In 48 infusions with side effects, side effects had only been reported after completion of the concerned ATP infusion and the infusion rate was therefore not adapted. One potential explanation for this finding may be that patients were eager to receive ATP at the highest possible dose, as some patients expressed their worry that the potential effectiveness of ATP could fade in case of lowering the dose (similar to chemotherapy), despite our explicit explanation to patients prior to the study that there is currently no evidence that the efficacy of ATP would be better at higher ATP doses. Another possible explanation is that patients in our study population were used to experiencing far more serious complaints caused by progression of the disease and/or previous antitumor treatment.

”), and two CTC 3 side effects (chest discomfort) occurred at the day care center, with no abnormalities on ECG. The other two CTC 3 side effects occurred at home, one with the nurse still being present; and in the other case, the nurse immediately arrived.
Side effects were not limited to the period of MTD assessment, nor were they limited to the first ATP infusion. The implication of this finding is that alertness with regard to potential side effects of ATP administration is necessary during all subsequent ATP infusions, and not just during the first infusion or MTD assessment.
The lower MTD found in the presence of cardiac disorders or lung cancer indicates that patients with these disorders tolerate lower doses of ATP without side effects than patients without these disorders. Moreover, even at the lower MTD, side effects tend to be more frequent in the presence of cardiac disorders. Because all patients with presence of COPD also had cardiac disorders or lung cancer, this subgroup was not analyzed separately.

] showing that side effects that do appear are mild and transient, resolving within minutes after lowering the ATP infusion rate. Nevertheless, it remains possible that some side effects could be prevented by encouraging patients to report any side effects without delay. This emphasizes the need for careful instruction and facilitating patients reporting and monitoring of side effects when ATP infusions are administered at home. As patients with cardiac disorders and lung cancer appear to have a lower MTD and more side effects, these patients should be monitored with special care.
