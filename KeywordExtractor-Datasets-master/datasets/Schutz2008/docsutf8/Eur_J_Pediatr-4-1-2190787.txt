Introduction
Long-term follow-up studies have revealed a high frequency of developmental disturbances in preterm survivors of neonatal intensive care who were formerly considered to be non-disabled. These developmental disturbances interfere with the acquisition of everyday skills and, in particular, with normal school functioning.

Methods
Developmental and school outcomes of 355 children, age 5 years at the time of the study, who had a mean gestational age of 30.2 weeks (SD: 1.95) and a mean birth weight of 1272 g (SD: 326) were investigated. Children with severe handicaps were excluded from the study. Perinatal data, information from a parental and school questionnaire and data from standardized developmental tests were used to explain the differences.

Results
An agreement of 72% was found between developmental follow-up and school outcomes. Normal developmental results but problematic school outcomes were found for 15% of the children tested. There were more boys than girls in this latter group as well as small-for-gestational-age children with relatively poor motor or language development. The schools had not identified problems in 13% of the children, whereas their developmental outcomes were problematic. These children had less neonatal morbidity and relatively higher IQ’s than children who also had problematic developmental outcomes but who had been signalled as problematic by their schools.

Conclusions
Schools have a good insight in the school functioning of children who are developing well and of children with the lowest developmental scores and the most complicated neonatal histories. How school and developmental outcomes interrelate in the in-between groups remains a challenging question that could be answered by following these children throughout their school career.

Mild developmental disturbances usually pose no problem for the child until greater demands have to be met at school or when more detailed evaluations are made. In addition, the cumulative effect of the failure to acquire basic skills and the resulting declining motivation may play an important role. In The Netherlands, schools are focused strongly on the early detection of children who need special assistance. After 1 year of education, at the age of 5, teachers usually have a good impression of both the cognitive and language development of their children and of their motor skills and behaviour. Standardized tests are used to assess children who are not doing well at school, and the data from these tests are used to underpin the need for special help for these children. Additionally, many neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) have follow-up programmes for premature children in which standardized assessments of different domains enable an overall evaluation of the child's development.
35
]. We studied the degree of agreement between follow-up assessments and school outcomes as well as the most important characteristics of the children (perinatal, developmental and socio-economic) in this context. Our aim was to obtain a understanding of the (potential) developmental disturbances in order to facilitate an adequate and timely signalling of children who need special help to meet their developmental capacities.

Methods
Study population
The study population consisted of 768 infants of less than 32 weeks of gestation and/or weighing less than 1500 g who were born between October 1992 and December 1994 and treated in three Dutch neonatal intensive care units: the Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, the Academic Medical Centre, Amsterdam, and the Máxima Medical Centre, Veldhoven. Mortality before the age of 5 years was 131 (17%). Forty-six children (6%) were excluded because they had participated in another study. Thirty-three children (4%) with severe or moderate cerebral palsy, blindness, mental retardation, chromosomal abnormalities, inborn errors of metabolism, personality developmental disorders and/or attendance at special schools or institutions were excluded. Sixty children (8%) of non-Dutch parents were excluded from the analyses since school problems could be caused by language and cultural problems. As a result, 498 children (65%) qualified for the study.

Assessment at the age of 5 years
Clinical assessments were carried out on the health and neurological functioning of the children (not reported in this article) and four developmental domains: cognition, language, motor functioning and behaviour. A paediatrician, a child psychologist and a paediatric physical therapist assessed the children. Appointments were scheduled at random.

This test included logical reasoning, word knowledge, visual-motor integration and word fluency. It also included visual synthesis for children younger than 5.2 years and visual analysis and memory for children aged 5.2 years or older. The norm score (IQ score) of the test is 100 with a standard deviation (SD) of 15. All scores higher or equal to 85 are classified as normal, while scores below 1 or 2 SD’s are classified as mild or severe cognitive problems, respectively.

Statistical analysis
In order to compare the results of the follow-up assessments and school outcomes, we cross-tabulated categorical data originating from the individual developmental test results of the children with school outcomes (normal or problematic). Normal follow-up outcomes were defined as four normal developmental scores or only one mild developmental problem score. Problematic follow-up outcomes were defined as two mild developmental problem scores, one severe developmental problem score or two or more severe developmental problem scores.

]. Further research should reveal if the problems of this latter group of children are attributable to not being ready for learning (pre) academic skills or to still being too playful, or whether it concerns serious learning and developmental problems.
The limited number of children with developmental problems who were not signalled by the school did not have special characteristics with the exception of having slightly better developmental outcomes and/or having not been born extremely premature, having not been subjected to neonatal steroids and/or having had a somewhat less complicated neonatal period. It is possible that their developmental problems did not interfere with school functioning or they were able to compensate for them, but it is also possible that their parents and/or teachers did not signal their problems adequately. Parents are sometimes very relieved that the first difficult and worrisome years are over and unconsciously cut themselves off from new problems or both parents and teachers lower their expectations and demands because of overprotection. We did not find that less well-educated parents had more difficulties in mobilizing extra help for their children than relatively well-educated parents. Children of the former displayed developmental problems more often, but they received extra help and assistance in the same ratio as children of relatively more highly educated parents. Based on this line of reasoning a possible overrepresentation of children of less well-educated parents in the unassessed group would not change the degree of concordance between the follow-up results and school outcomes.
28
]. This examination classified 120 (34%) of the children participating in this study with neurological problems (disabling cerebral palsy, non-disabling cerebral palsy, minimal neurological dysfunction and gross motor retardation). Ninety-five (93%) of these children were also classified as problematic by one or more of the other instruments. While these neurological data provide a more complete picture, they do not improve the degree of concordance between school outcome and follow-up outcome (70%).
29
].
Schools are doing quite well in identifying children with and without developmental problems, but the need for longitudinal multidisciplinary follow-up programmes in different developmental domains remains. Information that promotes the understanding of the development of these children during their school career provides schools and parents with more tools for early detection and will facilitate the design and evaluation of intervention programmes.
