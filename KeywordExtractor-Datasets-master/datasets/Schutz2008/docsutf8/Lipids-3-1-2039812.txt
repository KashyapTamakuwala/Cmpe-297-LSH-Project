In patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), intestinal activation of the transcription factor NF-κB as well as intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 expression, which is involved in recruiting leukocytes to the side of inflammation is increased. Moreover, colonic arachidonic acid (ARA) proportions are increased and oleic acid (OA) proportions are decreased. Fish oils are protective in IBD patients however, a side-by-side comparison between effects of fish oils, ARA and OA has not been made. We therefore, compared effects of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) versus ARA and OA on ICAM-1 expression in Caco-2 enterocytes. To validate our model we showed that dexamethasone, sulfasalazine and PPARα (GW7647) or PPARγ (troglitazone) agonists significantly lowered ICAM-1 expression. ICAM-1 expression of non-stimulated and cytokine stimulated Caco-2 cells cultured for 22 days with ARA was significant higher as compared to EPA and OA. Furthermore, ARA increased NF-κB activation in a reporter cell-line as compared to EPA. Antibody array analysis of multiple inflammatory proteins particularly showed an increased monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1 and angiogenin production and a decreased interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-10 production by ARA as compared to EPA. Our results showed that ARA but not EPA and OA activates NF-κB and elevates ICAM-1 expression in Caco-2 enterocytes. It suggests that replacement of ARA by EPA or OA in the colon mucosa might have beneficial effects for IBD patients. Finally, we suggest that the pro-inflammatory effects of ARA versus EPA and OA are not related to PPARγ activation and/or eicosanoid formation.

]. A side-by-side comparison of the n-3 PUFA EPA, the n-6 PUFA ARA and the n-9 MUFA OA on ICAM-1 expression and NF-κB activation of intestinal cells has, as far as we are aware of, never been performed. Therefore the aim of the present study was to compare the effects of EPA, ARA and OA on ICAM-1 expression and NF-κB activation in the human intestinal epithelial Caco-2 cell line in vitro.

Materials and Methods 
Reagents
Bovine serum albumin (BSA; endotoxin and fatty acid-free), sulfasalazine, dexamethasone, GW7647, oleic acid (OA), arachidonic acid (ARA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and indomethacin were obtained from Sigma Chemical Company (St Louis, MO). Troglitazone was purchased from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Recombinant human IL-1β and interferon (IFN)γ were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Mannheim, Germany). DMEM, trypsin, penicillin streptomycin (PS), sodium pyruvate (SP) and non-essential amino acids (NEAA) were obtained from Invitrogen Corporation (Paisley, UK). Fetal calf serum (FCS; South-American) was obtained from Greiner Bio-one (Frickenhausen, Germany).

]. First, effects of immune-suppressive pharmacological compounds (sulfasalazine, dexamethasone and troglitazone) were tested to validate the model. Although these pharmacologic compounds have known immune-suppressive effects, effects on ICAM-1 expression in Caco-2 cells have—as far as we know—not been reported before. Therefore, after Caco-2 cells were fully differentiated, medium was replaced by medium containing the compound of interest in combination with an inflammation-inducing cocktail consisting of the cytokines IFNγ (100 U/mL) and IL-1β (50 U/mL). The compounds of interest were pre-incubated 30 min (sulfasalazine) or 2 h (dexamethasone, troglitazone or GW7647) before stimulation with the cytokine cocktail. After 16 h of cytokine stimulation, cells were used to determine cell surface ICAM-1 protein expression.

 cells) was added and incubated for 30 min on ice in the dark. Next, cell suspensions were centrifuged for 5 min at 1,500 rpm and pellets were resuspended in 500 μL PBS-1% BSA. The amount of fluorescence of 10,000 living cells was counted and analyzed with the FACSort and CellQuest analysis software (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ).

Stable Transfection of NF-κB in Caco-2 Cells
For evaluating the effects of the various interventions on transcriptional activity of NF-κB, a stable NF-κB reporter Caco-2 cell line was created. The 6κB-TK-luciferase (NF-κB reporter) plasmid and neomycin resistance plasmid were both kindly provided by Dr. R.C. Langen (Department of Pulmonology, Maastricht University, The Netherlands). Cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen Corporation, Paisley, UK) according the manufacturers’ instructions. Positive clones were selected by culturing with geneticin (1 mg/mL). To determine luciferase activity, non-stimulated and 3 h cytokine (100 U/mL IFNγ and 50 U/mL IL-1β) stimulated cells were lysed in luciferase lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI) and stored at −80 °C. Luciferase (Promega) activity was measured according to the manufacturers’ instructions and expressed relative to total protein (Bio-rad assay; Bio-rad, Hercules, CA).

]. Fatty acids were separated on an Autosystem (Perkin-Elmer, Norwalk, CT) gas chromatograph that was fitted with a silica-gel column (Cp-sil 88 for FAME, 50 m × 0.25 mm, 0.2-μm film thickness; Chrompack, Middelburg, The Netherlands) with helium gas (130 kPa) as the carrier gas. Both the injection and detection temperatures were set at 300 °C. The starting temperature of the column was 160 °C. Ten min after injection, the temperature was increased up to 190 °C at a rate of 2.5 °C/min. After 20 min at 190 °C, the temperature was increased up to 230 °C at a rate of 4 °C/min. The final temperature of 230 °C was maintained for 10 min. Data were analyzed by using CHROMCARD software (version 1.21; CE Instruments, Milan, Italy). The fatty acid compositions of the Caco-2 cells are expressed in relative amounts (% of total fatty acids identified; w/w).

Inflammatory Protein Expression Profiles Using an Antibody Array
Protein expression patterns of multiple cytokines, chemokines and growth factors, were detected simultaneously in Caco-2 cell culture media with the human cytokine antibody array III (Ray Biotech Inc., Norcross, GA) according to the manufacturers’ instructions. First, duplicates of cell culture media of Caco-2 cells cultured with ARA and EPA after cytokine stimulation were pooled. One millilitre of the pooled samples was added to the array membranes. After incubating and washing, the protein-bound membrane was incubated with a cocktail of biotin-labeled antibodies, followed by the addition of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin. Array spot intensity was detected by using a LAS-3000 Lite Image reader (Raytest GmbH, Straubenhart, Germany) based on chemiluminecence imaging. Intensity of the spots was quantified in arbitrary units (a.u.) by densitometry using Aida software version 3.50 (Raytest GmbH), thereby correcting for background staining of the gel. Comparison of protein expression profiles was possible after normalization of each spot on an array using the positive controls, provided by the manufacturer. The sensitivity of the array is not the same for the various proteins. Differences in heights of bars from different proteins do therefore not necessarily represent differences in concentrations. The cytokines used for stimulation (IFNγ and IL-1β) were excluded from analysis.

Detection of ICAM-1 on Caco-2 Frozen Sections
To determine the localization of ICAM-1 in our in vitro Caco-2 cell model, Caco-2 cells were cultured and differentiated into small intestinal enterocyte on collagen-coated polyfluoroethylene transwell membrane inserts with a 0.4 μm membrane pore size (Corning Costar, Cambridge, MA). Differentiated Caco-2 cells were stimulated with IFNγ (100 U/mL) and IL-1β (50 U/mL) for 16 h, embedded in Tissue-Tek (Sakura Finetek, Zoeterwoude, The Netherlands) and rapidly frozen in 2-propanol (Fluka, Zwijndrecht, The Netherlands), dry-ice-cooled and stored at −80 °C. Serial cryosections (10 μm) were obtained using a Leica CM3050 cryostat (Leica Microsystems GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany) and thaw mounted on uncoated glass slides. Before processing or storage at −80 °C, the samples were air dried overnight. To detect ICAM-1 the sections were incubated 30 min in the dark at room temperature with recombinant-phycoerythrin (R-PE)-conjugated mouse–anti-human CD-54 monoclonal antibody or isotype-matched control antibody (Becton Dickinson Biosciences, San Diego, CA) 1:50 diluted in PBS-1% BSA. To detect cytokeratin (CK)-19 the sections were simultaneously incubated with a monoclonal antibody directed to CK-19, kindly obtained from Dr. E.B. Lane (University Dundee, Dundee, UK) 1:10 diluted. Then the sections were washed three times for 5 min in PBS. After that the secondary antibody goat anti-mouse IgG1 (ALEXA555) (Molecular Probes Europe, Leiden, The Netherlands) (1:500) against anti-CD54 (to evade fast quenching of the PE-label) and goat anti-mouse IgG2b (FITC) (Southern Biotech, Sanbio BV, Uden, The Netherlands) (1:50) against CK-19 diluted in PBS-1% BSA was added to the sections and incubated for 30 min. Again the sections were washed three times for 5 min with PBS. Finally, sections were mounted in Mowiol-TRIS pH 8.5 (Calbiochem, Omnilabo International, Etten-Leur, The Netherlands) containing 0.5 g/mL 4–6-diamino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Molecular Probes Europe) to stain the nuclei. All sections were examined using a Nikon E800 fluorescence microscope (Uvikon, Bunnik, The Netherlands) coupled to a Basler A101C progressive scan colour CCD camera. By just a simple shift in filters, images were grabbed in fluorescence using the ALEXA excitation filter (540–580 nm), the FITC excitation filter (465–495 nm) and DAPI UV excitation filter (340–380 nm) in the red, green and blue channel, respectively. The images acquired were merged to examine the cellular localisation and level of expression of ICAM-1.

]. However, our study is the first that examined effects of EPA versus ARA on ICAM-1 expression and NF-κB activation in enterocytes. We however, realize that, although enterocytes play an important role in intestinal inflammation, immune modulating effects of fatty acids in CD patients will be influenced not only by enterocytes, but also the interaction with other intestinal immune and non-immune cells is important. Therefore, in future experiments effects on other cell types, e.g. isolated from mucosal biopsies of CD patients should be evaluated. Moreover, to validate if the effects of EPA versus ARA are also applicable in the pathogenesis or even the treatment of CD patients, these effects should be confirmed in appropriate animal models of IBD.

]. Therefore, we used OA as a reference fatty acid to make total fatty acid concentrations between experimental fatty acid conditions iso-molaric, i.e. OA was exchanged for ARA or EPA. In addition, we evaluated the condition of OA only. The results of this latter condition showed that decreasing ARA levels in the mucosa seems to be more important than increasing EPA levels.

]. Therefore, although PPARγ activation certainly protects against inflammation, our results do not suggest that the protective effects of EPA and OA as compared to ARA on intestinal inflammation are PPARγ-mediated. Therefore, there should be another explanation why effects of OA and EPA were comparable but different from those of ARA.

] showing that in endothelial cells the effects of DHA on VCAM-1 expression could not be inhibited by indomethacin, although prostacyclin production was completely suppressed. Therefore, we fully agree that in an in vivo situation pro-inflammatory effects of ARA are probably mediated by eicosanoids synthesized from ARA, however, these effects are not derived from a direct eicosanoid mediated activation of NF-κB as shown in our model.

In conclusion, we have shown that ARA but not EPA and OA activates NF-κB and elevates ICAM-1 expression in Caco-2 enterocytes and we hypothesize that the effects are not related to PPARγ activation or eicosanoid formation.
