Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights

, p. 3]. As the declaration is non-binding, this universal foundation will be implemented at the level of the nation-state. The onus is on UNESCO’s member states to incorporate the declaration’s provisions into their national laws, regulations or policies. This paper examines the synergies between the declaration and bioethics regulation in two countries, Kenya and South Africa.

], including Kenya and South Africa.
The objectives of this paper are twofold. The first is to assess the translation of universal principles into national practice. The comparison between the UNESCO declaration and Kenyan and South African bioethics forms the basis for this analysis. The second is to locate the ‘added value’ of the declaration, particularly to developing countries, given the pre-existence of international level bioethics documents. Empirically based, the paper draws on documentary evidence and interviews conducted in Kenya and South Africa in 2005 and 2006.

Background
The empirical research for this paper was carried out as part of a larger doctoral project on the global governance of human genomic and biomedical research and in particular the part developing countries play in this. The theoretical framework for this project is provided by international relations, a sub-discipline of political science. While international relations theory is not referred to overtly in this paper’s analytical sections, it provides the context for the understanding of universality contained therein. That is, universality is explored pragmatically, with regard to the relationship between broad principles negotiated at international level and their subsequent adaptation to national level policy and practice, rather than philosophically, in terms of universal versus pluralist moral reasoning.

 Of these 70 interviews, the data used in this paper draw on only 22 and come mostly from those with members of research ethics committees. Thus they are illustrative rather than representative.

 It is worth noting that the research process became by default an awareness-raising exercise, in that many of the people interviewed were previously unaware of the bioethics declaration, or indeed its predecessors.

It covers a wide range of bioethical principles, several of which had already become customary in bioethics and feature in documents such as the Helsinki declaration and the CIOMS guidelines (informed consent, for example). Some of the principles of particular relevance to developing countries will be elaborated further below.

Synergies between the UNESCO Declaration and Bioethics in Kenya and South Africa
As the UNESCO declaration is non-binding, if its principles are to be applied universally they will necessarily have to be reflected in national level documents and systems. This section compares the main tenets of the declaration that are of special relevance for developing countries with Kenyan and South African bioethics policy and practice. The comparison has two purposes. The first is to illustrate how internationally determined, universal principles might be implemented at national levels in developing countries. The second is to show to what extent these principles were already reflected in national systems, before the adoption of the declaration.

Generally they prefer a project to train people to analyse data in-country (interviews, K_17:2005, K_21:2005, K_25:2005, SA_19:2006, SA_21:2006 and SA_30:2006).

Universal Principles in the National Context
The South African guidelines read:

Something which became more and more legalistic in the detail and binding but which ignored local realities would be unhelpful. Something which tried to establish clear, agreed principles, which had been widely consulted, not just between member states, but with the kind of communities that are affected, would be very useful. (Interview, K_07:2005)

In South Africa, one ethics committee member thought that, given different cultural contexts and sensitivities, declarations such as the UNESCO one would have to be formulated as generally as possible to enable universal applicability (interview, SA_08:2006). Another was of the view that national and local ethics guidelines are “the things to follow,” because what is applicable in one country may not be applicable in another (interview, SA_19:2006). Several saw at least some value in the UNESCO endeavour, but cautioned that universal principles must not be applied unthinkingly. Perhaps mirroring ten Have’s prediction that elaboration of the declaration will be a long process, they described how working out how to apply such principles in different contexts is often the most challenging aspect of implementing international instruments (interviews, SA_10:2006, SA_17:2006 and SA_24:2006).

]. In Kenya and South Africa, where policy-makers and ethics committees have looked to these two documents for guidance at the global level, several of those interviewed were unconvinced that the UNESCO declaration, which they saw as simply another international instrument on bioethics, was necessary. As the declaration was adopted only relatively recently, such perceptions may change as both its contents and its intergovernmental status become more widely established (particularly as it construes bioethics in broader terms than only medical research ethics).

 Perhaps UNESCO’s ethics programme could help with training in these areas or encourage better funding, however. As highlighted by Singer and Benatar, capacity building is likely to advance research ethics further than are reformulations of bioethical principles. It may be, then, that the added value of the declaration will prove to lie more in UNESCO’s follow-up activities than in the document itself, at least in the medium term, the innovative sections on social responsibility and benefit sharing notwithstanding.

Conclusion
This paper has revealed something of a loose consensus, at least between UNESCO and those involved in bioethics in Kenya and South Africa, on two counts. With regard to universal principles, any attempt to implement them at national levels must be contextualised. Working out how to apply such principles in particular social and economic contexts is arguably as challenging as reaching agreement on how they should be constituted in the first place. With regard to the usefulness of the UNESCO declaration, the significance of its adoption as the first intergovernmental instrument on bioethics must be matched by action in the form of capacity building for it to be of added value in the realm of biomedical research ethics.
The scope of this paper has been limited to a primarily pragmatic analysis of how universal principles can be applied at national level. The paper has not commented on whether the value of the universality that UNESCO has aimed towards in terms of a foundation for humanity is compromised if these applications are very different. Deeper reflection on the nature of universality in this context would require the input of trained bioethicists and philosophers. This paper highlights, then, the need for a cross-disciplinary approach to the analysis of international bioethics instruments. The scope of the study that engendered this paper was necessarily limited by the time and resource constraints of doctoral research. Further research could explore whether the experiences of other African countries have been similar to those of Kenya and South Africa. Francophone and lusophone states, in particular, may have quite different bioethical traditions and thus have had very different experiences in implementing bioethics policies.

Thirty interviews took place in Kenya, 34 in South Africa, 3 in the United Kingdom and 3 in France. The 6 non-Africa-based interviews were with people involved in the negotiation of the UNESCO declaration.

The term ‘ethicist’ denotes both members of ethics committees and academic ethicists. While not all those interviewed who sat on ethics committees had been trained in bioethics as a philosophical discipline, all those interviewed who had received such training sat on at least one ethics committee.

Note that these categorisations are somewhat arbitrary, there being some overlap between sectors. One Kenyan scientist interviewed also acts as an advisor to both the national government and UNESCO, for example.
