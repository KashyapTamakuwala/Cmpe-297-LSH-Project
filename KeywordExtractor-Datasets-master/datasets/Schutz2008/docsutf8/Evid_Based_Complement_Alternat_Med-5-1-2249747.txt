Reduced glutathione or simply glutathione (γ-glutamylcysteinylglycine; GSH) is found in the cytosol of most cells of the body. GSH in the epithelial lining fluid (ELF) of the lower respiratory tract is thought to be the first line of defense against oxidative stress. Inhalation (nebulized or aerosolized) is the only known method that increases GSH's levels in the ELF. A review of the literature was conducted to examine the clinical effectiveness of inhaled GSH as a treatment for various pulmonary diseases and respiratory-related conditions. This report also discusses clinical and theoretical indications for GSH inhalation, potential concerns with this treatment, its presumed mechanisms of action, optimal doses to be administered and other important details. Reasons for inhaled GSH's effectiveness include its role as a potent antioxidant, and possibly improved oxygenation and host defenses. Theoretical uses of this treatment include Farmer's lung, pre- and postexercise, multiple chemical sensitivity disorder and cigarette smoking. GSH inhalation should not be used as a treatment for primary lung cancer. Testing for sulfites in the urine is recommended prior to GSH inhalation. Minor side effects such as transient coughing and an unpleasant odor are common with this treatment. Major side effects such as bronchoconstriction have only occurred among asthma patients presumed to be sulfite-sensitive. The potential applications of inhaled GSH are numerous when one considers just how many pulmonary diseases and respiratory-related conditions are affected by deficient antioxidant status or an over production of oxidants, poor oxygenation and/or impaired host defenses. More studies are clearly warranted.

 < 0.001) and returned toward baseline levels by 2 h. Despite this short-term increase in GSH concentrations within the ELF, the inhalation method did not significantly increase the amount of GSH in the lung lymph, venous plasma and urine during the 2 h study period. The authors of this report concluded that inhalation specifically increased GSH levels at the lung epithelial surface.
Given that inhalation is the only known method that increases GSH levels in the ELF for a significant duration, a review of the literature was conducted to examine the clinical effectiveness of inhaled GSH as a treatment for various pulmonary diseases and respiratory-related conditions. Only reports involving human subjects were included in the analysis. The clinical and theoretical indications for GSH inhalation were summarized and potential concerns with this treatment reported. Other pertinent details such as its presumed mechanisms of action and optimal doses to be administered were compiled and evaluated.

Methods
Literature Search
Computer searches were conducted of English and non-English language articles in the Biomedical Reference Collection (1984 to August 2006), CINAHL (1982 to August 2006), MEDLINE (1965 to August 2006) and Nursing and Allied Health Collection (1985 to August 2006) databases. Articles were searched with the key search terms ‘Nebulized Glutathione,’ and ‘Glutathione’ in combination with ‘Aerosol’ OR ‘Inhalation.’ These keywords were also searched with words related to pulmonary and/or respiratory disease. To supplement the search, references of the articles found from the initial search were reviewed. Hand searching of relevant journals was also completed as part of the search.

Selection of Articles
To be included in the final review, articles had to report on the use and administration of inhaled GSH for pulmonary diseases and respiratory-related conditions in human subjects. Only peer-reviewed articles were reviewed.

Discussion
Based exclusively on the published evidence included in this review, inhaled GSH is potentially indicated for the following clinical conditions: cystic fibrosis (CF), chronic otitis media with effusion (OME), HIV seropositive individuals, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and chronic rhinitis. These conditions were chosen since the published studies were of good quality, received A and B evidence grades, and their respective results demonstrated benefits from the use of GSH inhalation.

). Considering that not all chronic smokers go on to develop COPD, the authors in that review pointed out that genetic variations in the molecular mechanisms that regulate GSH metabolism might explain why some individuals are better protected against the development of COPD. It thus appears that emphysema patients are subjected to progressive tissue damage due, in part, to the consequences of GSH deficiency and/or genetic variations in GSH metabolism. Since GSH inhalation would presumably offer both antioxidant protection and GSH replenishment, this method of treatment would potentially benefit emphysema patients.
21
). These side effects were linked primarily to the production of sulfites that occurred when GSH was in solution. GSH inhalation should continue to be explored as a potential treatment for asthma. None of the asthma patients in the study had their urine tested for sulfites. A positive test for sulfites would have eliminated these patients from entering the study. Accordingly, the results might have been much more favorable if patients without sulfite sensitivities were included.

). Even though the exact percentage of sulfite-sensitive asthmatics is difficult to ascertain, sulfite sensitivity is an important factor to assess when using or evaluating research done on inhaled GSH.

). Fifteen symptomatic patients with FL [mean age, 42 ± 1 (SD) year] were compared with 10 AF [mean age, 43 ± 1 (SD) year] serving as the control group. All patients had baseline lung function testing and testing at various time intervals following hay exposures. The authors of this study concluded that FL and AF patients have characteristically different intrapulmonary levels of GSH, and that the pathogenesis of FL is likely related to GSH regulatory mechanisms. They also speculated that AF patients have a better ability to upregulate their pulmonary GSH levels, which would protect them against active disease. Clinical testing of inhaled GSH in patients with FL is warranted.
37
). By supplying more GSH to the lung tissues, more of this enzyme might be available to help reduce the production of free radicals associated with exercise. Although these assumptions are very speculative, it does seem possible and even logical that GSH inhalation would benefit those who regularly exercise by increasing exercise tolerance, and by maintaining and/or replenishing the antioxidant systems within the lungs.

). Glutathione inhalation may be ideal since the primary route by which patients with MCSD get triggered is through smelling and breathing. Sulfite sensitivity would have to be considered since inhaled GSH could provoke adverse events. This treatment might be capable of providing antioxidant protection to both the upper and lower respiratory airways, which would theoretically help to reduce the symptoms of MCSD and the production of peroxynitrite. More research studies are necessary.

Considerations Prior to Initiating GSH Inhalation
53
54
A random (fresh) urine sample is suitable, but a first morning void may be preferable due to its higher concentration. Once the test strip is dipped in the urine (for 1 s), the reaction zone changes color to indicate the concentration of sulfites present. After 30 s, the color on the test strip is compared to a color scale on the bottle indicating the concentrations of sulfites in the urine (can detect 10, 40, 80, 180 and 400 ppm of sulfites). The resultant concentration should be multiplied by a factor of 1.5 to provide the amount of free sulfites in mg/l (ppm). The strip will not detect below 10 ppm. The urine samples should be preservative free, and the urinary pH should also be tested with pH paper. If the urine pH is below 6, then the amount of sulfites might be underestimated by the test. In such cases, consider adding sodium acetate or sodium hydroxide to raise the pH to at least 7–10 (should not exceed a pH of 12), and then repeat with a new test strip.


If the urine test were positive for sulfites (normally they are absent), the use of inhaled GSH would be strictly contraindicated.

Method of Delivery, Recommended Daily Dosages and Side Effects
Table 3
27
). When patients are unresponsive to doses in the range of 600–1350 mg per day, it might be suitable to try doses that would replace half the estimated amount of GSH that is synthesized each day. These gram doses might yield better clinical results.
In terms of side effects, GSH inhalation is very safe. Minor side effects such as mild coughing and an unpleasant odor were reported in some of the studies included in this review. These minor side effects, better described as mild nuisance problems, were not severe enough to cause any of the study participants to discontinue treatment with inhaled GSH. The only worrisome or potentially life-threatening side effect to note is bronchoconstriction, which would be more likely to occur among sulfite-sensitive asthma and MCSD patients. However, if proper precautions such as sulfite testing are done prior to treatment, this serious side effect should be avoidable.

Monitoring the Clinical Response to Inhaled GSH
For pulmonary diseases or respiratory-related conditions, baseline pulmonary function testing with a spirometer or a simple peak flow meter is recommended prior to the first treatment. After a prescribed period of treatment time, pulmonary function tests should be repeated. This will help to establish if there are any clinical improvements from regular GSH inhalation.


Conclusions
GSH inhalation is an effective treatment for a variety of pulmonary diseases and respiratory-related conditions. Even very serious and difficult-to-treat diseases (e.g., CF, IPF) yielded benefits from this novel treatment. GSH inhalation is very safe, and rarely causes major or life-threatening side effects. The potential applications are numerous when one considers just how many pulmonary diseases and respiratory-related conditions are affected by deficient antioxidant status, poor oxygenation and/or impaired host defenses. More studies are clearly warranted.
