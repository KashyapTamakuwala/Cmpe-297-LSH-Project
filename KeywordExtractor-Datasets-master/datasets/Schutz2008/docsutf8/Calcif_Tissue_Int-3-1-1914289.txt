 hybridization on decalcified tibial sections. Endogenous IGFBP-2 mRNA was expressed in trabecular and cortical osteoblasts, some trabecular and subendocortical osteocytes, intracortical endothelial cells of blood vessels, and periosteum. Megakaryocytes, macrophages, and myeloid cells also expressed IGFBP-2 mRNA. Loading and sham loading did not affect IGFBP-2 mRNA expression in osteoblasts, bone marrow cells, and chondrocytes. An increase of IGFBP-2 mRNA-positive osteocytes was shown in loaded (1.68-fold) and sham-loaded (1.35-fold) endocortical tibial shaft. In conclusion, 6 hours after a single loading session, the number of IGFBP-2 mRNA-expressing osteocytes at the endosteal side of the shaft and inner lamellae was increased in squeezed and bended tibiae. Mechanical stimulation modulates IGFBP-2 mRNA expression in endocortical osteocytes. We suggest that IGFBP-2 plays a role in the lamellar bone formation process.

], which was confirmed by a time-course pilot experiment at our laboratory using real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis (H. W. van Essen, personal communication) showing the highest IGF-I mRNA expression 6 hours after loading. Since the actions of IGFs are influenced by their IGFBPs, we examined IGFBP-2 mRNA expression at 6 hours after loading. The tibiae were dissected and immediately fixed in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde (buffered in phosphate-buffered saline [PBS], pH 7.4) at 4°C for 24 hours.

Tissue
After fixation, the tibiae were decalcified in 10% ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) with 0.5% paraformaldehyde in PBS at 4°C for 4.5 weeks. Finally, the tibiae were washed in PBS and dehydrated through a series of ethanol and xylene at room temperature and embedded in paraffin.

Reagents
All restriction enzymes and modifying enzymes were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Mannheim, Germany), as well as digoxigenin-uridine triphosphate (UTP), antidigoxigenin Fab fragments, nitroblue tetrazolium chloride (NBT), 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (BCIP), and blocking reagent. Nylon membranes were purchased from Qiagen (Hilden, Germany). Polyvinyl alcohol was obtained from Aldrich (Milwaukee, WI). Euparal mounting medium was purchased from Chroma Gesellschaft (Waldeck, Division Chroma, Münster, Germany). Silane-coated glass slides were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO).
Mouse IGFBP-2 cDNA was kindly provided by Dr. S. L. S. Drop and Dr. J. W. van Neck (Department of Pediatrics, Sophia Children’s Hospital, Erasmus University, Rotterdam, The Netherlands) via Dr. S.

Sections were hybridized overnight at 53°C. After hybridization, sections were washed with 50% formamide in 2× SSC at the hybridization temperature for 30 minutes and treated with RNase A (1 unit/mL) for 30 minutes at 37°C.

 hybridization data. Sections I-V of all tibiae were scored in a semiquantitative manner, which was defined, on a Nikon Eclipse E800 microscope (Uvikon, Bunnik, The Netherlands), as follows: no expression (0), low expression (1), average expression (2), and high expression (3).
Effects of mechanical loading were expected in the shaft of the tibiae. Therefore, a second quantitative evaluation of the endocortical osteocytes expressing IGFBP-2 mRNA was performed with Lucia G Version 4.82 (Uvikon) using coded slides of sections II and III. The defined area of interest, which comprised the loading zone, started below the primary spongiosa at the endosteal side of the shaft following the total length of the shaft to the distal side (total length maximal 3,852 μm). At the endosteal side of the shaft, all osteocytes, which were positioned within 100 μm of the endosteal surface, were included in the area of interest. Within the area of interest, total osteocyte number and total IGFBP-2 mRNA-positive osteocyte number were measured.

Effects of Mechanical Loading on IGFBP-2 mRNA Expression in Osteoblasts, Chondrocytes, and Bone Marrow Cells
No differences in IGFBP-2 mRNA expression between loaded, sham-loaded, and control tibiae were observed in the osteoblasts, chondrocytes, and bone marrow cells by semiquantitative screening. No differences in morphology of the cells were observed between groups.


Discussion
in vivo
 study showed an increase in the number of endocortical osteocytes expressing IGFBP-2 mRNA in loaded (1.68-fold) and sham-loaded (1.35-fold) tibiae 6 hours after a single period of mechanical loading with the four-point bending system. The upregulation of IGFBP-2 mRNA expression was restricted to osteocytes at the endosteal side of the shaft and multiple inner lamellae. No difference between IGFBP-2 mRNA expression in the left and right control tibia was observed. We conclude that bending and squeezing of rat tibiae result in an increase of locally synthesized IGFBP-2 mRNA by endocortical osteocytes. We suggest that IGFBP-2 plays an as yet unidentified role in the lamellar bone formation process.

]. We suggest that IGFBP-2 mRNA may be less involved in woven bone formation because the osteocytes at the periosteal side of the shaft did not express IGFBP-2. This suggests that IGFBP-2 mRNA in the mechanosensitive osteocytes is specifically important for lamellar bone formation.
In addition, this study showed that the sham-loaded tibiae have increased IGFBP-2 mRNA production in endocortical osteocytes 6 hours after sham loading. Apparently, besides bending, squeezing alone is also responsible for the upregulation of IGFBP-2 mRNA in the endocortical osteocytes. However, squeezing did not induce lamellar bone formation.
Remarkably, there is a large range in the data for the percentage of IGFBP-2 mRNA-positive osteocytes in the contralateral control tibiae of the load group in comparison to the data of the contralateral tibiae of the sham group. This could be caused by the biological variation between the individuals because the animals were randomly divided between the groups and there is no significant statistical difference between those tibiae.

. We conclude that these IGFBP-2-producing osteocytes in the endosteal shaft are mechanosensitive. We suggest that IGFBP-2 plays a role in the lamellar bone formation process.
