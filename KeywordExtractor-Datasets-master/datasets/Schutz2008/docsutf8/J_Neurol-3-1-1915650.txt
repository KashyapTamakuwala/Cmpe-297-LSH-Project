Tremor is estimated to occur in about 25 to 60 percent of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). This symptom, which can be severely disabling and embarrassing for patients, is difficult to manage. Isoniazid in high doses, carbamazepine, propranolol and gluthetimide have been reported to provide some relief, but published evidence of effectiveness is very limited. Most trials were of small size and of short duration. Cannabinoids appear ineffective. Tremor reduction can be obtained with stereotactic thalamotomy or thalamic stimulation. However, the studies were small and information on long-term functional outcome is scarce. Physiotherapy, tremor reducing orthoses, and limb cooling can achieve some functional improvement. Tremor in MS remains a significant challenge and unmet need, requiring further basic and clinical research.

Search strategy and selection criteria
References for this review were identified from searches of Pubmed (from 1966 to 2005) and the Cochrane Library (2005, Issue 2) with the search terms “multiple sclerosis”, “tremor”, “ataxia”, “disability”, “prevalence”, “surgery”, “thalamotomy”, “deep brain stimulation” and “treatment”. Articles were also identified through searches of the reference tables of identified papers. Furthermore we searched the ISI Science Citation Index for relevant articles citing identified papers. Only articles in English and German were included in the review; publications in abstract form were not considered.

Introduction
Tremor is such a common problem in multiple sclerosis (MS) that the famous French neurologist Charcot (1825–1893) described it as a part of his triad of characteristic symptoms in MS, together with nystagmus, and scanning speech.
Tremor of the upper limbs can be very disabling and seriously impair many activities of daily living and quality of life. In practice the treatment of tremor in MS is often frustrating. In this review we discuss medical, surgical and other treatment options.
Epidemiology

]. As patients were selected from a specialist clinic, the relatively high prevalence and severity of tremor might be due to selection bias.
74
]. Probably the community based population in the latter study gives a more realistic estimate of tremor prevalence in MS. In both studies, however, tremor was associated with greater disability as measured on the expanded disability status scale (EDSS). In the Olmsted County population, patients with tremor of any severity were more likely to be unemployed or retired early because of disability.

Tremor subtypes

29
]. In MS, the two most prevalent tremor forms are postural tremor (tremor present whilst voluntarily maintaining a position against gravity) and intention tremor (tremor occurring during target directed movement where tremor amplitude increases during visually guided movements towards the target). True rest tremor (tremor present in a body part that is not voluntarily activated and is completely supported against gravity) is unusual in patients with MS, and Holmes (or “rubral”) tremor is also very uncommon.

Pathophysiology of tremor
The pathophysiology of tremor in MS is a difficult area of investigation, partly because MS is by definition a multifocal disease, so that tremor occurrence cannot easily be linked to a single neuroanatomical site. Systematic postmortem studies on the link between lesion site and the clinical phenomenon of tremor have never been undertaken.
The predominance of action tremors (postural and intention) in patients with MS point to the cerebellum and its connections as the most likely source of tremor production, whereas the rarity of rest tremor argues against an involvement of the basal ganglia. The common occurrence of bilateral tremor might indicate that damage to the cerebellum and its connections is often multifocal.
30

]. The authors argue that this effect might have been partly due to decreased muscle spindle function and decreased nerve conduction velocity, which in turn resulted in decreased input into tremor producing cerebellar circuits.

], whereas other authors do not mention this effect.
19
20
] The results of these animal studies suggest that damage to cerebellar efferents (through lesions of the dentate nucleus or superior cerebellar peduncle) may cause disinhibition of thalamic nuclei which are the main producers of intention tremor.
Although this is an interesting pathophysiologic model of intention tremor production, it remains uncertain whether the results of animal studies can be generalized to patients with MS.
In summary, clinical observation, animal studies and some experimental evidence in humans favour the cerebellum and the thalamic nuclei connected to it as the major locus of intention tremor production, but more research is needed to evaluate the role of the basal ganglia and other systems in tremor production in MS.

Accelerometry and polarized light goniometry are neurophysiologic methods of tremor assessment. While these methods offer an objective measurement of tremor severity, they can only measure one aspect of an often complex movement problem at a time, and e.g. cannot measure the ataxia which often complicates tremor in MS.

]. Ten patients were in each group. Interestingly, after a mean follow-up period of 15 to 16 months, patients in the thalamotomy group had a better outcome (tremor reduction: 78% for postural tremor and 72% for intention tremor) than patients in the DBS group (tremor reduction: 64% for postural tremor and 36% for intention tremor). However, as there were more adverse effects in the thalamotomy group, no clear recommendations could be given.
Adverse events reported for the neurosurgical interventions comprised increase of hemiparesis, dysarthria, dysphasia, mental changes, depression, seizures, intracerebral haemorrhage, subdural haematoma, wound infection and MS relapse. Thalamotomy was associated with a higher risk of adverse events than DBS. Bilateral thalamotomy carries such a high risk of adverse effects, that it is no longer recommended. If bilateral treatment is necessary, either bilateral DBS or unilateral thalamotomy followed by contralateral DBS are possible treatment options.

Other treatment options
Electromagnetic fields, limb cooling, physiotherapy, weight bracelets, orthoses and specialized software have been advocated as additional treatment options.

Conclusion
The treatment of tremor remains a great challenge for everyone caring for patients with MS. Drug treatment with currently available medication is unsuccessful in most cases and much more research on the pathophysiology and biochemistry of tremor production in MS will be necessary before an efficient medical treatment can be developed. Stereotactic surgery can be an effective means to treat severe tremor, but it is currently uncertain whether lesional surgery or DBS is the treatment of choice. Larger clinical trials comparing both interventions are needed. Other treatment options, including physiotherapy, tremor reducing orthoses, and limb cooling can lead to valuable improvements in activities of daily living.
