B–E, broadly similar distributions of sequence length are observed within the six different groups between three different continents, suggesting that sequences generated in these different studies shared the same set of structural features. Specifically, MFK* (carried at PoLV1 in group 1) and *REY (carried at PoLV2 in groups 2 and 5) are associated with short sequences in each geographical region. No examples of sequences with both MFK* and *REY motifs were found, suggesting that these motifs are mutually exclusive. In addition, though *REY motifs were found in sequences with 2 or 4 cysteine residues (cys2 or cys4), with the exception of a single cys4 (group 4) sequence from the Philippines, MFK* motifs were found exclusively in cys2 (group 1) sequences.

Since the cysteine/PoLV system of classification is based on commonly occurring sequence features it is hoped that it will useful for initial analysis and annotation, comparison of different geographical regions over time and identification of unusual sequences.

). Visual inspection of such sequences suggests the existence of chimeric DBL1α/DBL1α1 domains (for example PFF0010w and PF08_0140 in 3d7). The existence of mosaic domains highlights the need for a strictly defined classification that is specific to DBL1α sequence tag regions that are sampled in field studies]. Numbers of sequences in each comparison are shown above each column.
