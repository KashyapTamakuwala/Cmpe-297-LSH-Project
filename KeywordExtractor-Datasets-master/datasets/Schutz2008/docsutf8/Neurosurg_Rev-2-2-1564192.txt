The MIB-1 staining index in 56 of 296 grade I meningiomas in WHO classification was
3.0; in 27 of 28 grade II; and in 17 of 18 grade III, respectively
. Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that male (odds ratio [OR], 2.374, p=0.003), recurrence (OR, 7.574, p=0.0001), skull base (OR, 0.540, p=0.035), calcification (OR, 0.498, p=0.019) were independent risk factors for a high MIB-1 staining index (≥3.0); age, symptomatic, volume, multiple, edema were not. Male, recurrence, non-skull base, absence of calcification are independent risk factors for a high proliferative potential. These should be taken into consideration when managing meningiomas.

]. When patients had multiple meningiomas, only the largest tumor was included. On the basis of conventional CT and bone window CT, patients were divided into two groups according to the low density area around the tumor and calcification in the tumor. A low density area due to surgical scar was not included in edema in patients with recurrent meningioma.

]. An avidin-biotin immunoperoxidase or simple stain MAX-peroxidase (Nichirei, Tokyo) technique was used to perform MIB-1 monoclonal antibody (DAKO, Denmark) assay in selected sections of each case. All tissue sections were examined at high-power magnification (×400). The number of cells stained positively with MIB-1 and the total number of tumor cells were counted in several representative fields containing more than 1,000 cells. Their ratio was indicated as the MIB-1 staining index (%).

Statistical analysis
All data were stored on a personal computer and analyzed using commercially available statistical software (SPSS version 12.0, SPSS Inc.). Chi-squired analysis was used to compare the MIB-1 staining index to characteristics of patients with meningioma. All variables were included in a logistic regression model to determine which variables were independently associated with a high MIB-1 staining index (≥3.0). Significance was judged at a value of p<0.05 for all analyses.

Discussion
We analyzed the relationship of the MIB-1 staining indices to the characteristics of 342 consecutive patients with meningioma surgically removed between 1995 and 2004 by logistic regression analysis. Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that male (odds ratio [OR], 2.374, p=0.003), recurrence (OR, 7.574, p=0.0001), skull base (OR, 0.540, p=0.035), calcification (OR, 0.498, p=0.019) were independent risk factors for a high MIB-1 staining index (≥ 3.0); age, symptomatic, volume, multiple, and edema were not.

Our findings show that male (odds ratio [OR], 2.374, p=0.003) was an independent risk factor for a high MIB-1 staining index. We also found a higher MIB-1 staining index in males even in grade I meningioma (MIB-1 staining index in 32 of 226 females, and in 24 of 70 males was        ≥ 3.0, p=0.0001, chi-squire test).

In conclusion, male, recurrence, non-skull base, absence of calcification are independent risk factors for a high proliferative potential. These should be taken into consideration when managing meningiomas.

Comments

Jürgen R. E. Bohl, Mainz, Germany
The aim of this investigation on 342 patients with meningiomas was to determine the clinical and radiological features related to their proliferative capacity using the MIB-1 staining index. This seems to be justified as other authors had found, that in cases of meningiomas with a MIB-1 index of 3 or more percent the tumor volume doubling time was less than 2 years (see reference No. 12: Nakaguchi et al.). Therefore it would be of great benefit for all therapeuticstrategies to know some independent risk factors for a high growth rate of a meningioma prior to surgical intervention and histopathological investigation.
H. Kasuya et al. could demonstrate by using a logistic regression model that in their carefully documented series of 342 meningiomas there were four independent risk factors for a high proliferative potential. These were male, tumor recurrence, non-skull base localization and absence of calcification. Age, symptomatic behaviour, tumor volume, multiplicity and peritumoral edema proved not to be independent risk factors.
In general a lot of scientific work has been done in order to predict the outcome of a disease, especially to determine the prognosis of tumor patients. All people and institutions involved in the therapy or cure of a tumor disease want to know: How long will the patient survive?
Primarily the grading of brain tumors was based on clinical observations of survival rates and mortality diagrams. The grading of meningiomas according to the WHO-classification of brain tumors takes into consideration not only the mitotic activity and the proliferation indices but also some other histopathologic characteristics, that had proved to be important concerning the course of the disease. The survival rate was the essential criterion for evaluating the importance of many different features.
Thus it happened, that in the series of H. Kasuya et al. there were 56 of 296 grade I meningiomas with a MIB-1 staining index of greater than 3%, and that in the groups of grade II and even grade III meningiomas there were two tumors (2 out of 46) with a low proliferation index (less than 3 %). Under the assumption that the grading of tumors reflects the clinical course of the disease, these observations hint to the fact, that the proliferating potential of a tumor is not the only and perhaps also not the most important property of a tumor, in concern to the outcome of the disease.
These statistically established phenomena of a tumor disease are of an inestimable value for therapeutic decisions; but we always should bear in mind, that in a very single case, in a patient just sitting in front of you, all these well known “facts” might be totally wrong and not suitable at all. Because the patient and his tumor (the tumor and its host) are performing always a very individual symbiotic process that is unique in the world.

Kaoru Kurisu, Hiroshima, Japan
The authors analyzed the relationship of MIB-1 indices to characteristics of 342 consecutive patients with meningioma surgically removed between 1995 and 2004 in Tokyo Women’s Medical University by logistic regression analysis. The MIB-1 staining index in 100 of 342 meningiomas was equal to or bigger than 3.0;56 of 296 were grade I using the WHO classification, 27 of 28 grade II, 17 of 18 grade III. The authors concluded that male, recurrence, non-skull base location and absence of calcification are independent risk factors for a high proliferative potential of meningiomas from the results of MIB-1 staining of each operative specimen. This is a very clear and important conclusion. As there are in Japan many CT scanners and MRI machines and all people living in Japan have medical insurance with relatively low cost, people can be easily checked by CT or MRI when they present with minor symptoms such as slight headache or vertigo. The chance is thus high to detect meningiomas almost incidentally. Recently in Japan, it was found that meningioma is the most common primary brain tumor (Report of Brain Tumor Registry of Japan, 1969–1996, 11th Edition). According to the registry in 1996, the incidences of meningiomas, all gliomas, pituitary adenomas and schwannomas are 27.8%, 22.8%, 18.3% and 9.6%, respectively. This tendency of incidences of each brain tumor has been lasting for several years. On the other hand, I recognize that glioma is the most common primary brain tumor in other countries in the world. Additionally, the life expectancy of Japanese people is one of the longest in the world. The rate of people older than 65 years out of the total population of Japan will be one fourth in 2015 by statistical inference. It is, therefore, important to know the natural course of each brain tumor to make enough and beneficial informed consent to the patients with brain tumors. I believe this paper provides us the proper information for patients with meningioma. Presently, we usually check patients with an incidentally found meningioma by control image after 3 months to exclude the progressive subtypes like atypical or anaplastic meningioma.
