Objective
This study aims to question the generally accepted cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) bulk flow theory suggesting that the CSF is exclusively absorbed by the arachnoid villi and that the cause of hydrocephalus is a CSF absorption deficit. In addition, this study aims to briefly describe the new hydrodynamic concept of hydrocephalus and the rationale for endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) in communicating hydrocephalus.

Critique
The bulk flow theory has proven incapable of explaining the pivotal mechanisms behind communicating hydrocephalus. Thus, the theory is unable to explain why the ventricles enlarge, why the CSF pressure remains normal and why some patients improve after ETV.

Hydrodynamic concept of hydrocephalus
Communicating hydrocephalus is caused by decreased intracranial compliance increasing the systolic pressure transmission into the brain parenchyma. The increased systolic pressure in the brain distends the brain towards the skull and simultaneously compresses the periventricular region of the brain against the ventricles. The final result is the predominant enlargement of the ventricles and narrowing of the subarachnoid space. The ETV reduces the increased systolic pressure in the brain simply by venting ventricular CSF through the stoma. The patent aqueduct in communicating hydrocephalus is too narrow to vent the CSF sufficiently.

The hydrodynamic concept of hydrocephalus

]. Acute hydrocephalus is caused by an intraventricular CSF obstruction in accordance with the conventional view. As opposed to that view, it is suggested that chronic hydrocephalus is caused by decreased intracranial compliance.
Causes of decreased intracranial compliance
 Although the etiology of the decreased intracranial compliance such as CSF obstructions at the foramen magnum and adhesions in the subarachnoid space after intracranial bleedings, trauma, operations and infections is well known, the etiology remains unknown in many idiopathic and congenital cases of hydrocephalus. However, the final stage of chronic hydrocephalus, independent of its etiology, is uniform. The final stage is characterised by narrow capacitance vessels and reduced cerebral blood volume. This reduces cerebral blood flow, reduces intracranial compliance and enhances the intracerebral pulse pressure.
Intracerebral pulse pressure theory of chronic hydrocephalus

]. The increased systolic pressure in the brain is the cause of the distension of the brain and ventricles. The systolic expansion of the brain distends the brain towards the skull and simultaneously compresses the periventricular region of the brain. The rationale result is the predominant enlargement of the ventricles and a narrowing of the subarachnoid space.
Rationale for ETV in communicating hydrocephalus
 As described above, communicating hydrocephalus is caused by decreased compliance increasing the systolic pressure transmission into the brain. The systolic force compresses the brain including the intracranial capacitance vessels, i.e. the cerebral veins and capillaries. This results in a vicious cycle with narrow capacitance vessels and significantly reduced cerebral blood volume that causes further decrease in intracranial compliance and further increase in intra-cranial pulse pressure. It is obvious that an endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) may interrupt the vicious cycle and reduce the systolic pressure in the brain simply by venting ventricular CSF through the stoma. The patent aqueduct in communicating hydrocephalus is too narrow to vent the ventricular CSF sufficiently. By reducing the pulse pressure, the ETV also reduces the compression of the capacitance vessels thereby restoring some degree of venous compliance, which in turn reduces the intracerebral pulse pressure further.

]. In patients shunted under 1 year of age, ETV should be considered as an alternative treatment when they grow older. However, the final answer as to which is the optimal treatment must be based on randomized clinical studies.

]. The associated CSF malabsorption is a secondary phenomenon to the decreased intracranial compliance. The only residue of the conventional view is acute hydrocephalus, which is caused by a CSF absorption deficit (of the periventricular capillaries). Normal-pressure hydrocephalus, aqueductal stenosis as well as communicating hydrocephalus in infants and adults are typical manifestations within the spectrum of chronic hydrocephalus. It should be emphasised that chronic hydrocephalus is an unstable hemodynamic disorder occurring at normal or slightly increased mean intracranial pressure with superimposed vascular pressure waves that can be fatal.
The theory may thus have identified decreased intra-cranial compliance as a new and potential universal cause of chronic hydrocephalus. Decreased compliance is common to all different types of chronic hydrocephalus whatever their etiology. If the theory is correct, there is hope for improved treatment of chronic hydrocephalus of unknown etiology. How come then that treatment failure rather is the rule than the exception of this devastating condition? The reason may be that shunting and ETV essentially represents symptomatic treatments of hydrocephalus. To improve therapy, we have to find treatments that are more effective in increasing compliance in cases with unknown etiology or are directed against the cause of the decreased compliance in cases with known etiology.
