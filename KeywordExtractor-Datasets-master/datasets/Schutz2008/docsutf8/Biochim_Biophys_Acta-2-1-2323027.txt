Abstract
Xenopus
Xenopus
1.
The cytoplasmic polyadenylation machinery such as CPEB, the subunits of cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF), symplekin, Gld-2 and poly(A) polymerase (PAP).

2.
The signal transduction that leads to the activation of CPE-mediated polyadenylation during oocyte maturation, including the potential roles of kinases such as MAPK, Aurora A, CamKII, cdk1/Ringo and cdk1/cyclin B.

3.
The role of deadenylation and translational repression, including the potential involvement of PARN, CCR4/NOT, maskin, pumilio, Xp54 (Ddx6, Rck), other P-body components and isoforms of the cap binding initiation factor eIF4E.



Finally we discuss some of the remaining questions regarding the mechanisms of translational regulation by cytoplasmic polyadenylation and give our view on where our knowledge is likely to be expanded in the near future.

5
The activation of cytoplasmic polyadenylation
Xenopus
[71–73]
. A rapid drop in cyclic AMP leads to the inactivation of protein kinase A, which is necessary for the induction of cytoplasmic polyadenylation. In recent years, progress has been made in various aspects of the activation mechanisms of cytoplasmic polyadenylation, although the picture is far from complete.
Xenopus
[62]
[57]
[57]
[74]
[74]
[74]
[74]
. There are two possibilities to explain the action of PARN on CPE containing mRNAs, either Gld-2 continuously adenylates while PARN takes these nucleotides off, or the presence of PARN blocks Gld-2 activity, for instance by preventing access to the 3′ end of the mRNA.

.
[15,17,48]
[17,32]
[21]
[15,16,32,79,80]
. However, there remains the possibility that the same signal transduction pathways ultimately activate Musashi and CPEB, which would make it impossible to distinguish between the effects of the two proteins in these experiments, with the possible exception of the CPEB antibody injection. With the limitations of the currently available evidence, it seems safest to assume that Musashi and CPEB both contribute to the polyadenylation of early mRNAs and that some mRNAs may be exclusively dependent on one or the other. Further work is required to resolve this issue definitively.
Xenopus
[17,81]
[32,48,82]
[74]
[15,32,83]

. Evidence for a requirement of CamKII activity early in oocyte maturation would be necessary to make this more than speculation. However, Aurora A is very active later in oogenesis and it is undeniably capable of activating CPEB. It therefore appears likely that at the very least the maintenance of CPEB phosphorylation on Ser174 is carried out by this kinase.

While the association with amyloid precursor proteins may have great significance for the role of CPEB and cytoplasmic polyadenylation in neurons, it is as yet unclear whether APLP1 or its relatives are required for cytoplasmic polyadenylation in oocytes and whether it mediates the membrane association of the cytoplasmic polyadenylation complexes.

Figs. 1 and 2
1.
The activation of CPE-mediated cytoplasmic polyadenylation during progesterone induced oocyte maturation is induced by a drop in protein kinase A activity and requires an early translation event, perhaps translation of RINGO/Speedy.

2.
This induces the early activation of MAP kinase, which is associated with the polyadenylation complex through XGef and phosphorylates CPEB on multiple sites, but not on Ser174.

3.
CPEB is phosphorylated on Ser174 by an as yet not fully confirmed kinase, possibly Aurora A or CamKII, which is required for the induction of CPE-mediated polyadenylation and causes an increase in the binding between Gld-2, CPSF and CPEB, causing the ejection of PARN from the complex and allowing Gld-2 to elongate the poly(A) tail of the mRNA.

4.
After GVBD, CPEB is phosphorylated by cdk1 and the free CPEB is mostly degraded, allowing the CPEB in polyadenylation complexes (now probably phosphorylated on Ser174 by Aurora A) to activate cytoplasmic polyadenylation on mRNAs which contain a CPE overlapping with the poly(A) signal.



[16,75,76]
[71]
[19,26]
[104]
[105]
. A system with so much positive feedback will require strong brakes, and it appears that at least in some cases this is provided by deadenylation factors, as discussed below.

6
Deadenylation and translational repression
[74,106]
[74,106]
. However, RNA substrates containing CPEs alone have not been tested in these experiments and it is therefore not clear if a CPE is sufficient for deadenylation or if other sequence elements are required. In fact almost all CPE containing mRNAs have putative binding sites for other deadenylation factors.

 embryos through another deadenylase, for instance the CCR4–Pop2–Not complex. No direct contacts between CPEB containing and EDEN containing complexes has been described so far. Because CPEs, EDEN sequences, Musashi and Pumilio binding sites often occur in the same 3′ UTR, their associated complexes can be expected to compete for the end of the mRNA to mediate deadenylation or polyadenylation.

At present it is difficult to choose amongst the multitude of models for translational repression by CPEs. Some of the complexes detected by pulldown and immunoprecipitation may not contain the majority of the repressed mRNA, even though presence of some mRNA was demonstrated by RT-PCR. Alternatively, it may well be that every one of these models is correct at a particular stage of oogenesis or embryogenesis or that the repression is different for specific mRNAs, depending on binding sites for other proteins such as Pumilio and EDEN-BP. An attractive option is that sequestration to P-body like large complexes is the result of translational repression and acts as an enhancer of translational repression, while smaller, more mRNA specific translational repression complexes are formed during the movement of mRNAs in and out of P-bodies. To distinguish between these models, it will be important to characterise the cap binding proteins and P-body components present on specific mRNAs at different developmental stages.

Cytoplasmic polyadenylation and translational activation
[150]
Xenopus
[29,74]
[6,13]
[76]
. This suggests that, at least for the translation of c-Mos mRNA, both the presence of a poly(A) tail and an additional, polyadenylation independent, modification of the mRNP are required for translational activation.

Discussion
Xenopus
1.
A more systematic investigation of the consensus CPE sequence and its maximum distance to the poly(A) signal would enable a more reliable bioinformatic prediction of the targets of CPE-mediated cytoplasmic polyadenylation. Are all mRNAs containing these sequences polyadenylated during oocyte maturation?

2.
The relative roles of Gld-2 and PAP in cytoplasmic polyadenylation need to be further evaluated. Can they substitute for each other? What are their contact points in the cytoplasmic polyadenylation complex? A cytoplasmic polyadenylation system reconstituted from pure components would be ideal to resolve these questions.

3.
The kinase(s) responsible for the early activating phosphorylation on Ser174 of CPEB should be identified unequivocally. If Aurora A is responsible, why do inhibitors of its activity not block oocyte maturation and can no early activation of this kinase be detected? Do inhibitors of CamKII affect early polyadenylation? What is the signal transduction cascade leading to induction of the activating kinase?

4.
What are the relative roles of Musashi and CPEB in the polyadenylation of c-Mos mRNA and other substrates? How do dominant negative mutants of CPEB and Musashi achieve their repressive functions? May there be off target effects through titration of common polyadenylation factors or signal transduction machinery?

5.
in vitro
 or in a 2 hybrid system, as this could lead to predictions for the functions of dominant negative mutants and potentially clarify how different complexes are assembled.

6.
Are the complexes on cytoplasmic polyadenylation sequences other than the CPE similar to the CPEB associated complexes? For instance, do Gld2 or PAP associate with the RNA binding proteins that recognise them?

7.
Which models for translational repression and deadenylation of CPE containing mRNAs are correct in what stage of oogenesis? Again, a more intimate knowledge of the direct interactions involved in assembling the repression complexes is likely to yield important new investigative tools for resolving this question. In addition, the study of mRNP complexes assembled in vivo could yield some more conclusive answers.

8.
Are the polyadenylation and translation repression complexes identical for each CPE containing mRNA or are there mRNA specific differences in the complexes? Immunoprecipitation followed by RT-PCR and RNA affinity chromatography can partially answer this question, but affinity purification methods that target specific mRNPs are likely to be crucial to obtain a full answer.



Xenopus
 oocyte and egg systems. These systems are very good for biochemical assays both in injected oocytes and egg extracts and they provide ample material for purification and identification. However, the high levels of stable maternal proteins make clean knock down or knock out experiments impossible in most cases, which has led to a heavy reliance on dominant negative approaches. To resolve some of the outstanding issues we are therefore likely to have to look to vertebrate genetic systems such as mouse and/or to develop tissue culture based cytoplasmic polyadenylation systems that are amenable to siRNA knock down, for instance using neuronal cells or cells synchronised in the cell cycle.

Fig. 1
The activation of CPE-mediated cytoplasmic polyadenylation. In immature oocytes, CPE containing mRNAs already contain all the proteins necessary for polyadenylation as well as the deadenylase PARN. During oocyte maturation, phosphorylation of CPEB causes a rearrangement of the complex that leads to the ejection of PARN and the activation of the poly(A) polymerase Gld-2. 4E: eIF4E, 4A: eIF4A. For further description of this process, see the text.
