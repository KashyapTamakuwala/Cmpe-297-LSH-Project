, and A1 receptors. Enzyme histochemistry revealed that ATP but not adenosine 5′-diphosphate (ADP) is extracellularly metabolised in retinal slices of NTPDase1 knockout mice. NTPDase1 activity and protein is restricted to blood vessels, whereas activity of alkaline phosphatase is essentially absent at physiological pH. The data suggest that NTPDase2 is the major ATP-degrading ectonucleotidase of the retinal parenchyma. NTPDase2 expressed by Müller cells can be implicated in the regulation of purinergic calcium responses and cellular volume.

]. The aim of our study was to investigate whether extracellular nucleotide metabolism is implicated in the inhibitory effect of ATP on the osmotic swelling of Müller cells, to determine the types of ectonucleotidases expressed by Müller cells and whether the retinal expression of ectonucleotidases is altered after transient retinal ischaemia reperfusion.

The secondary antibodies were Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin (Ig)G (1:400; Dianova), Cy2-coupled goat anti-mouse IgG (1:200; Dianova), Cy3-coupled donkey anti-goat IgG (1:200; Dianova) and Cy2-coupled donkey anti-mouse IgG (1:200; Dianova).

]. Animals had free access to water and food in an air-conditioned room on a 12-h light–dark cycle. Transient retinal ischaemia was induced in one eye of the rats, whereas the other eye remained untreated and served as control (three animals). Anaesthesia was induced by intramuscular ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine(5 mg/kg). The anterior chamber of the treated eye was cannulated from the pars plana with a 27-gauge infusion needle connected to a bag containing normal saline. The intraocular pressure was increased to 160 mmHg for 60 min by elevating the saline bag. The animals were killed by carbon dioxide 3 days after reperfusion, and the eyes were removed.

Müller cell swelling

]. The stock solution of the dye was prepared in dimethylsulfoxide and resolved in saline. The slices were examined with a confocal laser scanning microscope (LSM) LSM 510 Meta (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Mitotracker Orange was excited at 543 nm, and emission was recorded with a 560 nm long-pass filter. In the course of the experiments, the somata of Müller cells were recorded at the plane of their maximal extension.

, 10 hydroxyethylpiperazine ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) and 11 glucose, adjusted to pH 7.4 with Tris. The hypotonic solution (60% of control osmolarity) was made up by adding distilled water. Barium chloride was added to the extracellular solution and was preincubated for 10 min. Blocking substances were preincubated for 15–45 min, and agonists were administered simultaneously with the hypotonic solution.

) were placed in a perfusion chamber and incubated for 1 h at room temperature in extracellular solution containing the calcium-sensitive fluorescence dye Fluo-4/AM (11 μM). After 10 min of washing by continuous perfusion of extracellular solution, ATP was added by a fast change of the perfusate. ARL-67156 was preincubated for 25 min. Fluo-4 was excited at 488 nm; emission was recorded with a band-pass filter between 505 and 550 nm.

Immunohistochemistry
Isolated rat retinas were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 2 h. After several washing steps in buffered saline, the tissues were embedded in saline containing 3% agarose (w/v), and 60-μm-thick slices were cut by using a vibratome. For double labelling, the slices were incubated in 5% normal goat or donkey serum plus 0.3% Triton X-100 in saline for 2 h at room temperature and, subsequently in a mixture of primary antibodies overnight at 4°C. After washing in 1% bovine serum albumin, secondary antibodies were administered for 2 h at room temperature. Control slices were stained without primary antibodies; no unspecific labelling was observed following incubation with secondary antibodies (not shown). Images were taken with the LSM.

Immunocytochemistry
To prepare suspensions of dissociated cells, isolated rat retinas were stored for 30 min in saline containing 0.4 mg/ml papain (Boehringer, Mannheim, Germany) at 37°C. After fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min and washing with saline, the tissues were triturated with a pipette until single cells were dissociated. The cells were blocked and permeabilised for 30 min with 5% normal goat serum and 0.3% Triton-X 100, followed by incubation with primary antibodies for 6 h at 4°C. After washing in 1% bovine serum albumin in saline, the secondary antibodies were applied for 1 h at room temperature.

An apparent upregulation of the immunoreactivities in the inner retina [ganglion cell layer (GCL), inner plexiform layer (IPL), inner nuclear layer (INL)] may be caused by the strong decrease in thickness of the inner retinal layers (in particular, of the IPL), which is a typical degeneration pattern of rodent retinas after transient ischemia.

] that activation of A1 receptors causes the opening of potassium and chloride channels in the Müller cell membrane; thus, the cells extrude potassium and chloride ions, which is associated with a water efflux that prevents swelling under hypoosmotic conditions. Considering the results presented in this study, the extracellular enzymatic degradation of ATP to ADP might play a crucial role in the purinergic cascade involved in the autocrine regulation of the Müller cell volume.

] is unclear and remains to be solved in future investigations. It cannot be ruled out that pharmacological modulation of the glial purinergic signalling may also indirectly alter neuronal activity via alterations of the glial cell volume and, therefore, of the extracellular space volume. Moreover, differences in the local microenvironment and the spatial relationship of ectonucleotidases, purinergic receptors and transporter molecules may explain some of the different findings.

]. Additional investigations are required to determine the functional roles of NTPDase2 and ecto-5′-nucleotidase in the reciprocal signalling between neurons and glia in the retina.
