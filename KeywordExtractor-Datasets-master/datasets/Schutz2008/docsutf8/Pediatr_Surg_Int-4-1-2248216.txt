Intestinal malrotation (IM) and cardiovascular defects (CCVD) are both common congenital defects. We investigated the prevalence and types of CCVD in a 25-year IM population, and its association with post-IM-operative morbidity and mortality. Data on the type of CCVD, other congenital defects, syndromes, associations, post-IM-operative morbidity and mortality were retrospectively reviewed from the records of IM patients born between 1980 and 2005. Data were analyzed on (significant) differences between CCVD subgroups, and risk factors for both morbidity and mortality were calculated. Seventy-seven of 284 IM patients (27.1%) were diagnosed with a major or minor CCVD (37 and 40 patients, respectively). Syndromes and associations were more frequently diagnosed in patients with major than with a minor CCVD (67.6 vs. 40%, respectively). Post-IM-operative complications, although frequently observed (61%), did not differ between patients with major and minor CCVD. Physical CCVD signs before IM surgery increased post-IM-operative morbidity significantly (OR 4.0, 95% CI 1.4–11.0). Fifteen patients died (19.5%), seven due to cardiovascular cause. Mortality risk was increased by intestinal ischemia and post-IM-operative complications and by major CCVD after correction for age at weight at the time of IM operation. Congenital cardiovascular defects in children with intestinal malrotation are common, with high morbidity and mortality rates after IM operation. Elective IM surgery in young patients with CCVD should be performed in a centre with adequate paediatric cardiac care. Benefits of laparoscopic intervention need further study.

]. However, the incidence of CCVD in IM patients has not been precisely quantified in the recent literature and the full array of the associated cardiac anomalies has not been well described.
The purpose of our study was (1) to delineate and accurately describe the types and incidence of associated cardiac lesions in our most recent 25-year experience of patients with IM, and (2) to study the influence of a co-existing CCVDs on IM surgery morbidity and mortality.

Materials and methods
Population
A retrospective review at a single university centre was conducted on all the paediatric patients diagnosed with IM born and      between September 1980 and September 2005. Patients with CCVD were identified for further analysis. Patients demographics recorded included gestational age, weight and gender. Data on the type of CCVD, other congenital defects, known syndromes or associations, post-operative complications, morbidity and mortality were collected. The diagnosis of CCVD was based on clinical, ECG, echocardiography, heart catheterization and peri-operative findings. The IM diagnosis was based on radiological upper gastro-intestinal examination, or during acute surgery.

For the calculation of risk factors for both post-operative morbidity and mortality, (adjusted) odds ratios (OR) with consequent 95% CI were calculated by uni- and multi-variate regression analysis. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software (version 12.0.1; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).


Results
Demographics
During a period of 25 years, 284 patients were diagnosed in our centre with IM. Ninety-three of the 284 patients were identified with CCVD as well. Fifteen patients had persistent pulmonary hypertension (PPHT), all but one with congenital diaphragmatic hernia. One patient had a solitary pre-duodenal portal vein. The records of these 16 patients without structural CCVD were excluded, leaving 77 patients with both IM and CCVD (27.1% of the total IM population in the last 25 years) for further analysis. The gestational age range was 26–42 weeks with a median of 39 weeks. Median birth weight was 2.86 kg (range 0.72–4.53). A female predominance was seen with 47 girls (61%) and 30 boys (39%). Median follow-up period after IM diagnosis was 2.8 years (range 0–24 years). The overall survival at the end of follow-up was 80.5% (15 out of 77 patients died).

Correction for age and weight at the time of IM surgery in both CCVD groups showed, although not significant, a clear trend in post-IM-operative morbidity risk in patients diagnosed major CCVD (OR 2.9, 95% CI 0.9–9.6). Patients with pre-operative signs of CCVD had a four times increased risk on post-operative complications (95% CI 1.4–11.0). This risk factor was more prominent after correction for age and weight at the time of IM surgery (OR 8.2, 95% CI 2.1–30.7).

]. The current study showed that patients with a CCVD had a relatively high morbidity rate after IM surgery (61.1%). Syndromes, associations or the presence of other congenital malformations were not found to be risk factors for post IM morbidity. Cardiovascular complications were seen in 18.1% of our population. There are neither data on prevalence of cardiovascular complications after IM surgery in the general paediatric population, nor on influence of physical condition prior to IM surgery on the morbidity after the operation. Although the type of CCVD was not significantly associated with an increased risk on morbidity, there was a clear trend (towards increased risk on post-operative morbidity) in patients with major CCVD. Furthermore, patients with pre-operative physical signs of CCVD had a high post-operative morbidity rate (77%).

In the current study, the mortality rate was higher: almost one-fifth of the patients died. Patients who died were significantly younger at the time of IM surgery. Other risk factors for death were major CCVD (after correction for age and weight at the time of IM surgery), ischemic bowel at the time of IM surgery, post-IM-operative complications in general and post-IM-operative cardiovascular complications.

], even in patients with major CCVD. Referral to a centre equipped with paediatric cardioanesthesiological care is imperative.
Study limitations
This is a retrospective study of all consecutive live-born IM patients referred to a single university centre over a 25-year period. There are asymptomatic IM patients who never consult a doctor. Patients with IM and a very mild CCVD might have been missed. Screening for CCVD in IM patients could give us more information on the exact prevalence of CCVD in IM patients. Furthermore, since CCVD are very common congenital defects, a prospective study on the prevalence of IM in all patients with minor and major CCVD would also be of great interest.
Each retrospective study has its limitations, e.g. some variables were not (yet) available; e.g. syndromes and associations were common in our study population. Yet, the actual prevalence of syndromes might have been higher than reported. Certain syndromes and associations are quite new and nowadays there might be more attention on searching for a fitting syndrome or association diagnosis than 20 years ago.

].


Conclusion
The prevalence of CCVD in patients with IM is high (27.1%). Major and minor CCVDs are both frequently seen. Major CCVD is a risk factor for death after IM operation. Since morbidity and mortality rates in IM patients with CCVD are much higher than previously reported, a pre-operative screening for co-existing CCVD is indicated. Elective IM surgery in young patients with major CCVD should be conducted in a centre with adequate paediatric cardiac care. The benefit of laparoscopic intervention needs further follow-up.
