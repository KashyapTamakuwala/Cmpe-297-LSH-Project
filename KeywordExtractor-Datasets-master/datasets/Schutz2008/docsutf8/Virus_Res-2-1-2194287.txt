Introduction

). SFV genomic RNA (so-called 42S RNA) is approximately 11.5 kb long and encodes four non-structural proteins designated nsP1–4; these are involved in viral RNA synthesis. The remaining proteins form the virus capsid and envelope and are not essential for virus replication.
Strauss and Strauss, 1994
). The early replicase mediates synthesis of the negative-stranded RNA complementary to the genomic 42S RNA. Minus strands are used by the late replicase as templates for the synthesis of new positive strand 42S RNA, and for transcription of subgenomic mRNAs encoding the structural proteins.

BHK-21 cells were infected and samples collected as described above. After SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, probed with rabbit polyclonal antisera against SFV nsP1, EGFP (in-house), HcRed (Clontech), with a mouse monoclonal antibody against Bcl-2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) or with a mouse monoclonal antibody against beta-actin (C4) (Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) and visualized by ECL immunoblot detection kit (Amersham Life Science).

Analysis of the viability of AT3 cells infected with SFV VLPs

 AT3-neo or AT3-bcl2 cells were infected with VLPs in serum-free RPMI1640 media supplemented with 0.2% BSA. The amount of VLPs used for infections corresponded to a moi = 20 for BHK-21 cells. At 12 h p.i., EGFP positive cells were separated using a BD FACSAria cell sorter; EGFP-positive cells were seeded in 24-well plates. Viable cells were determined at 24 and 48 h p.i. using Trypan blue (Flow Laboratories).

e). This is in agreement with previous observations suggesting that the highest expression levels of the second target proteins are achieved with SFV-d1EGFP-EMCV vectors. The apparent delay in detection of protein expression (2 h p.i. for Bcl-2 versus 4 h p.i. for HcRed) is most likely due to the quality of the HcRed antibody (Clontech).
Thus, vectors containing IRES elements expressed Bcl-2 earlier and to higher levels. Presence of a duplicated subgenomic promoter or IRES element following the Bcl-2 encoding sequence did not have any major effect on the time-course of infection, however, differences in expression levels of the first marker protein, d1EGFP, were observed.

a). Most of the transfected cells were dead 3 days post-transfection regardless of the replicon. Thus, our results demonstrate that high-level expression of Bcl-2 does not protect BHK-21 cells against SFV induced death. Similar results were also obtained when Annexin-V PE conjugate or propidium iodide were used to label apoptotic and necrotic cells (data not shown).

This tendency was also seen when cells infected with SFV-d1EGFP-EMCV-HcRed, SFV-d1EGFP-CR-HcRed and SFV-d1EGFP-PR-HcRed VLPs were analyzed by WST-1 assay (data not shown), indicating that not Bcl-2 expression, but rather the second gene expression unit (especially EMCV-IRES) is responsible for this effect. Taken together, our results suggest that Bcl-2 expression does not have a detectable effect on the viability of SFV-infected BHK-21 cells.

b). Since cell sorting ruled out the possibility of non-infected cells being present in analyzed samples, we concluded that AT3-bcl2 cells, infected with SFV replicons were either able to recover from infection or, alternatively, established a persistent infection. Our observation that surviving AT3-bcl2 cells rapidly lost EGFP fluorescence favours the first option. Expression of Bcl-2 by SFV replicons had little or no effect on survival and subsequent division of infected AT3-bcl2 cells. All results taken together we conclude that not bcl-2 expression as such but some other property of AT3-bcl2 cells is likely responsible for this phenomenon.

), may lead to adaptation of the cell, which in turn might affect virus replication and the outcome of infection. It is also important to mention that both transient and stable cellular expression are mediated by cellular RNA polymerase II and are, therefore, subjected to the alphavirus-induced transcriptional shutdown, which starts early in infection.

). Interference between the native subgenomic promoter and the duplicated promoter or IRES element may have influenced expression from the first promoter. It is also possible that presence of the IRES elements had some effect on replication. However, infectivity of bicistronic vectors was not altered. Taken together, these results indicate that different IRES elements can be used to construct novel and efficient bicistronic SFV vectors.

 cells/well) were collected, lysed and equal amounts of lysates analyzed by immunoblotting; beta-actin was used for normalization. Lysates of cells infected with SFV-PL-d1EGFP, SFV-d1EGFP-CR-bcl2, SFV-d1EGFP-EMCV-bcl2, SFV-d1EGFP-PR-bcl2 and SFV-d1EGFP-EMCV-HcRed VLPs are shown in panels a–e, respectively. Time of infection is shown at the top of each lane. Mock—mock-infected BHK-21 cells; lines at the left indicate positions of corresponding proteins; lanes at the right indicate positions of molecular mass standards. Experiments were repeated twice, with similar results.

Equal amounts of collected cell lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by autoradiography. Time of infection is shown at the top of each lane. Positions of molecular mass standards are indicated on the left, positions of SFV nsP1–nsP4, d1EGFP and Bcl-2 are indicated at the right. Arrow on panel D positions Bcl-2 expressed by SFV-d1EGFP-EMCV-bcl2.

Puromycin selection was applied at the 6 h post-transfection. (b) Measuring cell viability by WST-1 assay at 6, 24 and 48 h p.i. Absorbance at 450 nm was measured 1 h after adding WST-1 reagent.
