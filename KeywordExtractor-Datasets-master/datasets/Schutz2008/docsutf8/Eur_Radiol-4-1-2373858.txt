] also used a high temporal resolution (10.5–14.5 s) in the evaluation of small breast lesions and evaluated their data using a pharmacokinetic model. The incorporation of data from pharmacokinetic modeling in the evaluation of lesions improved diagnostic accuracy in their group.

]. These imaging protocols are, therefore, less suitable in clinical MRI or screening. For this study, we adjusted the scanning protocol in order to obtain a high temporal resolution during initial enhancement while covering both breasts entirely. The aim of this study is to asses the value of pharmacokinetic parameters derived from fast dynamic contrast enhanced imaging during initial enhancement in differentiating between benign and malignant breast lesions on MRI.

Materials and methods
Patient selection

]. Lesions that could not be classified as benign or malignant using these criteria were excluded. The protocol was approved by the institutional review board.

Imaging protocol
26
]. Prior to the MRI examination, an intravenous catheter was inserted in the left or right arm. All patients were placed in the prone position with the breasts in the double breast coil and positioned at the isocenter of the magnet. After localizer images were obtained in three directions, low spatial resolution proton-density-weighted images were acquired in the transverse plane covering both breasts completely (TE 1.56, TR 800, FA 8, FOV 320, slices 24, TA 50 s, image resolution 3.9 mm × 1.3 mm × 4.0 mm). Subsequently, a coronally orientated high-resolution three-dimensional fast low-angle shot series (FLASH 3D) was acquired (TE 4, TR 7.5, FA 8, FOV 320, slices 120, TA 86 s, image resolution 1.3 mm × 1.3 mm × 1.3 mm). Thereafter, high temporal resolution T1-weighted images (turboFLASH) were recorded 22 times with identical spatial resolution and orientation as the proton-density-weighted images (TE 1.56, TR 66, FA 20, FOV 320, slices 24, TA 22 × 4.1 s) during an intravenous bolus injection of a paramagnetic gadolinium chelate—0.2 mmol of gadoterate meglumine (Dotarem; Guerbet, The Netherlands) per kilogram of body weight—which was administered with a power injector (Spectris; Medrad, Pittsburg, USA) at 2.5 ml/s and followed by a 15-ml saline flush. Following these series, the FLASH 3D series was repeated four times. Total scan time for this protocol was 9 min 42 s, including the time needed to record localizer images.

Image evaluation
For the evaluation, the MRI data were divided into two sets of dynamic data for each patient. The first dataset contained the high spatial resolution T1-weighted images (FLASH 3D) only. These were used for the evaluation of both lesion morphology as well as signal intensity versus time curves. This method will be further referred to as the ‘slow dynamic’ analysis. The second dataset contained the proton-density-weighted images, the high temporal resolution images as well as the precontrast high spatial resolution sequence. A high-resolution subtraction of the pre- and first postcontrast FLASH3D series prepared on the MRI scanner was also included in this dataset to aid in lesion detection. The proton-density-weighted sequence was necessary for an accurate estimation of the T1 value necessary for the quantitative analyses. The evaluation of this dataset will be further referred to as the ‘fast dynamic’ analysis. In this fast dynamic analysis, the last three postcontrast FLASH 3D series were not used.
All cases were evaluated prospectively by two experienced breast MRI radiologists (reader 1 and reader 2). Both readers had over 5 years of experience in dynamic breast MRI. The evaluation on the two workstations was performed independently in different sessions with at least a 2-month time interval between both sessions.

Results
A total of 870 consecutive clinical breast MRI examinations in 787 patients were performed. In these studies a total of 188 lesions were detected. Eighty-six lesions could not be included due to lack of histological diagnosis or insufficient follow-up. This resulted in a total of 102 lesions in 96 patients; 34 benign and 68 malignant lesions. The mean age was 51 years (range 28–74 years). Ninety-four lesions were included based on histological evaluation, eight lesions based on follow-up. Mean lesion size on MRI for the malignant group was 32 mm (range 9–90 mm) and this was 15 mm (range 5–50 mm) for the benign lesions. A total of 52 lesions were 2 cm or smaller; 25 malignant (mean lesion size 14 mm, range 6–20 mm) and 27 benign (mean lesion size 11 mm , range 5–20 mm).

Imaging results
In the slow dynamic analysis reader 1 classified 25 lesions as a BI-RADS 2 (benign:malignant = 22:3), seven as BI-RADS 3 (4:3), 50 as BI-RADS 4 (6:44) and 20 an BI-RADS 5 (2:18). This was respectively 33 (24:9), 12 (4:8), 41 (5:36) and 16 (1:15) for reader 2. The ROC analysis for the slow dynamic analysis resulted in an AUC of 0.85 (95% CI = 0.773–0.918) and 0.83 (95% CI = 0.74–0.89) for reader 1 and 2, respectively.

). The diagnostic performance of the pharmacokinetic parameters was, compared with the results of the slow dynamic analysis, not significantly different. The combination of both methods, however, did improve the diagnostic performance significantly for both readers. These results were also found in the subgroup analysis of smaller breast lesions.

] evaluated the performance of both dynamic and morphological features in 854 women with 995 lesions. The results of their multivariate evaluation based on both morphological and relatively slow dynamic lesion characteristics resulted in a similar diagnostic accuracy (AUC values of 0.87 and 0.88) compared with the results obtained in the slow dynamic analyses of our study (0.85 and 0.83). Our results found in the slow dynamic analysis are, therefore, considered representative for the diagnostic performance of an experienced radiologist in this group of patients.

]. In our study, both readers were instructed with a simple ROI-placing strategy placing the ROI in an area with the highest parameter values guided by color overlays. Since no significant differences were found in the ROC analyses in any of the pharmacokinetic parameters used it is assumed that the performance of the fast dynamic analysis was not negatively affected by this manual ROI selection strategy. The optimal strategy of ROI selection within a breast lesion is a subject that still needs to be further investigated; this is beyond the scope of this study.

], only a relatively small number of benign lesions could be included. The diverse histological distribution also resulted in the inclusion of benign lesions that do not necessarily cause a diagnostic dilemma in daily practice. This can be seen as a limitation of our study. In the subgroup analysis of smaller lesions, a more equal distribution between benign and malignant lesions was found. The analysis performed in this subgroup also proved the additional value of the fast dynamic analysis in classifying small breast lesions on MRI.

]. This reduction of scantime can in the future contribute to the cost-effectiveness of MRI screening. However, since the highest diagnostic performance was obtained by combining both the fast and slow dynamic analysis, further studies are needed before the scantime can be reduced.
The results presented in this study are our initial results using this scanning protocol. Therefore, no cut of values for the differentiation between benign and malignant lesions from the pharmacokinetic parameters were used in the evaluation or can be provided at this point. The results presented only show the potential of our method in differentiation between benign and malignant lesions in this group of patients. The value of our method needs to be further studied in a larger group, preferably using a more even distribution between benign and malignant cases and with lesions that can be classified on imaging as a BI-RADS 3 or higher.
Unfortunately, the study design used did not allow a multivariate analysis combining the fast dynamic data with morphological characteristics. Also, the possible trade-off between the pharmacokinetic parameters based on initial enhancement and the wash-out based on late dynamic characteristics cannot be derived from these data. Both analyses will need to be performed in future projects in order to evaluate the full potential of the fast dynamic analysis as used in our study.In conclusion, pharmacokinetic parameters derived from fast dynamic imaging during initial enhancement have great potential in classifying enhancing lesions in the breast. In this study, the diagnostic performance for the fast dynamic analysis proved to be equal to the results of experienced radiologists using more common evaluation methods based on morphologic characteristics and slow dynamic enhancement characteristics. An increased diagnostic performance was found in combining both methods. This shows the additional value of this method in further improving the diagnostic accuracy of breast MRI.
