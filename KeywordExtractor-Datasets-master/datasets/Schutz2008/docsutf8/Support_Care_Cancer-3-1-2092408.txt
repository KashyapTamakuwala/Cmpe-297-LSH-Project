Goals of work
The current study was designed to longitudinally examine stress response symptoms (SRS) and quality of life (QoL) in couples confronted with disseminated testicular cancer. The objectives were to examine couples’ patterns of adjustment over time and possible differences in adjustment between the patient and his partner.

Materials and methods
Couples completed the Impact of Event Scale and the QoL subscales physical functioning, social functioning, and mental health of the RAND-36 before chemotherapy (T1), after completion of chemotherapy (T2), and 1 year later (T3).

Results
Before chemotherapy 26% of the patients and 50% of partners reported clinically elevated levels of SRS. Patients reported lower physical and social functioning at T2 compared to T1 and T3. Partners reported an improvement in social functioning over the year and no changes in physical functioning or mental health. No relationships between patients and partners’ functioning were found. One year after diagnosis, QoL of patients and partners was similar to that of reference groups, and patients even reported better physical functioning than the reference group. SRS of patients and partners were negatively related at T1, and patients and partners’ social functioning were positively related at T2.

Conclusions
According to stress response levels, the period before the start of chemotherapy was most stressful for couples. Adjustment patterns differ between testicular cancer patients and their partners with patients reporting lowered QoL after completion of chemotherapy. QoL of couples returned to normal levels 1 year after diagnosis. The effect of disseminated testicular cancer on the QoL of patients and their partners seems to be temporary. A minority may need clinical attention for severe SRS.

]. Also, couples are confronted with possible treatment-related infertility and sexual difficulties at a time in life where partners are often focused on starting a family. Couples may face several individual and dyadic stressors after the diagnosis of testicular cancer, leading to the experience of distress and lowered quality of life (QoL). This is particularly true when chemotherapy is part of the treatment protocol, as it is a more demanding treatment modality than surgery alone in the case of testicular cancer.

Goals of the present study were: (1) to explore differences and relationships between patients and partners’ SRS and QoL and to relate those to relationship aspects (duration and presence of children); (2) to examine change over time in SRS and QoL in patients and partners; (3) to relate earlier levels of SRS and QoL in patients and partners to later levels; and (4) to examine differences in QoL of patients and partners with that of a reference group of men and women.

Materials and methods
Procedure and participants
n
=30) could be included in this study. Other inclusion criteria were age over 18 years at study entry, sufficient command of the Dutch language, no previous treatment for cancer, and absence of a psychiatric history. The study was introduced to the patients and their partners after orchiectomy (removal of the affected testicle) was performed. Couples received a questionnaire at the following three time points: after orchiectomy but before the start of chemotherapy (T1), immediately after completion of chemotherapy, which is approximately 3 months after T1 (T2), and 1 year after T1 (T3). The patients received four cycles of cisplatin, etoposide, and bleomycin with a 3-week interval between each cycle. Couples received a letter with information about the objectives of the study, an informed consent form, the questionnaires, and a prepaid return envelope. Thirty of the 70 patients diagnosed during the above-mentioned time period appeared to meet all of the inclusion criteria. They and their partners were approached to participate in the study. Of the eligible 30 couples, 21 participated (70%). Two couples did not complete all three measurement times, therefore, only 19 couples provided complete data. The study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the UMCG.

Higher scores indicate more SRS. The Dutch version of the IES indicates a total score of more than 26 as severe SRS, for which psychological help is recommended. Reliability of this scale was good for patients (Cronbach’s alpha for the different measurement times ranged from 0.82 to 0.89) and for partners (Cronbach’s alpha for the different measurement times ranged from 0.78 to 0.93).

Lower physical functioning was reported by patients at T2 compared to T1, but physical functioning returned to baseline level at T3. Earlier levels of physical functioning in patients were not significantly related to later levels, and correlations were low. A decline in social functioning of patients was also found at T2 compared to T1, but higher social functioning than at baseline was found at T3. Social functioning of patients at T1 was positively and strongly related to functioning at T2, but the relationships between T2–T3 and T1–T3 were low to moderate. Mental health of patients improved over time. Mental health at T1 was positively and strongly related to levels at T2, and weakly to levels at T3. The relationship between mental health at T2 and T3 was moderately strong.

Discussion
The present study was the first to prospectively and longitudinally examine psychosocial functioning in both testicular cancer patients and their partners. We focused on SRS and QoL (physical functioning, social functioning, and mental health) after orchiectomy but before the start of chemotherapy, immediately after completion of chemotherapy, and 9 months later (1 year follow-up).
23
34
]. The majority of these studies used the same questionnaire for measuring SRS as we did. The same review identified younger age, greater proximity to diagnosis, more advanced disease, and greater treatment intensity as risk factors for a higher level of SRS. The much higher percentage found in our study at the first measurement time may be explained by the prevalence of these four risk factors in our patient group.
34
20
21
40
42
]. It was also found that partners who had children experienced more SRS a year after diagnosis compared to partners without children. This higher level of distress might also be a result of caregiving tasks that are often the domain of female partners.
22
]. All couples in this study received positive news about the results of treatment, and 1 year after diagnosis none of the patients had experienced a relapse of disease. Couples seemed to have recovered from this major life event over the year, possibly as a consequence of the success of treatment reducing insecurity about outcome.
40
]. Another possible interpretation might be that patients who expressed very low levels of distress were using denial, avoidance, or other repressive psychological mechanisms while their partners carried the psychological burden of stress. A patient who expresses high distress may also allow his spouse to assume a stronger supportive role, and thus reduce her expression of stress.
39
30
]. Partners of testicular cancer patients may have changed the evaluation of their own health in a positive way after witnessing the diagnosis and treatment of a life-threatening illness.
6
43
].
Mental health of patients improved over the year. It was poorer than that of men in the reference group but only before start of chemotherapy. Mental health of partners was comparable throughout the year and to that of a reference group of women, despite the high level of SRS they reported before start of chemotherapy. SRS apparently are a different expression of mental functioning and may be encapsulated or separated out.
24
]. Mental health of patients improved over the year. Spouses reported a decline in SRS and an improvement in social functioning, but no change in physical functioning or mental health over the year. Differences between patients and partners were also noticeable in stability of functioning. In patients, earlier levels of SRS were strongly predictive of later levels while less individual stability was found with regard to physical and social functioning and to mental health. Partners reported less individual stability in SRS over time, although individual stability was found between T2 and T3. However, partners were individually highly consistent in their reports of physical functioning and somewhat less strong in mental health and social functioning. In addition, correlations between the functioning of patients and partners were moderate to very low. We also found that at the second and third measurement time, there were no couples in which both the patient and the partner reported clinically elevated levels of SRS. This finding confirms the lack of correspondence in functioning between patient and partner.
19
20
]. Research is needed to examine if these different reaction patterns to a cancer diagnosis affect the marital relationship.
32
]. These moderating factors in adjustment of both patient and spouse deserve to be studied prospectively in the future.
16
31
32
]. Little correspondence was found in the functioning of the partners. Findings should be regarded as preliminary, as the study sample was limited in size. However, clinicians can be reassured that the effect of disseminated testicular cancer on the QoL of patients and their partners seems to be temporary, although a minority does seem to need clinical attention for SRS.
