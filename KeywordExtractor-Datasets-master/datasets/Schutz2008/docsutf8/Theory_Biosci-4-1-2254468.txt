Tree thinking is an integral part of modern evolutionary biology, and a necessary precondition for phylogenetics and comparative analyses. Tree thinking has during the 20th century largely replaced group thinking, developmental thinking and anthropocentricism in biology. Unfortunately, however, this does not imply that tree thinking can be taken for granted. The findings reported here indicate that tree thinking is very much an acquired ability which needs extensive training. I tested a sample of undergraduate and graduate students of biology by means of questionnaires. Not a single student was able to correctly interpret a simple tree drawing. Several other findings demonstrate that tree thinking is virtually absent in students unless they are explicitly taught how to read evolutionary trees. Possible causes and implications of this mental bias are discussed. It seems that biological textbooks can be an important source of confusion for students. While group and developmental thinking have disappeared from most textual representations of evolution, they have survived in the evolutionary tree drawings of many textbooks. It is quite common for students to encounter anthropocentric trees and even trees containing stem groups and paraphyla. While these biases originate from the unconscious philosophical assumptions made by authors, the findings suggest that presenting unbiased evolutionary trees in biological publications is not merely a philosophical virtue but has also clear practical implications.

). It was thus based upon the ancient idea that change in nature has an ultimate goal. This is incompatible with the irregular and divergent nature of evolution.
One might presume that the replacement of group and developmental thinking by tree thinking is of merely historical interest—a subject to be dealt with by historians of science, just as the replacement of essentialism by population thinking. To the contrary, I here argue that the transition of both group thinking and developmental thinking to tree thinking is still happening, and that it deserves more attention by those who teach phylogenetics and who communicate phylogenies. The transition is still happening in the sense that students of biology have to accomplish it in the course of their “academic ontogenies”: tree thinking is an ability that has to be acquired and cannot be taken for granted by teachers. Sadly, many text books indirectly and implicitly promote developmental thinking. This further aggravates the problem. Given the importance (even necessity) of tree thinking in order to fully appreciate the meaning of evolutionary results, this problem deserves attention.

Materials and methods
I devised a short questionnaire which was handed out during the first lesson in several classes of a university course in systematics and evolution (at Universitetet i Tromsø, Norway). The course was intended for students who had studied biology for several terms, but this was not a formal requirement. The students who followed normal progression had been taught evolutionary principles and processes in earlier courses. The same questionnaire was used in a similar course at a regional university college (Høgskolen i Bodø, Norway). The students were asked to answer the questions, using the time they needed, and were assured anonymity. They did not have access to any books or notes.

(The correct answer was “C, D, E and F”.)

“How many classes of vertebrates and angiosperms are there? Fill in the scientifically correct answer:...“(There is no scientifically correct answer to this question.)

“What are the differences between species and genera, or between orders and classes? Give one or more keywords that describe these differences. (a) Differences between species and genera:...(b) Differences between orders and classes:...“(The correct answer was that species differ from genera [and orders and classes], for instance by being populations within which gene flow can occur. The difference between orders and classes is merely one of definition, none of nature.)

“What does the ‘tree of life’ look like? Please draw the evolutionary tree which describes the relationships between groups of organisms. Include as many groups as you are able to recall”.

Results
Twenty one university students returned questionnaires that were at least partly answered. On average they had previously taken biology courses for 1.6 years of full time study load (median 1.5, range 0.3–4.0 years). Four were graduate students, the remainder were undergraduates. A further ten students of the regional university college returned the questionnaire.

Phylogenetic tree drawn by a university student. The question posed was “What does the ‘tree of life’ look like? Please draw the evolutionary tree which describes the relationships between groups of organisms. Include as many groups as you remember”. Note the prominent position of mammals and the unresolved “side branches”. Taxon names provided by the student were translated verbatim into English, the drawing itself is unchanged




Seven of 13 students depicted 1 to 9 extant taxa as stem groups in their drawings. A total of 14% of all names provided were drawn as stem taxa. 11 of 13 students drew 1 to 11 branches which they named with paraphyletic groups. A total of 31% of all names provided referred to paraphyla.

In their answers, the students proved to pay more attention to how the taxon names at the tree tips were ordered along the left–right axis, than to the topology of the cladogram. Given that the information of cladograms is conveyed in the branching order of taxa, while the left–right ordering is arbitrary, this wrong focus necessarily leads to wrong conclusions.
1978
:760) put it: “Cladograms are difficult enough for experts in the field to comprehend fully”. Ironically, what he was advocating as the obvious alternative was phylograms—which were meant to not only express phylogenetic relationships, but, in addition, phenotypic similarity, distribution through geologic time and species number. As such, phylograms are not only harder to interpret for untrained readers than cladograms. They may also convey incorrect information on any one of the aspects because they represent a two-dimensional compromise of several multidimensional measures.

. Unless told otherwise, they tend to make up their own explanations. As my results indicate, only a tiny proportion of students seems to question the existence and reality of Linnean categories. Of course, blank answers to question 2 do not necessarily indicate the deliberate rejection of categories—the two students may also have wished to give a number, but were unable to “recall the correct one”. On the other hand, question 2 was clearly a leading (not to say, loaded) question, which may have biased the respondents into thinking that a number was the only acceptable answer. Still, findings from question 3 show that at least 27% of the students perceive the distinction between “orders” and “classes” to be a reflection of real differences between natural levels of organisation.

). Even though the transition from developmental thinking to tree thinking is more or less completed in the science of systematics at the collective level, it has to be accomplished anew by every generation of biology students on the individual level. This must not be forgotten when teaching phylogenetics or writing or illustrating text books. Other topics that need to be addressed explicitly are the artificiality of Linnean categories, the non-existence of stem taxa, and the arbitrariness of paraphyla. It does not seem to be sufficient to “get the facts right” in teaching and text books. Students tend to fall back to group and developmental thinking unless explicitly told otherwise.

”). Furthermore, “most closely related” is a quite imperfect translation of “i nærmest slekt”. The Norwegian phrase implies a kinship or genealogical relation (comparable to the German “verwandt”). The English “related” is wider and also incorporates abstract relationships such as whole–part, group–element or simply similarities of any kind. The Norwegian word does not normally have these figurative connotations.
