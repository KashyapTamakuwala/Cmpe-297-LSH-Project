 lifecycle. In the more sedentary insect procyclic form (PCF) of the parasite, ARF1 is required for cell viability but depletion of the protein by RNA interference (RNAi) has no effect on the uptake of dextran by fluid-phase endocytosis. Instead, the lysosome becomes enlarged, although degradation of the protein p67 within this organelle is not significantly impaired.

 to produce the stable cell line 29-13/p2T7ARF1. Expression of ARF1-specific dsRNA was induced by incubating parasites in 100 ng/ml tetracycline. Expression of TbARF1 was monitored by quantitative PCR, using SYBR Green Mastermix (Applied Biosystems). Total RNA was extracted from parasites using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen), treated with DNase I (Ambion) and reverse-transcribed using Omniscript RT (Qiagen). A 66 bp fragment of TbARF1 was amplified using SYBR Green Mastermix (Applied Biosystems) on a Prism7000 (Applied Biosystems) and compared to levels of a constitutively expressed control, α-tubulin. Oligonucleotides for amplification were: TbARF1 RTF1, 5′-GGCTTCCGCTTTCAAATCC-3′, TbARF1 RTR1, 5′-CATCAAGGCCGACCATAAGAA-3′, TbαTub RTF1, 5′-CGTGAGGCTATCTGCATCCA-3′ and TbαTub RTR1, 5′-CCCAGCAGGCGTTACCAA-3′.

Microscopy

. Primary antibodies were gifts as follows: rabbit anti-TbGRASP from Graham Warren (Department of Cell Biology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA), mouse anti-p67 from Jay Bangs (Department of Medical Microbiology and Immunology, Madison, WI, USA). Primary antibodies were detected using Alexa-Fluor 488 or 633-conjugated secondary antibodies (Invitrogen). Samples were visualized by confocal microscopy using a Zeiss LSM 510 meta with a Plan-Apochromat 63x/1.4 Oil DIC I objective lens and images acquired using LSM 510 version 3.2 software (Zeiss).
For transmission electron microscopy, cells were sequentially treated in 1% (w/v) glutaraldehyde for 1 h, 1% (w/v) tannic acid for 10 min, 0.5% (w/v) osmium tetroxide for 45 min (all in 100 mM phosphate buffer), then in 1% (w/v) aqueous uranyl acetate for 1 h. After dehydration in an acetone series, cells were embedded in Spurrs resin. Sections were cut on a Leica Ultracut, stained with saturated uranyl acetate in 50% ethanol and Reynolds lead citrate, and viewed with a Tecnai 12 BioTwin (FEI) at 120 kV. Images were acquired with a SIS MegaView III digital camera.

/ml. Samples were then divided into two equal aliquots and anti-488 antibody (1:100, Invitrogen) added to one aliquot for 30 min at RT, before washing in PBS. Fluorescence was measured on a Dako Cytomation CyAn flow cytometer using the FL1 detector and results analyzed with Summit v4.1 software.

, and fluid-phase endocytosis is unaffected by the knockdown of TbARF1 expression. Rather than affecting the endocytic system, the absence of TbARF1 causes enlargement of the lysosome, indicating an accumulation of undegraded and/or mistargeted material.

, implying either a greater dependence on the remaining AP-1 and AP-3 complexes or the operation of additional uncharacterized sorting mechanisms.

. It is likely that p67 is sorted in PCF cells via binding to either AP-1 or AP-3 at the TGN, a process that could be inhibited by knockdown of ARF1. While the data presented here suggest that p67 continues to be targeted efficiently for degradation in the lysosome, this does not preclude a defect in the sorting or trafficking of other essential lysosomal factors.

. In this situation, excess ARF1 may be sequestering effector proteins required for alternative pathways which would normally facilitate the correct localization of p67.

. Further studies are required to pinpoint the relationship between TbARF1 and lysosomal function, analysis which may reveal insights into the secretory pathways of lower eukaryotes.
