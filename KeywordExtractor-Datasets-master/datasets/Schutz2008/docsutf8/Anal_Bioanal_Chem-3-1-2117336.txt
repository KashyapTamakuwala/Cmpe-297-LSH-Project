 horse cytochrome C was observed when the average residence time of the protein sample in a 140 cm ×50 μm capillary immobilized enzyme reactor (IMER) was 165 s. Mass spectrometric identification of the injected protein on the basis of the tryptic peptides proved possible. Protein digestion was favorable with respect to reaction time and fragments formed when compared with other on-line and off-line procedures. These results and the easy preparation of this micro-reactor provide possibilities for miniaturized enzyme-reactors for on-line peptide mapping and inhibitor screening.

]. The most time-consuming step in this procedure is digestion of the protein using a protease. In general, every protein to be investigated is individually incubated with the protease at a concentration of approximately 1–2% protein weight for 2 to 18 h at an elevated temperature (typically 37 °C). In addition to the long incubation time needed, a certain level of auto-digestion of the protease can be expected. To reduce sample handling, digestion time, and the risk of sample contamination, methods for the on-line digestion of proteins have been developed that use proteases immobilized on a solid support.

]. The surface modification resulting in the highest enzyme immobilization yield, was used to covalently immobilize the trypsin on the inside wall of a fused-silica capillary. The constructed trypsin micro-reactor, which is compatible with micro- and nano-LC, was further characterized. The influence of reaction time, pH, temperature, and reactor stability were investigated with the model substrate insulin B-chain. The reactor was also applied to digestion of the proteins cytochrome C and myoglobin. The produced peptides were analyzed by liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry.

Experimental
Materials
The SPR equipment used was from IBIS Technologies (currently available from Eco Chemie, Utrecht, The Netherlands) equipped with a 200-μL polycarbonate cuvet. The gold-sensor disks, purchased from SSENS (Hengelo, The Netherlands), were positioned on the IBIS-prism using index-matching oil from R.P. Cargille Laboratories (Cedar Grove, USA). PEEK nuts, unions, tubing, and loops were from Upchurch (Santa Monica, USA). Manual injections during the preparation of the reactors were performed using a Rheodyne 7010 injector (Inacom, Veenendaal, The Netherlands) equipped with a 1-mL PEEK loop. Model 10ADvp HPLC pumps from Shimadzu (Kyoto, Japan) were used for reactor preparation and activity determinations. The water used for washing and to prepare buffers was produced by a Sartorius Arium 611 ultrapure water system (Nieuwegein, The Netherlands; conductivity >18.2 MΩ cm). The model ABS759A UV absorbance detector was equipped with a capillary flow-cell (75-μm i.d.) and was obtained from Applied Biosystems (Nieuwerkerk a/d IJssel, The Netherlands).

Surface chemistry and enzyme immobilization

], modification of an SPR sensor surface with a dextran hydrogel leads to less non-specific adsorption of proteins compared with unmodified surfaces. The presence of such a layer also enhances the immobilization capacity of biomolecules compared with monolayer-based coatings. Due to the flexible nature of the dextran chains, the accessibility also is often improved compared with molecules immobilized on a flat surface. As the amount of protein present in a capillary after immobilization cannot be determined easily, SPR sensors were used as a model to investigate the effect of the different surface modifications on the amount of trypsin that could be attached covalently. Hydroxyl functionalities necessary to enable silanization are introduced using mercaptoethanol (ME), but all other surface modifications are carried out in exactly the same way, both on the SPR sensor surfaces and in the fused-silica capillaries.

The stability during operation of the open-tubular reactor was tested at 37 °C and pH 8.5. Activity tests using the model substrate show that the activity of a reactor that is continuously in operation, is constant for at least two weeks. The enzyme trypsin dissolved in digestion buffer and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C loses 60% of its activity, and after three days no activity is measured.

]. During protein-digestion experiments on SPR sensor surfaces modified identically with the capillary reactors no adsorption during incubation is observed (data not shown). Similarly, during on-line digestion using the dextran coated capillaries, sample adsorption and carry-over are not observed, as repeated sample injections result in identical chromatograms and blank buffer injections do not show peptide fragments. On basis of the latter result and the long lifetime of the reactor, trypsin auto-digestion is probably absent.

However, the latter has not yet been used in an automated set-up and the presence of high amounts of modifier will make reversed-phase chromatography in a subsequent step for the separation of the fragments produced during protein digestion very difficult. The described reactors were efficient in terms of time needed for digestion and the digestion result, but were, as a rule, used for direct infusion into the MS or used for off-line digestion.

], who employed a 10-μL column packed with poroszyme. The sample contained guanidine.HCl for protein denaturation, and was diluted with buffer, also containing methanol, prior to injection. The total time needed for digestion, trapping, and removal of the high concentration of salt was 15 min. The system needed periodic regeneration to counteract the effects of residual salts in the analyte.


Conclusions
To study the immobilization of the protein trypsin in a fused-silica capillary, a number of surface modifications was tested. In order to investigate the amount of protein that can be covalently attached to these surfaces, SPR sensor disks are modified with these coatings to mimic the capillary surface. The SPR measurements show that the best results were obtained using a dextran coating with an intermediate layer. The resulting open-tubular trypsin reactors having a pH optimum of pH 8.5 display a high activity when operated at 37 °C and are stable for at least two weeks when used continuously.

 horse cytochrome C is observed without the need of protein denaturation, reduction, or alkylation when the average residence time of the protein sample in a 140 cm  ×  50 μm capillary IMER is 165 s. For the proteins used in this study trypsin-reactors were described that were capable of faster digestion using denaturing agents like acetonitrile to enhance the digestion process. However, the presence of such agents would seriously hamper direct analysis of the peptides formed using RPLC and MS. Identification of the proteins cytochrome C and myoglobin is possible by the tryptic peptides that are produced on-line, separated by micro-RPLC, and analyzed using mass spectrometry with auto MS–MS.
The open-tubular reactor can be produced easily, reproducibly, and inexpensively, and can be used for other applications such as enzyme-inhibitor studies. Future research will focus on the development of miniaturized multi-dimensional analysis systems employing on-line digestion using these IMERs. The capillary enzyme reactors show no backpressure and seem promising for coupling to other analytical techniques such as capillary electrophoresis and surface plasmon resonance.
