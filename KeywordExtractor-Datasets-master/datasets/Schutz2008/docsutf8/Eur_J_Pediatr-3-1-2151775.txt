Therefore, a one-year surveillance was started again to study the current incidence and the aetiology of late VKDB in the Netherlands. Discussion will rise about the efficacy of the current guideline in order to completely prevent late VKDB.

Methods

].
The paediatricians were asked to report all infants in whom bleeding may have resulted from VKDB. The reported cases were validated with a questionnaire asking for information about the infant, type of feeding, clinical presentation, dose of vitamin K prophylaxis, route of vitamin K prophylaxis, associated diseases and laboratory data. For all reported cases, we asked for an anonymous hospital discharge letter to verify the diagnosis of late-onset VKDB.

Idiopathic cases were defined as cases in whom no factor predisposing to vitamin K deficiency was identified. Secondary cases were those in whom an underlying condition such as cholestasis or other causes of malabsorption of vitamin K could be identified.

The Konakion mixed micellar preparate (Phytomenadion 10 mg/ml, Hoffmann-La Roche, Basel, Switzerland), which can be used for both oral, intramuscular and intravenous administration, an oral preparate called Davitamon K (marketed by Chefaro, Rotterdam, the Netherlands, 25 μg/5gtt) and an oral preparate, Phytomenadion, which is made by the Dutch pharmacist Mixtura (Phytomenadion 10 mg/ml FNA) were the only vitamin K preparations licensed in the Netherlands.

Results
The response rate to the surveillance amounted to 93.4% and the response to our questionnaires was 100%. In total, seven cases of late VKDB were reported: four reports from academic paediatric centres and three from general district hospitals. A hospital discharge letter was obtained in six cases. In all cases, the diagnosis could be verified by the completed questionnaire or the additional discharge letter.
One case did not fulfil the criteria of the case definition because there were no clinical signs of bleeding, only biochemical clotting disorders due to a vitamin K deficiency.

Concerning the cause of VKDB, there was one case of idiopathic VKDB, who presented with signs of bleeding at the age of 5 weeks. She was breastfed and died due to the consequence of an intracranial bleeding. She received exactly the recommended prophylaxis. Unfortunately, no post-mortem obduction was performed but, biochemically, there were no signs of cholestasis. Five out of six cases could be validated as secondary late VKDB. The age of presentation in this group was between 3 and 7 weeks of age. All of these bleedings were due to an underlying cholestasis which was diagnosed after the first presentation of bleeding. In two cases, an intracranial bleeding was the first presenting sign. Four cases were diagnosed as having a bile duct atresia. All infants had been exclusively breastfed and all had received exactly the recommended prophylaxis.
21
]. Therefore, the total incidence of late VKDB and idiopathic late VKDB was calculated to be 3.2 (95% CI: 1.2–6.9) and 0.5 (95% CI: 0–2.9) per 100,000 live births, respectively.

A higher incidence of cholestatic liver diseases in general or a delayed recognition of symptoms can be explanations for this difference. Unfortunately, data about the incidence or recognition of cholestatic liver diseases in the Netherlands are not available.

Secondly, the surveillance lasted only 1 year. In all probability, the confidence interval would be smaller when the length of the surveillance was prolonged. Third, the proportion of infants that is breastfed is unknown, and, additionally, we lack data about compliance to the prophylaxis. It is likely, however, that less than 100% of the eligible cases received the recommended prophylaxis. Prophylaxis failure, therefore, is likely to be underestimated due to a greater denominator than the true numbers exposed.

 as the prophylaxis could give an indication of the efficacy of this dose.
Furthermore, an earlier recognition of symptoms associated with cholestatic liver disease and immediate investigation and treatment of “warning bleeds” helps to prevent the severe consequences of secondary late VKDB.
