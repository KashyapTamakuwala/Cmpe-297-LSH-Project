The timing and appropriateness of surgical treatment of sigmoid diverticular disease remain a topic of controversy. We have reviewed the current literature on this topic, focusing on issues related to the indications and types of surgery. Current evidence would suggest that elective surgery for diverticulitis can be avoided in patients with uncomplicated disease, regardless of the number of recurrent episodes. Furthermore, the need for elective surgey should not be influenced by the age of the patient. Operation should be undertaken in patients with severe attacks, as determined by their clinical and radiological evaluation.

 The significance of these biochemical characteristics still needs to be elucidated, but the differences suggest that there are underlying physiological abnormalities that may predispose to the development and progression of diverticular disease.

Clinical Presentation and Evaluation
The clinical presentations of diverticular disease range from asymptomatic diverticulosis, diverticulosis with periodic spasmodic abdominal pain and bloating, diverticulosis with hemorrhage, and finally, diverticulitis. Although diverticula can occur in any portion of the colon, this review will only focus on sigmoid diverticulitis, by far, the most common site for this disease process.

Management of Complicated Diverticulitis
Surgical intervention is rarely indicated in cases of acute diverticulitis because most of these cases will resolve with appropriate antibiotic management. Operations are reserved for cases of complicated diverticulitis, i.e., patients with perforation and peritonitis, abscess formation, fistula, or obstruction. Although this may seem clear-cut, decisions regarding if and when to operate patients with diverticulitis remain a topic of significant debate.

 The Hartmann’s resection has proven to be a safe and effective approach, and is based upon the idea that an anastomosis in the setting of acute infection/inflammation is dangerous and associated with a high rate of suture line breakdown.

 looked at 277 consecutive patients treated for acute diverticular disease at the University of Minnesota, both urgently and electively. Of these, 88% had a primary anastomosis, most of them without diversion. They found that primary anastomosis was quite safe, with an overall 4% leak rate. Interestingly, none of these leaks were in their subset of patients with Hinchey stage IV diverticulitis, a group that comprised 9% of their total study population.
16
 These data suggest that in a select group of patients undergoing surgery in the acute stage of diverticulitis, an anastomosis is probably safe, even in the milieu of feculent peritonitis.

Mention should be made of the meticulous surgical technique that must be used in this situation. The splenic flexure of the colon may need to be mobilized to ensure a tension-free anastomosis. One should imagine the rectum collapsing back into the pelvis with the patient standing upright when deciding on whether the bowel ends are truly free of tension. The margins of resection must be clearly viable with regard to vascularity. Finally, it may be best to avoid the crossed staple lines inherent to the double-stapled technique. Either a double pursestring technique with a stapled end-to-end anastomosis or a standard handsewn anastomosis are preferred when operating in an inflamed milieu.

 reviewed 108 patients admitted with complicated diverticulitis. Almost all of them (104) required emergency surgery. Interestingly, only 26% of these patients were previously diagnosed with diverticular disease and only three patients had been admitted in the past with a prior episode of acute diverticulitis. In other words, only 2.7% of patients in this group would have benefited from an elective resection. Complications would still have occurred in 92.6% of patients in whom these attacks happened de novo.
Thus, it appears that elective resection might have little impact on the incidence of patients requiring emergency procedures because most of these occur with the first attack of diverticulitis. Subsequent attacks of diverticulitis in the same patient seem to be akin to their previous ones, suggesting that specific patients are predisposed to a set pattern of diverticulitis, and once settled into this pattern they stay within it. The threat of the colostomy bag to a patient who has been successfully managed medically during two previous attacks may be unwarranted and misleading.

In addition, elective surgery may be justified in patients with limited access to medical care or in those who are concerned about the negative impact of repeated illnesses with regard to work productivity and/or psychosocial issues.

 were among the first to challenge the concept that diverticulitis in the young is a more virulent disease. These authors surveyed 40 patients under the age of 50 that where treated with intravenous antibiotics and bowel rest and found that at a 5- to 9-year follow-up, none of these patients required colostomies. One third of them did undergo surgery, but most of these procedures where either elective or, if urgent, still conducive to a successful primary anastomosis.

Based upon these studies, we believe that young patients should generally be treated using the same criteria as older patients, and that the there is no justification for the routine recommendation for surgery after a single attack of diverticulitis in young patients. Elective preemptive surgery should be reserved for those who had at least two episodes of severe diverticulitis, and this decision should be supported by CT scan documentation of prior complicated disease.

 It is not clear, however, whether the data from this small study of 121 patients are applicable to all surgeons in all centers.

Conclusion
The management of patients with sigmoid diverticulitis is still evolving. We should continue to constantly reassess the surgical dogma regarding the appropriate treatment of this common disease entity. Clearly, a randomized controlled study comparing the Hartmann’s procedure to primary anastomosis in the setting of perforated diverticulitis would be worthwhile. It is becoming increasingly clear that mandatory operations may not be warranted in young patients or those with two episodes of diverticulitis. As in other areas of clinical surgery, we must tailor our treatment to the specific situation for each individual patient.
