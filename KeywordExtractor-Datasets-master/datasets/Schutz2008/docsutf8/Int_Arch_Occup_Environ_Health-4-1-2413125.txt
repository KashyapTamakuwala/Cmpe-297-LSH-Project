Objectives
The purpose of this article is to explore the associations of psychosocial factors at work, life style, and stressful life events on health and work ability among white-collar workers.

Methods
n
 = 1141). The main outcome variables were work ability, measured by the work ability index (WAI), and mental and physical health, measured by the Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12). Individual characteristics, psychosocial factors at work, stressful life events, and lifestyle factors were determined by a questionnaire. Maximum oxygen uptake, weight, height, and biceps strength were measured during a physical examination.

Results
Work ability of white-collar workers in commercial services industry was strongly associated with psychosocial factors at work such as teamwork, stress handling, and self-development and, to a lesser extent, with stressful life events, lack of physical activity, and obesity. Determinants of mental health were very similar to those of work ability, whereas physical health was influenced primarily by life style factors. With respect to work ability, the influence of unhealthy life style seems more important for older workers, than for their younger colleagues.

Conclusion
Among white-collar workers mental and physical health were of equal importance to work ability, but only mental health and work ability shared the same determinants. The strong associations between psychosocial factors at work and mental health and work ability suggest that in this study population health promotion should address working conditions rather than individual life style factors.

Introduction

). This calls for better adjustments of the working life demands with the individual’s health as a crucial element for a longer career at work. Within this framework, the concept of work ability has been developed as an important tool to identify workers at risk for imbalance between health, capabilities and demands at work.

). However, the knowledge of determinants of work ability in mentally demanding occupations is scarce and hence, it remains unclear whether in these jobs the relative importance of personal and work-related factors is similar to their well-known contribution in physically demanding jobs.
The purpose of this study was to explore the associations of psychosocial factors at work, stressful life events, and life style on health and work ability among white-collar workers.

Methods
Subjects

n
 = 1808). Selection of subjects with both a filled out questionnaire and a physical examination comprised the study population of 1141 (42.8%) subjects.

Functional health status

). The mental health summary score ranges from 8 to 74, whereas the physical health summary score ranges from 4 to 73, with a higher score indicating a better health state.

Psychosocial factors at work
2001
). The original monitor consists of four dimensions, whereas three dimensions (teamwork, stress handling, and self-development) were used in the current study. The three dimensions consist of 27 items on a five-point scale varying from “totally disagree” to “totally agree”. The dimension teamwork (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.85) reflects social support and work spirit and consists of 12 items, e.g. “I can rely on my colleagues and trust them” and “We are not a team at work”. The stress-handling dimension (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.77) reflects active coping and self-efficacy and consists of seven items, such as “In difficult situations I do not wait and see, but take action” and “I can cope well with the demands of my job”. The dimension self-development (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.82) reflects possibilities for self-fulfilment and consists of eight items. Examples are: “My abilities are full employed” and “I need a new challenge”. The scores on items within each dimension were transformed to a 0–100 scale with a higher score indicating good teamwork, better stress handling, and more opportunities for self-development in work. The sum scores for the variables teamwork, stress handling, and self-development were not normally distributed. Tertiles were calculated to assign subjects into low, intermediate and high levels per dimension.

Stressful life events
1967
). The original SRRQ consists of 43 life events (e.g., divorce, job change, death of family members and so forth), listed by rank order based on their mean life change values. Life change values classify the impact of the events and were obtained by scaling the life events based on the amount of coping required to deal with the event. The total score counts the life change values of all events in the past 12 months. In the current study the 25 events most appropriate for the population under study were selected. In theory, the total score can range from none of these events (0) up to all events (1077).

 max, and biceps strength), the assumption of linearity was not violated. These variables were included in the linear regression analyses as continuous variables. Due to considerable ceiling effects for the psychosocial variables and skewed distribution for life stress events, these variables were treated as categorical variables, defined by cut-off values based on tertiles.
P
-value of 0.05 or less were retained in the final model.
The results of the regression analyses are presented by the regression coefficients and associated standard errors. A regression coefficient is an expression of the change in the work ability score due to a change in one unit of measurement of the independent variable of interest. For categorical variables, this reflects the effect on the work ability score of the presence of this determinant.
The regression analysis on determinants of work ability was stratified for three age groups. All significant determinants in the multivariate model for one age group were included in the models for other age groups as well in order to provide an appropriate comparison.

Discussion
This study showed that work ability of white-collar workers in commercial services industry was strongly associated with psychosocial factors at work, such as teamwork, stress handling, self-development, and, to a lesser extent, with stressful life events, lack of physical activity, and obesity. Work ability was strongly associated with mental and physical health. Determinants of mental health were very similar to those of work ability, whereas physical health was influenced primarily by lack of life physical activity.
Some limitations must be taken into account in this study. First, the cross-sectional design does not permit exploration of causal relationships between the determinants and work ability. Therefore, it remains unknown whether, for example, poor stress handling will decrease work ability or decreased work ability will cause a poorer stress handling. Nevertheless, the results are still of interest as they give a first insight into important factors for interventions among white-collar workers. Second, data were drawn from voluntary participants. Information on non-response for both measures showed that age and sex did not bias response. Non-response differences between questionnaire and physical examination did not show any bias; none of the questionnaire variables were associated with not participating in the physical examination; and also none of the physical examination variables were associated with not participating in the questionnaire. Third, the reliability of the physical examination highly depends on the professional skills of the instructor and the standardization of the examination. The maximum oxygen uptake was indirectly calculated using the heart rate, which can be easily increased by minor distractions, such as room temperature, and talking during the test.
1998
).
Work ability in this study population was influenced by sex, age, psychosocial factors at work, stressful life events, and life style factors. These factors together explained 29% of the total variance in work ability in this study population. Male sex increased work ability with two points, which means 4% of the maximum score. An increase in age of 40 years decreases the WAI score with four points, which is 7.3% of the maximum score, which indicates a rather modest influence of age on work ability. Psychosocial factors each had an effect on WAI comparable to sex, whereas the combined effect of the psychosocial factors is approximately 1.5-fold the effect of 40 years of aging. Lack of vigorous physical activity decreases the WAI score with only 0.7 points, which is no more than 1.5% of the maximum score. Obesity (5% of the population) compared to normal weight decreases the WAI score with 1.2 points, which is 2.4% of the maximum score.
Each psychosocial factor at work was negatively associated with work ability. Univariate results showed comparable strength in associations, while the multivariate model showed lower regression coefficients, especially for teamwork. It seems that the association between teamwork and work ability was more influenced by other determinants included in the multivariate model, than the associations between work ability and stress handling and self-development.

). It may be hypothesized that in mentally demanding jobs a good physical condition is not required to meet the work demands and, thus, will have no influence on work ability.
Stratification by age showed the importance of lifestyle in the oldest age group, but not among younger workers. This effect may be explained by the fact that health problems due to an unhealthy lifestyle, most notably diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease, occur primarily at older age. In the total study population, obesity was significantly associated with lower work ability, whereas no significant associations were found in the stratified analyses. This is partly due to lack of statistical power in these strata with smaller numbers of workers, since the magnitude of the regression coefficients were comparable but the standard errors increased substantially.
2004
). In a univariate analysis both mental health and physical health were associated with work ability. However, determinants of work ability were similar to determinants of mental health. This finding can be explained by the fact that the work setting of the white-collar workers in the current study is characterized by high mental demands. An exception to the similarity in factors influencing both mental health and work ability was, smoking. Smoking was related to mental health, but not to work ability.
The results of the current study outline the importance of work-related factors in white-collar workers, with regard to work ability. The combined impact of psychosocial factors is much stronger than is for individual factors, and is amenable to change, in contrast to individual factors as age, and sex.
In conclusion, among white-collar workers in commercial services industry psychosocial factors at work, stressful life events, lack of vigorous physical activity, and obesity were significant with regard to work ability. The strong associations between psychosocial factors at work and mental health and work ability suggest that in this study population health promotion should address working conditions rather than individual life style factors, although the importance of life style factors seems to increase with aging of the worker.
