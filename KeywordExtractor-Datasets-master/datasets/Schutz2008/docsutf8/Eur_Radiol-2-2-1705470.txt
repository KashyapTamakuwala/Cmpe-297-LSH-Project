Our aim was to conduct a prospective study to evaluate staging accuracy of a new coil concept for endoluminal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on ex vivo gastric carcinomas. Twenty-eight consecutive patients referred to surgery with a clinically proven primary gastric malignancy were included. Surgical specimens were examined with a foldable and self-expanding loop coil (8-cm diameter) at 1.5 Tesla immediately after total gastrectomy. T1- and T2-weighted and opposed-phase sequences (axial, frontal sections; 3- to 4-mm slice thickness) were acquired. Investigators blinded to any patient information analyzed signal intensity of normal gastric wall, gastric tumor, and lymph nodes. Findings were compared with histopathological staging. On surgical specimens, 2–5 gastric wall layers could be visualized. All gastric tumors (26 carcinomas, two lymphomas) were identified on endoluminal MR data (100%). Overall accuracy for T staging was 75% (18/24); sensitivity to detect serosal involvement was 80% and specificity 89%. N staging correlated in 58% (14/24) with histopathology (N+ versus N−). The endoluminal coil concept is feasible and applicable for an ex vivo setting. Endoluminal MR data provided sufficient detail for gastric wall layer differentiation, and therefore, identification of T stages in gastric carcinoma is possible. Further investigations in in vivo settings should explore the potential of our coil concept for endoluminal MR imaging.

]. Its purpose is to eliminate or delay systemic metastasis and reduce micrometastatic spread of disease. Another benefit is potential reduction of tumor volume in initially unresectable advanced tumor stages (downstaging), therefore increasing resectability rate. An adequate treatment strategy, especially in regard to the concept of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, requires precise clinical staging to depict relevant prognostic factors and identify resectable tumor stages. This also accounts for endoscopically treated early gastric cancers as well as for adenocarcinomas of the gastroesophageal (GE) junction since each type of tumor requires a different surgical approach. Thus, the exact knowledge of tumor morphology and tumor invasion into gastric wall is a crucial information for clinical staging.

]. A major problem with endoluminal RF coils is placement close to the region of interest and depth of visualization. Our approach uses a foldable and afterward self-expanding loop coil design (8-cm diameter), which enhances spatial resolution and depth of visualization The aim of our study was to assess normal gastric wall architecture and signal intensity (SI) on endoluminal MRI as well as signal intensity and appearance of gastric carcinomas and their related lymph nodes. Subsequently, we used endoluminal MRI as staging modality on ex vivo gastric carcinomas. Findings were compared with histopathological staging.

T1: tumor invasion of the lamina propria of mucosa or invasion of submucosa, wall thickening, and signal intensity changes confined to these layers.

T2: tumor invasion extended to the muscularis propria, and additional thickening through gastric layers with signal intensity changes showing either a homogeneous or inhomogeneous lesion without serosal abnormalities. If invasion extended beyond muscularis propria into an adjacent fat tissue plane without serosal infiltration, it was considered as T2.

T3: tumor invasion of mucosa, submucosa, and muscularis propria, with infiltration of the serosa or changes in signal intensity presenting with micronodular strands as growth into extraserosal fat tissue.

T4: tumor invasion into adjacent organs or structures clearly presenting as contiguous tumor extension or a mass with similar signal intensity as the gastric tumor.



N staging was done counting the lymph nodes detectable on MRI, regarding them as pathologic due to their signal intensity. Since gastrectomy samples varied in lymph node content due to surgical technique and extension of the gastrectomy not comparable to an in vivo situation, N factor was graded into N+ for positive findings of lymph nodes and into N− for absence of lymph nodes. In each case, normal gastric wall features were assessed. Signal intensities of the mucosa, submucosa, muscularis propria, and serosa or subserosa were recorded, as well as the amount of layers in which the normal gastric wall could be differentiated into. A score system from 1 to 5 (1=poor; 5=very good) was used for several study items to weigh the power of their findings. Each sequence, for example, was rated for image quality on a range from 1 to 5, representing insufficient to very good. Signal intensity and morphology of the gastric tumors and demarcation to normal gastric wall were used to describe characteristics of tumor presentation. The lesion was identified by irregular architecture of gastric wall, abnormal thickening, and change in signal intensity of gastric wall layers, which usually present with sharp and clear demarcation into three to five different layers with distinct signal intensities and thickness. Tumor size was not measured, as it does not influence T staging or provide further information. Histopathology was considered the gold standard, and radiological data where compared with its results.
All data are presented as absolute numbers and relatively as percentages. Concordance of histopathological results and radiological findings are reported as overall accuracy. Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for T factor, N+/− factor are provided. Detection rate of serous membrane invasion or the differentiation between T2 and T3 stages was assessed, as it defines advanced stages of disease. Ninety-five percent confidence intervals (CI) are given if statistically applicable.

]. Two cases were not included because of insufficient image quality. Histopathology found 26 carcinomas (15 adenocarcinomas, nine signet cell carcinomas, two mixed type carcinomas) and two gastric lymphomas. Four tumors were classified as pT1, 15 as pT2, 3 as pT3, and 2 as pT4. Gastric lymphomas were excluded from the study although they where detected as such in both cases (100%).

Nodal involvement
Lymph node detection resulted in N+ for detected lymph nodes in 17 cases with N− in 7 cases. Sensitivity for detecting N+ was 71%±18.22, specificity 29%±18.07, and accuracy 58%±19.72. This reflects the limitation of the study design. Ex vivo gastrectomy specimens do not provide the same quantity of lymph nodes as pathological workup. The mean score rating N factor staging was 4.4 (range 2–5).

]. The small cylindrical RF coil design implemented in the tip of the MR endoscope may be a reason for problems in obtaining sufficient images in the stomach. Our approach using an insertable and self-expandable RF coil (8-cm diameter), independent from the MR endoscope, seems to be more suitable for imaging of the stomach by providing enhanced depth of visualization. In 93%, sufficient image data was obtained. Detection of resectable lesions can only be accomplished by exact knowledge of tumor invasion in relation to gastric wall layers. New multimodal treatment strategies require the information of tumor stage, as it defines enrollment into neoadjuvant therapy approach. Clinical staging based on imaging studies can provide important information for adequate therapy decision if they fulfill this requirement. Gastric wall differentiation and identification is essential for accurate staging of gastric malignancies.

]. It is not certain whether tumor invasion into or close to the serosa or subserosa layer changes its signal intensity presentation. Indirect detection by subserosal fat tissue seems possible, but in our experience, there is some variance in the thickness of subserosal fat tissue in gastric carcinoma specimens. One reason for this could be tumor cachexia.
An interesting learning point is reflected by the results of T staging. Knowledge of the gastric region where the tumor is located is important since T staging of the stomach depends on the gastric region. Tumors of the cardia and part of the fundus region where a serosal layer is missing are considered T2 whereas they would be T3 in other gastric regions. The study setup was intended to be as close as possible to a future in vivo setting with an MR endoscope, but tumor location and gastric region cannot be read on image data from gastrectomy specimens. An in vivo setting would enable investigators to acquire this information. After providing the tumors' gastric region, T staging accuracy improved to 75%. Thus, the gastric region of tumor location is an important fact for adequate staging of tumor invasion. While this study used an ex vivo model of gastric carcinomas and the amount of patients included could be higher, the entire range of T factors for gastric carcinomas is covered. Another limitation of this study is the missing congruence of lymph nodes present in the gastrectomy specimens due to surgical technique to those available for histopathology. This is reflected by N-factor staging results. An in vivo setting should be more accurate but poses new problems, such as motion artefacts due to patient or endoscope movement. Modern rapid MRI sequences and spasmolytic agents may be able to overcome these obstacles in an in vivo setting, but this is a goal for future studies. It is important to point out pitfalls of this imaging technique, as overstaging is a problem in many imaging modalities. Peritumor inflammation, micronodular affection of the serosal membrane, and diffuse-type gastric carcinoma were retrospectively identified as reasons for misinterpretation of tumor invasion. Overstaging occurred in 17%, with three T1 tumors not correctly classified. This is encouraging since all T1 tumors were detected as tumors but in two cases were classified as T2 tumors and one as T3. Only one incorrectly classified T2 tumor contributed to overstaging. This indicates that overstaging was not a problem of differentiation between T2 and T3 stages of disease.

In this study, we have shown that our concept is functional and feasible for MRI of the stomach, and staging results comparable with other imaging modalities were achieved. Endoluminal MRI in combination with conventional MRI could assess local and regional imaging in one session, giving accurate information about local staging and metastatic spread of disease. Secondary contrast media should be evaluated for its use in improving gastric wall layer discrimination and identification as well as tumor demarcation. Additional studies are needed to assess the clinical feasibility of this coil concept in vivo for imaging of the upper gastrointestinal tract. High-resolution imaging of the pancreas could be another possible application. Today, most tumors of the stomach and esophagus are staged by conventional methods, such as endoscopy, EUS, or CT. Future prospects of endoscopic MRI may be limited to certain tumor entities, such as early or advanced carcinomas, but it could be able to answer additional specific clinical questions for relevant therapy decisions.
Summary
 Endoluminal MRI with the coil concept is feasible and applicable. T staging of ex vivo gastric carcinomas is possible. Results for T-factor staging are preliminary but promising, as they reflect the first experience with this technique. Image quality and resolution obtained with the endoluminal RF coil are convincing for future use in gastrointestinal imaging. Limitations of this study include missing congruence in quantity of lymph nodes for N staging, a limited amount of some T-stage gastric carcinomas, and the ex vivo setting. Taking the limitations into account, the coil design should be investigated in an in vivo setting after assessing safety aspects to evaluate the prospects given by the ex vivo results. The clinical potential may be limited by providing a staging tool for certain tumor entities. With more experience in endoluminal MRI and interpretation of endoluminal image data, its use could be extended toward other fields in gastrointestinal imaging.
