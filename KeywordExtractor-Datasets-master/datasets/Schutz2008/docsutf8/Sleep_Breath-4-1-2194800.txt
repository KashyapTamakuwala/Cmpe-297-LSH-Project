 < 0.01). The most common adverse events were headache, nausea, and insomnia. Armodafinil did not adversely affect desired nighttime sleep, and nCPAP use remained high (approximately 7 h/night). Adjunct treatment with armodafinil significantly improved wakefulness, long-term memory, and patients’ ability to engage in activities of daily living in nCPAP-adherent individuals with ES associated with OSA. Armodafinil also reduced patient-reported fatigue and was well tolerated.

]. All patients were receiving stable (greater than or equal to 4 weeks) and effective nCPAP therapy on a regular basis (greater than or equal to 4 h per night on greater than or equal to 70% of nights) during the 2-week evaluation period. The CPAP use was monitored using the REMstar Auto CPAP System. Effectiveness of therapy was determined by an apnea–hypopnea index (AHI) less than or equal to ten events per hour on nighttime polysomnography (PSG).

] or by a positive result from the urine drug screen given at screening and again at the final visit, caffeine consumption greater than 600 mg/day, or a clinically significant sensitivity to central nervous system stimulants or modafinil. Women who were pregnant or breast feeding were also excluded. The use of any substance that could affect wakefulness or sleepiness (e.g., modafinil, sodium oxybate, melatonin, lithium, St. John’s wort, methylphenidate, amphetamines, pemoline, antipsychotic agents, benzodiazepines, zolpidem, anticonvulsants, or barbiturates), use of other excluded agents (e.g., monoamine oxidase inhibitors, anticoagulants), use of clinically significant amounts of nonprescription drugs within 7 days of screening, and use of investigational drugs within 1 month of screening was prohibited. All patients provided written informed consent before participation in these studies and were compensated for their participation.

]. Sleep latencies were averaged across the first four tests (09:00, 11:00, 13:00, 15:00) and the last three tests (15:00, 17:00, 19:00) to distinguish between early- and late-day effects, respectively. The proportion of patients with at least a minimal improvement on the CGI-C was assessed to determine patients’ overall clinical improvement in the individual studies; however, these data were not poolable for this analysis because of a substantial difference in the percentage of responders to placebo between the two studies.

] was administered by computer as six separate 25-min sessions conducted at 09:30, 11:30, 13:30, 15:30, 17:30, and 19:30. The CDR battery includes five memory tests (immediate word recall, delayed word recall, numeric working memory, word recognition, and picture recognition) and three attention tests (simple reaction time, choice reaction time, and digit vigilance). Two composite factors are derived from the memory tests in the CDR: quality of episodic secondary memory, a measure of long-term memory that measures the ability to recall verbal and visual information, and speed of memory, which assesses the time it takes to decide whether information is held in memory. Two composite factors are derived from the CDR for attention: power of attention, which measures the ability to focus attention and avoid distraction (concentration), and continuity of attention, which measures the ability to sustain attention (vigilance). Similar to the MWT, the CDR scores were averaged across the first four test sessions (09:30, 11:30, 13:30, 15:30) and the last three test sessions (15:30, 17:30, 19:30) to assess cognitive effects on early- and late-day measurements.

] and were based on changes in global fatigue (average of all nine questions) and worst fatigue in the past 24 h (item 3). The rating scale for the BFI ranges from 0 (no fatigue) to 10 (as bad as you can imagine). A score of greater than or equal to 7 for either global fatigue or worst fatigue in the past 24 h is indicative of severe fatigue. Both the ESS and BFI were administered before the first MWT session (09:00) at each visit.

Safety and tolerability assessments
Adverse events were monitored and recorded by the study investigators at each center throughout both studies. Clinical laboratory tests (blood chemistry, hematology, urinalysis), vital signs (resting heart rate and systolic and diastolic blood pressure 3 and 13 h postadministration), and electrocardiograms were obtained at screening, baseline, and weeks 4, 8, and 12. Physical examinations were performed at baseline and week 12. Patients’ use of nCPAP was monitored at least 2 weeks before baseline and throughout both studies using the Respironics REMstar Auto CPAP system. Effect on nighttime sleep was determined by PSG, which was performed the night immediately after the measurement of daytime MWT during the second screening visit and the final visit. The PSG was conducted for 8 h, starting within 30 min of the patient’s usual bedtime but not earlier than 21:30.
Clinically significant elevations in resting systolic and diastolic blood pressure were defined a priori as greater than or equal to 140 mmHg with an increase of greater than or equal to 10% and greater than or equal to 90 mmHg with an increase of greater than or equal to 10%, respectively. Patients with worsening hypertension included those who had a history of hypertension at baseline and who started new antihypertensive medication and/or increased the dose of previously used antihypertensive medication during the studies. Patients with newly diagnosed hypertension included those who had no history of hypertension at baseline and who started antihypertensive medication during the studies. Patients at risk for hypertension included those who had at least two clinically significant elevations in blood pressure readings between baseline and final visit.


Statistical analysis
Descriptive statistics were used to summarize continuous and categorical demographic variables. Efficacy assessments were analyzed at weeks 4, 8, and 12 using observed cases and at final visit (week 12 or last postbaseline measurement) using the last observation carried forward approach. Efficacy analyses included randomized patients who received at least one dose of study drug and had a baseline measurement with at least one postbaseline measurement on the MWT and CGI-C. Safety and tolerability analyses included all randomized patients who received at least one dose of study drug. All efficacy assessments were analyzed by analysis of variance (ANOVA) with treatment and study as factors. Tests of poolability for all continuous efficacy variables across the two studies were conducted using an ANOVA with treatment and study and treatment by study interaction as factors. Vital signs and data from nighttime PSG were analyzed by Wilcoxon rank-sum test. For nCPAP use, the change from baseline to on-treatment values was analyzed using one-way ANOVA. All statistical tests were two-tailed, and the 5% level of significance was used.

There were no clinically significant changes from baseline to final visit in either the armodafinil group or the placebo group for laboratory values, electrocardiogram parameters, or physical examinations. There were also no meaningful changes (clinical or statistical) from baseline to final visit for systolic blood pressure (0.2 [14.2] mmHg for armodafinil vs −1.0 [14.6] mmHg for placebo), diastolic blood pressure (0.3 [9.3] mmHg for armodafinil vs −1.0 [10.0] mmHg for placebo), and heart rate (2.3 [9.6] bpm for armodafinil vs 1.4 [9.6] bpm for placebo).
The incidence of patients with newly diagnosed hypertension was less than 1% in the armodafinil group and less than 1% in the placebo group. The proportion of patients at risk for hypertension was similar for both treatment groups (18% of 391 patients, armodafinil group; 16% of 260 patients, placebo group). The incidence of patients with worsening hypertension was 3% of 391 patients in the armodafinil group and 2% of 260 patients in the placebo group.

], the pooled analysis showed that adjunct armodafinil significantly improves long-term memory (i.e., quality of episodic secondary memory) at all study visits compared with placebo, indicating that treatment was associated with a greater ability to recall verbal and visual information. Interestingly, the long-term memory benefit occurred independent of a consistent benefit on attention and concentration. It is important to note that the CDR composite factors in both of the individual armodafinil OSA studies were secondary efficacy variables. Thus, although results from the pooled analysis provide a more precise estimate of the effects on long-term memory, further studies are needed to determine the potential role of armodafinil in improving cognitive function in nCPAP-adherent patients with OSA and associated ES.
Armodafinil significantly improved patients’ ability to engage in activities of daily living at all visits as measured by the ESS. The patient population studied in this pooled analysis had severe ES (mean ESS score greater than 15) despite effective and regular nCPAP therapy. At the final visit, 49 and 26% of patients receiving armodafinil and placebo, respectively, had ESS scores less than 10, indicating that nearly half of patients no longer had pathological sleepiness with adjunct armodafinil treatment.

]. Armodafinil was well tolerated; in general, adverse events were rated as mild to moderate in nature, although some patients discontinued because of adverse events. There were some minor changes in vital signs; however, these effects were not considered to be clinically significant. The patient population selected for both studies was verified to be adherent to nCPAP therapy; thus, the primary pathology of OSA was being treated in an appropriate and effective manner throughout the course of the two studies. At the final visit, the duration of nCPAP use had decreased minimally from baseline compared with placebo. Average nCPAP use remained high (approximately 7 h/night) and was effective (i.e., low AHI values). Adjunct armodafinil treatment did not affect arousals.
Findings from the present pooled analysis are limited to patients with OSA who have residual ES despite regular and effective nCPAP therapy and should not be generalized to patients with OSA who are not receiving adequate nCPAP therapy or are not using it regularly. Additionally, the 12-week duration of treatment in these studies limits the applicability of observed results to a longer period of treatment. It should be recognized that armodafinil does not treat the underlying airway obstruction and should not be considered a replacement for nCPAP therapy in patients with OSA. Further research is needed to determine the role armodafinil may have in improving cognitive function and whether the significant reduction in fatigue observed in the pooled analysis will contribute toward improved quality of life in this patient population.
In conclusion, pooled data from two 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies showed that once-daily administration of armodafinil significantly improved wakefulness when used as adjunct therapy in nCPAP-adherent patients with residual ES associated with OSA. The effect on wakefulness with armodafinil was maintained throughout the day. Importantly, adjunctive treatment with armodafinil was associated with significant improvements in long-term memory and patients’ ability to engage in daily activities. Armodafinil significantly reduced fatigue in the studied population and was well tolerated.
