 Whether microvascular invasion (microVI), defined as microscopic tumor invasion in smaller intrahepatic vessels identified on pathologic analysis, or macroVI should also be considered a contraindication to LT is controversial. Both types of tumor invasion are difficult to determine pre-LT; therefore, their significance remains uncertain.

 The purpose of this study was to determine if microVI, macroVI, and other pathological factors are associated with tumor recurrence after LT and examine the outcomes thereafter. If these factors are predictors of poor tumor-free survival, then how can we attempt to identify these variables before transplant?

. Tumor size was measured as the largest diameter of the major tumor in centimeters. MacroVI was defined as gross vascular invasion into major portal vessels or hepatic veins identified either intraoperatively or on pathologic explant, whereas microVI was determined on pathologic analysis as microscopic vascular invasion of small vessels within the parenchyma of the liver. Pretransplant therapy was used in selective cases; if waiting time was determined to be longer than 6 months, patients commonly underwent radio frequency ablation as a bridge to LT. This was performed in an attempt to keep patients within Milan criteria while on the LT waiting list. Postoperative immunosuppression was similar in all patients and consisted of cyclosporine or tacrolimus and steroids.
After LT, patients were followed with Q3 monthly alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and CT along with standard post-LT evaluation. Recurrences were defined as new nodules diagnosed by CT with confirmed biopsy in most cases. Overall survival (OS) was death as a result of any cause after LT. Patients were followed until death or study closure (arbitrarily denoted as October 1, 2004). Data was collected until May 1, 2005 to ensure at least 6 months of follow-up for all patients.

Specifically, if microVI or macroVI was present on histopathology, 64 and 100% of the tumors, respectively, were outside of the Milan criteria or were TNM stage III or IV. Histological grade was not associated with either type of vascular invasion; 85% of patients with either type of vascular invasion had favorably differentiated tumors. Ablation did not affect the rate of vascular invasion, either microVI or macroVI, in this series. Eleven of 33 patients (33%) with vascular invasion on explant analysis had undergone ablation of their tumor.

 but in this study, a significant difference was found in DFS. Our studies suggest that large tumor size (>4 cm) and multiple tumors (≥3) correlate with an increased incidence of vascular invasion and may provide a surrogate marker for entities that are often difficult to detect before LT.

 found that macroVI, but not microVI, was a significant predictor of DSF and OS after LT for HCC. In this study, microVI is associated with higher stage and recurrent tumors, but does not appear to be an independent factor for survival.

 reported that tumor size greater than 4 cm and poorly differentiated/undifferentiated histopathologic grade increased the odds of microVI by 3 and 6.3-fold, respectively, but these tumors were primarily in Child class A cirrhotic.

 Lack of manipulation of the liver and intrahepatic dissection may be a potential explanation for the lack of importance of microVI with LT.

 In our experience, needle biopsy was a poor predictor of microVI or macroVI, and therefore was not considered in our pre-LT work-up for HCC (data not shown).
There are several limitations to this study and therefore some of the results should be interpreted with caution. The need to standardize grading systems for HCC has long been recognized and would allow us to determine if tumor grade is indeed an important prognostic marker for recurrence and survival. Few tumors in this study were graded as poorly differentiated; moreover, in 27 patients, their grade was not determined. Results from histopathological analysis are often met with inherent biases from the pathologist and comprehensive evaluation of the whole liver explant may vary among pathologists and institutions. Finally, with very few tumors containing macroVI, strong conclusions about prognostic characteristics concerning macroVI cannot be made in this report. Whether microVI is a harbinger of macroVI or in some way correlated with a more aggressive form of HCC remains unclear.

 Because of small numbers, this would be best done in a multicenter-randomized trial. We are currently evaluating the role of tumor size and number in our allocation system in LT for HCC to determine their respective predictive value for prognosis.
In summary, LT for HCC can be performed with acceptable survival outcomes. A single tumor characteristic alone does not appear to determine prognosis or outcome. In the present study, macroVI alone was associated with very poor outcomes after LT. Extending criteria of LT for advanced HCC is possible only with better patient selection using improved pre-LT staging and identification of histopathological biological markers such as macroVI that would preclude LT.
