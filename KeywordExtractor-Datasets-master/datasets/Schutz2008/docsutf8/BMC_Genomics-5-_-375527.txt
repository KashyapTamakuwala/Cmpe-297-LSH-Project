Background
cis
-elements on DNA sequences. To identify functional regulatory elements, computer searching can predict TF binding sites (TFBS) using position weight matrices (PWMs) that represent positional base frequencies of collected experimentally determined TFBS. A disadvantage of this approach is the large output of results for genomic DNA. One strategy to identify genuine TFBS is to utilize local concentrations of predicted TFBS. It is unclear whether there is a general tendency for TFBS to cluster at promoter regions, although this is the case for certain TFBS. Also unclear is the identification of TFs that have TFBS concentrated in promoters and to what level this occurs. This study hopes to answer some of these questions.

Results
We developed the cluster score measure to evaluate the correlation between predicted TFBS clusters and promoter sequences for each PWM. Non-promoter sequences were used as a control. Using the cluster score, we identified a PWM group called PWM-PCP, in which TFBS clusters positively correlate with promoters, and another PWM group called PWM-NCP, in which TFBS clusters negatively correlate with promoters. The PWM-PCP group comprises 47% of the 199 vertebrate PWMs, while the PWM-NCP group occupied 11 percent. After reducing the effect of CpG islands (CGI) against the clusters using partial correlation coefficients among three properties (promoter, CGI and predicted TFBS cluster), we identified two PWM groups including those strongly correlated with CGI and those not correlated with CGI.

Conclusion
Not all PWMs predict TFBS correlated with human promoter sequences. Two main PWM groups were identified: (1) those that show TFBS clustered in promoters associated with CGI, and (2) those that show TFBS clustered in promoters independent of CGI. Assessment of PWM matches will allow more positive interpretation of TFBS in regulatory regions.

Background
Understanding the regulation of gene expression is a crucial issue in molecular biology. Since gene expression is mainly regulated by transcription factors (TFs), the elucidation of relationships among TFs, their binding sites (TFBS) and their controlling genes, is of great importance.

]. These studies assume the use of appropriate PWMs to identify clustered TFBS. To determine if a particular cluster is genuinely related to the promoter, it is important to assess clusters of predicted TFBS for each individual PWM. This is done using real non-promoter sequences for the appropriate selection of the PWM and for the interpretation of clusters of predicted TFBS. Most of these studies use specific sets of coregulated genes to identify common predicted TFBS clusters, and therefore cannot be applied directly to the study of general properties of promoters.
In this study, we developed a measure that evaluates the degree of concentration of predicted TFBS to clarify whether predicted TFBS have a tendency to cluster in human promoter sequences rather than in non-promoter sequences for each PWM. We identified some PWMs in which predicted TFBS clusters occur more significantly in promoter than non-promoter sequences and vice versa. Using partial correlations among three properties (promoters, CGI and clusters of predicted TFBS), we identified two PWM groups, (1) those in which TFBS cluster in promoters as a result of the presence of CpG islands, and (2) those in which TFBS cluster in promoters independent of CpG islands. We show that transcription factors corresponding to the latter PWM group tend to be tissue-specific. In summary, this analysis is useful for the interpretation of predicted TFBS in regulatory regions.

]. To determine if this is a general tendency for PWM matches and all protein coding genes, we have developed a measure that evaluates the correlation between predicted TFBS concentrations and promoter sequences. We then examined the correlation for individual PWMs using an unbiased sequence set. Our results show that not all TFBS are clustered in promoter sequences. We found that TFBS clusters corresponding to 47% of PWMs are positively correlated with promoter sequences, and that TFBS clusters corresponding to around 11% of PWMs are negatively correlated with promoter sequences.

] then genes without CGI can be assumed to be tissue-specific or rarely expressed. Thus, genes with a cluster of predicted TFBS not associated with CGI might be associated with tissue-specific regulation. Further analysis of extractions of tissue specific genes, shown in Results, supports the hypothesis.

). The correlation coefficients were 0.91 (a) and 0.93 (b), proving that the significance would be similar if we utilized the whole human genome dataset in the analysis. The scale of the figures between the Y-axis and X-axis are different because of the different number of sequences taken from each chromosome.

Conclusions
We have developed a measure that statistically evaluates the degree of concentration of predicted TFBS in promoter sequences. Using this strategy to analyse various PWMs we have determined that predicted TFBS tend to cluster in human promoter sequences rather than in non-promoter sequences. Our results show that local concentrations of predicted TFBS in human promoter sequences are not a general characteristic of PWMs. Only a portion of identified PWM matches corresponded to TFBS occurring in clusters in promoter sequences. By computing partial correlation coefficients, we identified PWM sets associated with CGI and others that are independent of CGI. Transcription factors and binding sites associated with CGI-independent PWMs are likely to be involved in tissue-specific gene regulation. Indeed, using the CGI-related/dependent PWM sets, we extracted tissue-specific genes with high accuracy by detecting clusters of predicted TFBS. These results will be useful to interpret predicted transcription factor binding sites and to further understand the role of their formation into clusters. Ultimately, these findings will further elucidate the various functions of promoters, genes and transcription factors.

] with the keywords 'human', 'first intron', and 'enhancer'. This search yielded 194 papers. Replacing the keyword 'first intron' with 'second', 'third', 'fourth intron', 'fifth' or 'last intron' yielded 40, 15, 1, 1 and 6 papers, respectively. Replacing 'enhancer' with 'silencer' resulted in 281, 6, 3, 0, 0 and 0 papers, respectively. Removal of intron 1 from the data set greatly reduces the overall occurrence of regulatory elements in human intron sequences and allows our statistical analysis to be performed without significant interference from intronic regulatory sequences. Intergenic sequences are left out of the non-promoter dataset due the unknown occurrence of regulatory sequences.

]. If more than one matrix was matched to same transcription factor (prefix of "Identifier"), we selected a representative matrix with the highest quality and smallest suffix number according to the TRANSFAC definition. After scanning the sequences by MATCH, we set consecutive sampling windows (600 bp) in introns and promoter sequences, and then recorded corresponding TFBS predictions. To prevent double counting of palindromic binding sites, two matches for the same matrix at the same position was regarded as a single match and the match with the higher score was taken. Before MATCH ran, repeat sequences were masked to 'N' according to the annotation by RepeatMasker in the UCSC genome browser. From the above analysis we extracted 361, 129, and 278 promoter sequences from chromosomes 20, 21 and 22, respectively. The promoter sequences identified contained repeat sequences (e.g. ALU, L1) and simple repeats with low complexity, as observed in intron sequences. These sequences account for about 20% of all bases. To balance the rate of repeats between promoters and introns, we discarded intron sequences with high rates of repeats, so that the average rate of repeats in the intron samples was at the same level as in promoter sequences. The number of 600 bp intron sequences included in the analysis was 6,589 (chromosome 20), 4,324 (chromosome 21) and 4,531 (chromosome 22).
