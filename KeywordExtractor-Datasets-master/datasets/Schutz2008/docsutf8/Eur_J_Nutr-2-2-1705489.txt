Background
Resistant starch (RS) is known for potential health benefits in the human colon. To investigate these positive effects it is important to be able to predict the amount, and the structure of starch reaching the large intestine.

Aim of the study
The aim of this study was to compare two different in vitro models simulating the digestibility of two RS containing preparations.

Methods
The substrates, high amylose maize (HAM) containing RS type 2, and retrograded long chain tapioca maltodextrins (RTmd) containing RS type 3 were in vitro digested using a batch and a dynamic model, respectively. Both preparations were characterized before and after digestion by using X-Ray and DSC, and by measuring their total starch, RS and protein contents.

Results
Using both digestion models, 60-61 g/100 g of RTmd turned out to be indigestible, which is very well in accordance with 59 g/100 g found in vivo after feeding RTmd to ileostomy patients. In contrast, dynamic and batch in vitro digestion experiments using HAM as a substrate led to 58 g/100 g and 66 g/100 g RS recovery. The degradability of HAM is more affected by differences in experimental parameters compared to RTmd. The main variations between the two in vitro digestion methods are the enzyme preparations used, incubation times and mechanical stress exerted on the substrate. However, for both preparations dynamically digested fractions led to lower amounts of analytically RS and a lower crystallinity.

Conclusions
The two in vitro digestion methods used attacked the starch molecules differently, which influenced starch digestibility of HAM but not of RTmd.

Degradation products were removed by dialysis (Servapor 44146, Serva Feinbiochemica GmbH & Co., Heidelberg, Germany; cut-off 12–14 kDa) overnight under continuous movements against running deionized water <20°C. The retentate was freeze-dried. Based on total starch (TS) determinations in the starting materials and digestion residues, the amount of indigestible starch was calculated.

respectively. In the stomach the values were preset to pH 4.5, 2.8, 1.8, 1.7 and 1.5 at 0, 20, 40, 60 and 90 min, respectively. In the small intestine, the pH was maintained at 6.5, 6.8 and 7.2 in the duodenum, jejunum and ileum, respectively. About 1 ml trypsin solution (Sigma T4665, 2 g/l in solution A) was added to the duodenum at the beginning of the experiment. Secretions of porcine bile 4 g/100 g in water (Sigma B8631) and pancreatic solution 7 g/100 g in water (Pancrex-V powder, Paines & Byrne, Greenford, UK) entered the duodenal compartment at 0.5 and 0.25 ml/min, respectively. The absorption of water and digestive products from the jejunal and ileal compartments was simulated using hollow-fiber devices (cut-off 5–10 kDa). Ileal effluents (indigestible fraction) were collected after 2, 4 and 6 h, pooled and freeze-dried. Substrate remaining in the jejunum and ileum at the end of the experiment was considered to be indigestible as well and was therefore mixed with the ileal effluent pool. TS determinations of the starting materials, the digestion residues and the remaining substrate in the model after the experiment were carried out. Starch degradation products (up to DP 7) were quantified in dialysates by high-performance anion-exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection (HPAEC-PAD) in a BioLC System (Dionex Corp., Sunnyvale CA, USA) using a Carbo-Pac PA1 column and applying a sodium acetate gradient (unpublished, internal method). TS and oligosaccharide quantifications were recalculated as glucose content. The recovered glucose after the experiment (in the digestible and indigestible residues) was assumed as 100%, of which the indigestible fraction is expressed as a fraction.

Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements were performed using the Thermal Analyst system 2000 (DSC 2910, TA Instument Ltd, Newcastle, UK). Samples at a starch:water ratio of 1:4 were prepared and heated from 4°C to 200°C at 10°C/min, thereafter the samples were cooled at 20°C/min to 4°C and heated again at the same heating rate. All the DSC results were evaluated from the mean of three separate determinations for each sample, unless stated otherwise.

 lower amounts of RS (28–62%) were found in the digestion residues. This can be explained by the fact that the digestion method carried out prior to the analytical RS determination has an influence on the starch structures leading to less resistant starch. Therefore, analysing RS in digestion residues may be interpreted as characterization method, indicating the highly resistant fraction. Different amounts of RS were found because of additional non-starch material present in the samples as described above. Calculating RS recoveries based on TS led to 50 g/100 g TS for the dynamically digested RTmd fractions, whereas after batch and in vivo digestion similar amounts (69 and 65 g/100 g TS, respectively) were found. In contrast, clearly lower RS amounts were found in both HAM digestion residues (37 and 44 g/100 g) after dynamic and batch digestion, respectively.

Discussion
Digestibility of RS preparations
In vitro digestion models use a strictly standardized procedure based on an average human digestibility. Therefore standard deviations of in vitro experiments are expected to be low. In vitro obtained HAM fractions showed higher standard deviations compared to in vitro digested RTmd fractions. Possibly the molecular structures of HAM have been more sensitive to small differences in experimental conditions such as mechanical stress, temperature or pH between experiments.

, 99% of in vitro digestible RTmd fractions were degraded after 4 h, whereas only 86% of those of HAM were digested at this stage. If the dynamic digestion experiment would have been stopped after 4 h (the duration of the batch digestion experiment is 3.75 h), the remaining indigestible fraction of HAM would be identical to that obtained by the batch in vitro digestion. Whether a prolongation of the batch incubation would lead to HAM fractions similar to those obtained with the dynamic model, remains to be elucidated.

). This leads to the assumption that in the dynamic approach starch structures are attacked to a higher extent compared to the batch model. Nevertheless, the amount of TS recovered after digestion of RTmd was not affected, whereas the TS recovery of HAM possibly was influenced by the different amount of analytical RS present in the sample; the results strongly indicate that structural features play an important role in digestibility.

] suggested that the enthalpy of gelatinization primarily reflects the loss of the double helical order which could occur to a higher extent during dynamic digestion.



Conclusions
The results of this study show that both, a simple and a more sophisticated in vitro digestion model and the ileostomy study led to similar amounts of starch escaping digestion when using a RS3 containing carbohydrate source as substrate. In contrast, when the two in vitro digestion models were compared with a RS2 containing preparation, different amounts of indigestible starch were found. It is not possible to predict which model simulated the in vivo RS2 fraction more precisely. The more sophisticated in vitro digestion model attacked starch probably more strongly compared to the batch in vitro digestion model using an RS2 and an RS3 containing substrate. This was confirmed by differences in crystalline fractions and structural rearrangements as measured by X-ray and DSC measurements. These structural differences, caused by different experimental parameters influenced starch digestibility of HAM but not of RTmd. The behavior of other RS preparations in the two in vitro models described here can not be deduced from the obtained results and has to be examined case by case.
