In the case report herein, although there was a GC in the maternal grandfather, the family history was more striking for the large number of breast cancer cases. This highlights the particular challenges we currently face with regard to counseling these families which appear to be mainly breast cancer, as it is unknown if the penetrance of DGC in this family is as high as it is in other HDGC pedigrees.

 mutations and the risks with regard to DGC and LBC, however as the recognised spectrum of related cancers broadens, more affected families will be identified and successfully managed with regard to avoidance of specific cancer risks. Longer life expectancy in individuals with penetrant mutations could potentially lead to the development of different, later onset disease as yet to be identified in these kindreds. This represents a particular challenge in hereditary cancer practice as the clinical community tends to be segregated into organ specific specialties where as the cancer risks and the risk reduction strategies for germline mutation carriers require a variety of expertise. The medical needs of the HDGC families are therefore best served through an engaged multidisciplinary team.
