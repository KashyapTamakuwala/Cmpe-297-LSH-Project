. If their behaviour during wastewater treatment could be more reliably related to process design and operating conditions, process performance could possibly be improved by alteration of these conditions in accordance with the types of molecule that are difficult to eliminate.

Experimental
Materials and standards
Chemical standards of carbamazepine, lansoprazole, loratidine, famotidine, trimethoprim, ofloxacin, atenolol, metoprolol, azithromycin dihydrate, erythromycin hydrate, fluoxetine hydrochloride, ranitidine hydrochloride, sulfamethoxazole, propranolol hydrochloride, indomethacin, acetaminophen, mefenamic acid, clofibric acid, bezafibrate, mevastatin, and sotalol hydrochloride were purchased from Sigma–Aldrich (Steinheim, Germany), propyphenazone, pravastatin, and paroxetine hydrochloride from LGC Promochem (London, UK), ketoprofen, diclofenac, gemfibrozil, ibuprofen, and naproxen from Jescuder (Rubí, Spain), glibenclamide from SIFA Chemicals (Liestal, Switzerland), and hydrochlorothiazide from Pliva (Zagreb, Croatia). All pharmaceutical standards were of high-purity grade (>90%).

].
The MBR was operated in parallel with the CAS process (aeration tank and secondary settling tank). The biocenosis of the MBR was grown from inoculated sludge from the municipal WWTP (aeration basin) and cultivated over a period of approximately 1 month to reach steady-state conditions. The hydraulic retention time was set to 14 h by regulating the effluent flow and the SRT was infinite, because no sludge was discharged from the reactor.

Wastewater-treatment plant (WWTP)

. A mixture of municipal, hospital, and industrial wastewater is treated. Treatment consists of pretreatment, preliminary treatment, primary sedimentation, and secondary (biological) treatment. Pretreated wastewater goes through a physical process of settling in a primary clarifier. Secondary treatment occurs in pre-denitrification (anaerobic) and nitrification (aerobic) tanks, and two secondary clarifiers. Secondary sludge is recirculated to a primary clarifier which improves the settling characteristics of the primary sludge and increases sludge age. A mixture of primary and secondary (activated) sludge is processed (thickening, dewatering) and anaerobically digested, and biogas produced is used to heat a digester. The hydraulic retention time of CAS treatment in WWTP Rubí, calculated for the average daily flow, is approximately 12 h. During the sampling programme the plant was operating with an SRT of approximately 3 days. WWTP effluent is discharged into the river Riera de Rubí, which flows into the Mediterranean sea.

]. The two processes abiotic (adsorption) and biotic degradation (transformation by microorganisms) could not be distinguished, because no method was developed for analysis of the target compounds in sludge. The term “removal” is therefore used here for conversion of a micropollutant to compounds other than the parent compound.

For ketoprofen, diclofenac, bezafibrate, and gemfibrozil removal by the MBR system was very high and uniform (>90%), with the exception of two sampling programme. It is assumed this variation could have been a result of reduced microbial activity or altered sorption and flocculation conditions. No plausible explanation can be given for the drastically reduced efficiency of removal of clofibric and mefenamic acid by MBR in two sampling programmes; otherwise these were eliminated with efficiencies between 65 and 90%. High and steady removal (>80%) in the MBR was also observed for ranitidine and ofloxacin. In conventional treatment all these pharmaceuticals were eliminated with a wide range of efficiencies, always lower than those obtained by the MBR. Better removal of readily biodegradable micropollutants by the MBR could be because of the smaller flock size of the sludge, which enhances mass transfer by diffusion and therefore increases elimination. Taking into consideration the composition of sludge originating from a membrane bioreactor (specialized microorganisms, large amount of active biomass in suspended solids) improved removal is to be expected; this was confirmed by our experiments.

Efficiency of removal of atenolol, metoprolol, pravastatin, erythromycin, and indomethacin varied in both MBR and CAS treatment. This could not be explained. Fluctuation of elimination efficiency was also observed for propyphenazone (44.8–82.9% for MBR and 6.82–62.6% for CAS) and glibenclamide (14.8–73.7% for MBR and 11.9–79.7% for CAS).
Effluent concentrations greater than those recorded for the influent could be explained by the presence of input conjugate compounds that are transformed into the original compounds during treatment. Because these conjugates were not included in the analysis, no firm conclusion can be made about their biotransformation, especially because sampling inaccuracy can also lead to errors.

Conclusion
Several pharmaceutical products (e.g. ibuprofen, naproxen, acetaminophen, ketoprofen, diclofenac, bezafibrate, gemfibrozil, ranitidine, ofloxacin, hydrochlorothiazide, and paroxetine) with high rates of attenuation can be expected to be completely removed from wastewater by adsorption or degradation, or a combination of both, during membrane treatment. For most of the compounds investigated MBR effluent concentrations were significantly lower than in the effluent from conventional treatment. Elimination of hydrochlorothiazide and paroxetine was slightly better in CAS treatment. Some substances (e.g. carbamazepine) were not removed by either MBR or CAS treatment. No relationship was found between the structures of target compounds and their removal during wastewater treatment, however. The range of variation of the efficiency of removal by the MBR system was small for most of the compounds; in conventional treatment greater fluctuations were observed and removal efficiency was found to be much more sensitive to changes in operating conditions (temperature, flow rate, etc).
Although membrane technology seems a promising means of removal of pharmaceutical compounds, the MBR process investigated would not completely halt discharge of micropollutants. Membrane treatment processes should be optimized by modification of the membranes (variation of the materials and reduction of molecular mass cut-off limits) and/or by modification of the treatment process (inoculation of special microorganisms). The efficiencies of diverse microbial populations in elimination of selected pharmaceuticals, and optimization of design and operating conditions of a laboratory-scale MBR will be the main objectives of our future investigations. That would provide guidelines for scale-up of a biological pilot plant and its evaluation by integration into an industrial process water-recycling system. Because of the current lack of information on the behaviour of pharmaceuticals in surface and wastewaters, however, further studies are required on the occurrence, fate, and effects of these substances in the environment.
