Background
in utero
 exposure to estrogenic agents could induce these disorders was first proposed in 1993. The only quantitative summary estimate of the association between prenatal exposure to estrogenic agents and testicular cancer was published over 10 years ago, and other systematic reviews of the association between estrogenic compounds, other than the potent pharmaceutical estrogen diethylstilbestrol (DES), and TDS end points have remained inconclusive.

Objectives
We conducted a quantitative meta-analysis of the association between the end points related to TDS and prenatal exposure to estrogenic agents. Inclusion in this analysis was based on mechanistic criteria, and the plausibility of an estrogen receptor (ER)-α–mediated mode of action was specifically explored.

Results
We included in this meta-analysis eight studies investigating the etiology of hypospadias and/or cryptorchidism that had not been identified in previous systematic reviews. Four additional studies of pharmaceutical estrogens yielded a statistically significant updated summary estimate for testicular cancer.

Conclusions
The doubling of the risk ratios for all three end points investigated after DES exposure is consistent with a shared etiology and the TDS hypothesis but does not constitute evidence of an estrogenic mode of action. Results of the subset analyses point to the existence of unidentified sources of heterogeneity between studies or within the study population.

). A hormonal etiology most likely underlies this syndrome, although it is believed to have more than one cause, possibly including other than endocrine disruption. Some common causes of endocrine disruption include infection, diet and body weight, lifestyle, genetics, and environmental exposure, but endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), particularly those with estrogen-like properties, have received the most scientific attention.

). In this review we focus on the estrogen hypothesis of TDS.
Toppari et al. 1996
). The primary objective of a quantitative meta-analysis is to combine the results of previous studies examining a specific research question to arrive at a summary conclusion about a body of research. It has been found particularly useful when individual studies are too small to yield a valid conclusion, but it cannot, however, correct for bias and confounding. When applied to observational studies, subset analysis can be a useful tool to explore the reasons for discrepancies among the results of different studies.
The objectives of this research were therefore to carry out a quantitative meta-analysis of the association between three of the end points related to TDS and prenatal exposure to estrogenic agents that would account for both the size and quality of the studies included and yield updated summary estimates in light of the body of research carried out since the formulation of the estrogen hypothesis. Inclusion in this analysis was based on mechanistic criteria, and the plausibility of an ER-α–mediated mode of action was specifically explored. Moreover, subset analysis has been applied to categories of compounds with estrogenic potencies differing by several orders of magnitude in an attempt to detect the existence of any potency–response trend. Most of the studies of sperm quantity or quality have been concerned with time trends rather than etiology, and this end point was not considered further here.

Studies of maternal endogenous hormones.

Data extraction and quality rating
In addition to the number of exposed and nonexposed cases and controls, and risk ratios (RRs) with their confidence intervals (CIs), information regarding the study design, estrogenic agent, geographic location of the study, and year of publication were extracted from the selected literature to allow subset analysis to be carried out. When more than one RR was reported, the following priorities were set for choice:
Adjusted RRs were used, except when the study provided only unadjusted estimates.

When multiple estimates were given, the RR estimator on which the authors had relied for their assessment of causal association was used.

Overall RRs were chosen instead of those derived from further stratifications. If an overall estimate was not provided, the RRs of the maximum duration of exposure or the maximum exposure concentration were chosen.


Altman 1991
Rushton 2000
). Every criterion was assessed on a scale of 0 to 2, 0 suggesting that it was not present, 1 when it was unclear, and 2 when that criterion was satisfied. A maximum score of 50 and 52 could be assigned for retrospective (case–control) and prospective (cohort and clinical trials) studies, respectively. This enabled a quality sensitivity analysis to be performed to check the influence of studies with low quality on the pooled estimate.

Data analysis
Graphical representation
Sterne et al. 2001
). Forest plots present the RRs against the reference of the study and help check homogeneity visually.

Statistical pooling
Pooled estimates and 95% CIs were calculated using both a fixed-effects model (Mantel–Haenszel method) and a random-effects model (DerSimonian–Laird method), allowing evaluation of the dependence of the conclusions of the analysis on the model assumptions. A summary estimate is considered statistically significant at the 0.05 level if its CI does not include unity.
Q
 tends to be small. Tests of heterogeneity in meta-analyses are generally low in their power to reject the null hypothesis of homogeneity. For this reason, the chi-square statistical test of homogeneity was carried out at both 0.05 and 0.1 significance levels. Additionally, pooled estimates calculated using fixed effect and random effect models differ only if there is lack of homogeneity between studies. The estimates obtained by both methods were therefore compared to better assess potential heterogeneity between studies, in which case a single summary estimate of effect may be considered inappropriate.

Subset and sensitivity analyses
To investigate potential sources of heterogeneity between studies, we performed subset analyses for the study design, estrogenic agent, and geographic location.
Some studies exploring the influence of hormonal treatment during pregnancy did not specify the type of hormone. From what is known of the hormonal treatment of common conditions occurring during pregnancy, it was deemed reasonable to assume that they would have been likely to include estrogens, and these studies were included in the analysis. The validity of this assumption was tested by applying stricter criteria and calculating a summary estimate of effect excluding any study in which the hormone used had not been specified. Further sensitivity analysis was performed by excluding low-quality studies and extremes (exclusion of the studies with the largest and smallest RR estimators and exclusion of the studies with the largest and smallest weights) to verify that either the quality of the studies or one particular study did not have an excessive influence on the pooled estimate.

Other than 2 recent studies for which pesticide exposure was determined by chemical analysis of specific compounds, assessment of exposure to pesticides is generally derived from the occupation of the mother and specific agents are not identified.

) by those smaller positive studies would be consistent with publication bias. These two extreme positive risk ratios were, however, reported after what is commonly referred to as “third-generation exposure” to DES, when the mother herself had been exposed to DES prenatally. It was recognized that the inclusion of such studies in the meta-analysis could have introduced heterogeneity, and the influence of this choice was investigated in the subset analysis. Plots of the quality score and RRs versus year of publication did not suggest any significant trends in quality of the studies or estimates of effect over time (not shown).

 cannot be underestimated, as shown by the sensitivity analysis. Exclusion of this study from the analysis yielded a statistically significant Mantel–Haenszel estimate but a lower and not statistically significant DerSimonian–Laird estimate, revealing heterogeneity. A statistically significant estimate was obtained for prospective studies by the Mantel–Haenszel method, but the wide difference with the estimate using the random effect model was suggestive of heterogeneity. Geographic subsets point to a higher risk in Latin America, although the pooled estimates for this location were based on only two studies and did not reach statistical significance.

. This had little influence on the overall result, generating summary estimates of 0.97 (95% CI, 0.83–1.13) for the fixed effect model or 0.93 (95% CI, 0.80–1.09) for the random effect model.

. This resulted in a slightly lower Mantel–Haenszel estimate of 1.98 (95% CI, 1.23–3.18) and if the DerSimonian–Laird estimate remained equal to 1.59, because of the wider confidence interval (95% CI, 0.93–2.69), statistical significance was no longer achieved. The sensitivity analysis is consistent with some heterogeneity between the studies, the estimates obtained being relatively sensitive to the exclusion of particular studies varying above and below a risk estimate of 2. The quality of the studies seemed to explain at least some of this heterogeneity.

 inferred exposure to phthalates from registry data about occupation, and although such an approach can allow the analysis of a great number of cases, assessment of exposure is much more likely to be prone to confounding. The number of studies included in meta-analyses lies typically between 5 and 15, and the results presented here also fall within this range. The size of the homogeneity test statistic depends on both the number and size of individual studies. The funnel plots offer a good visual representation of the precision and size of individual studies, and it is clear that most studies published on the association between estrogenic agents and the probable end points of a TDS were found to be relatively small. The chi-square tests had, therefore, a relatively low power to detect heterogeneity. However, in the absence of statistical heterogeneity, the results of the fixed effect and random effect models should be virtually identical, and the comparison of results obtained by applying both the Mantel–Haenszel and DerSimonian–Laird models enabled the exploration of sources of heterogeneity despite this low statistical power.

), epidemiologic evidence remains elusive. Alternatively, the doubling of the risk estimates of all three effects associated with DES exposure would be consistent with a shared etiology and the TDS hypothesis. It does not constitute conclusive evidence of an estrogenic mode of action, however, as common etiologic factors could be related to the underlying condition for which DES was prescribed. Furthermore hypospadias, cryptorchidism, and testicular cancer have all been found to be associated with low birth weight, suggesting a potential association with an underlying placental defect.

Conclusion
The modest increase in risk for all three end points associated with DES exposure is consistent with a shared etiology and the TDS hypothesis, whereas the results of the subset analyses suggest the existence of yet unidentified sources of heterogeneity between studies or within the study populations. Although 10 years of further research on the potential effects of endocrine disruptors on male reproductive health have provided some clues regarding the etiology and mechanism of conditions such as hypospadias, cryptorchidism, and testicular cancer, there is still no conclusive evidence of the role played by environmental estrogens.
