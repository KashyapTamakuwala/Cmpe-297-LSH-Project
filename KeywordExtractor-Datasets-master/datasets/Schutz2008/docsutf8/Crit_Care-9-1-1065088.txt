Rapid and efficient cooling is the most important therapeutic objective in patients with heat stroke (HS). This article reviews the mechanism of action and rationale for the use of dantrolene as a potential supportive cooling method in the treatment of HS. Relevant studies were included to support discussion of the role of dantrolene for the treatment of HS. In some studies dantrolene was shown to accelerate cooling rate when administered after the development of exertional HS. Dantrolene was also found to be effective in reducing the extent of HS signs when given as pretreatment in an animal model. Accumulated data do not support the routine use of dantrolene as an adjuvant cooling technique in HS, but administration of this drug in severe cases, or in which no improvement is observed, appears rational. Further trials are needed in order to assess the true effectiveness of dantrolene in HS.

Introduction
per se 
may be physiological and can be compensated for (as in the moderate elevation in core temperature that occurs in an exercising and otherwise asymptomatic individual), or it may be pathophysiological but generally well tolerated. It may also be associated with adverse pathophysiological consequences such as inability to continue physical exertion (heat exhaustion). At the extreme, hyperthermia represents a state in which the elevation in core temperature is either already accompanied by organ injury or is sufficient to produce such injury if left untreated.

Data from Saudi Arabia show a seasonal incidence pattern, ranging from 22 to 250 cases per 100,000 capita. The crude mortality rate in Saudi Arabia has been estimated at 50%. Treatment consists of immediate cooling and support of organ system function.

Dantrolene use in heat stroke

] reported that intravenous dantrolene (20 mg bolus) therapy produced rapid recovery in a young soldier suffering from EHS after a march.
16
]. Intravenous administration of dantrolene (5 mg/kg) did not significantly improve cooling rates, haemodynamic parameters, pathological changes, or clinical outcome when compared with passive cooling.
17
] conducted a study in which 20 EHS patients were randomly assigned to two groups with only one group receiving dantrolene (2.45 mg/kg intravenously). Patients in both groups were cooled either using the Makkah body cooling unit or by 'conventional methods', namely spraying of tap water over the patients while fanning. Cooling rates were found to be significantly higher in the dantrolene group. All patients survived and there was no difference in the incidence of neurological sequelae between the groups.
21
]. All patients were treated by using a body cooling unit in which atomized water was sprayed over the victim while they were fanned with hot air. In addition, treatment with either dantrolene (2 mg/kg) or placebo was given intravenously after blind, randomized selection.
21
] treated their patients with dantrolene and mannitol simultaneously. Thus, it could not be concluded whether the reported positive effects were attributed to dantrolene or to mannitol.
38
39
19
] designed a randomized controlled study in which heat stroked piglets were treated by one of the following four methods: passive cooling, 'conventional cooling' (intravenous fluid resuscitation, sponging with tap water, mechanical fanning and ice gastric lavage), conventional cooling along with dantrolene, and conventional cooling along with mannitol. Although dantrolene significantly shortened the cooling time when compared with conventional cooling, it did not shorten the cooling time when compared with mannitol. Moreover, it was shown that dantrolene did not improve cardiovascular parameters when administered in addition to conventional methods.
20
] investigated whether dantrolene might be advantageous in prophylaxis against HS in exercising sheep. They found that pretreatment with dantrolene (3 mg/kg and 1.5 mg/kg intravenously) caused a significant reduction in body temperature, and decreased the extent of HS signs as well as some of the induced changes in enzymes and hormones. These effects were more significant in the group receiving dantrolene 3 mg/kg than in the group receiving 1.5 mg/kg. The dantrolene group also exhibited a trend toward reduced mortality from HS (0/12) in comparison with the group that did not receive dantrolene treatment (2/6).
18
] studied the efficacy of dantrolene both as a prophylactic agent and as a therapeutic drug. Administration of high doses of dantrolene (140 mg/kg intravenously) before heat stress delayed the development of HS in the sedentary animals. Estimated temperatures were lower in the exercising rats that received Dantrolene pretreatment, but this was most reasonably attributed to the limited physical capacity induced by dantrolene. When dantrolene, at the same dose, was administered after the development of HS, it significantly improved the cooling rate in the exercising rats – an effect that was not seen in the sedentary group.

Discussion

P magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Therefore, there is some evidence to suggest that a subset of individuals with HS may also be predisposed to MH. Theoretically, this subset of individuals might continue to have a relatively high level of heat production even after collapse. They may also be at increased risk for EHS because an attenuated muscular efficiency can increase muscular caloric production at the same absolute work intensity. The fact that some individuals with HS might have a contribution of MH-type pathophysiology might also explain why there has been anecdotal evidence suggesting a possible benefit from dantrolene in selected cases.
17
19
]. However, this effect was not demonstrated in all studies. The diversity of results may be accounted for by the models investigated. When dantrolene was administered in an exercising model, it was found to be more effective than in a CHS model. This is not surprising because dantrolene inhibits muscle contraction, which does not play a role in the pathophysiology of CHS.

] had a rectal temperature of 42°C for more than 30 min and responded only to dantrolene. Noteworthy, the authors did not state the upper recording limit of their thermometer. If a clinical thermometer has an upper limit of 42°C, then it will record 42°C when the actual temperature is 46°C. Despite successful cooling for 30 min, the thermometer still shows 42°C even though the temperature has been reduced by 4°C. Taking dantrolene at this instant will lead to an impressive, albeit misinterpreted, result.

] postulated that an increased dose of dantrolene may be associated with hepatotoxicity. The risk for hepatotoxicity is even more concrete in HS patients because the liver is commonly injured in HS and increasing the dose of dantrolene may worsen this hepatic damage. Nevertheless, hepatotoxicity has never been reported in HS victims who received dantrolene.

20
]. However, the effect of dantrolene on muscle contracture may result in limited physical capacity. Furthermore, the administration of dantrolene before HS is more theoretical than real because the incidence of EHS is negligible in comparison with the number of individuals who are engaged in physical activity and/or are exposed to heat strain.

Conclusion
Therapy with the accepted MH prophylactic dose of 2–5 mg/kg resulted in a possible benefit from dantrolene treatment in HS in some studies, whereas in others it was not found to be effective. The limited literature does not support the routine use of dantrolene as an adjuvant cooling technique in the setting of HS. Nevertheless, because dantrolene does appear to increase cooling rate, furthur studies are advised for dantrolene use in severe cases or cases in which no improvement is observed with other cooling methods. Wider trials are still needed to evaluate the efficacy of dantrolene in reducing mortality, thereby justifying its use in HS. Noteworthy, dantrolene should not be used as a single cooling method, and its administration should only be in addition to the well established 'conventional methods'.
