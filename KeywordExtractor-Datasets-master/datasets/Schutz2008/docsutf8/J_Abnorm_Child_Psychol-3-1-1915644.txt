In a community sample of 116 children, assessments of parent-child interaction, parent-child attachment, and various parental, child, and contextual characteristics at 15 and 28 months and at age 5 were used to predict externalizing behavior at age 5, as rated by parents and teachers. Hierarchical multiple regression analysis and path analysis yielded a significant longitudinal model for the prediction of age 5 externalizing behavior, with independent contributions from the following predictors: child sex, partner support reported by the caregiver, disorganized infant-parent attachment at 15 months, child anger proneness at 28 months, and one of the two parent-child interaction factors observed at 28 months, namely negative parent-child interactions. The other, i.e., a lack of effective guidance, predicted externalizing problems only in highly anger-prone children. Furthermore, mediated pathways of influence were found for the parent-child interaction at 15 months (via disorganized attachment) and parental ego-resiliency (via negative parent-child interaction at 28 months).

) differ in the emphasis they place on the role of certain etiological factors, they agree in the assumption that multiple factors from various domains additively and interactively contribute to the emergence and maintenance of externalizing problems. Taken together, four domains of factors have been proposed to contribute to their development: (a) parent-child interaction and parent-child attachment, (b) child characteristics (e.g., temperament and cognitive abilities), (c) parental characteristics (e.g., personality), and (d) contextual characteristics (e.g., socioeconomic status, partner support, and stressful life events).

). Consequently, it is possible that factors that predict externalizing problems in samples with one or more risk factors fail to do so in samples with lower levels of risk, such as the present sample. In light of this, studying the early predictors of externalizing problems in a community sample constitutes an important extension of the existing research evidence collected in high-risk samples.
The criteria on which we based our selection of the various predictors and our hypotheses regarding their joint contribution to the development of externalizing problems – led by various interrelated theoretical models – are described per domain in the following paragraphs.

In view of the above, we expected infant attachment insecurity and particularly attachment disorganization to be related to elevated levels of externalizing behavior at age 5. Considering that attachment patterns have been found to reflect the history of parent-child interactions, we expected the association between the early parent-child interaction and later externalizing problems to be at least partially mediated by the quality of the infant-parent attachment.

). In line with these findings, we anticipated high levels of child negativity and low levels of fearfulness in infancy and toddlerhood, particularly in interaction with parenting, to predict the development of externalizing problems.

), parental ego-resiliency was found to be related to the infants’ socioemotional development, partially via the quality of the parent-infant interaction. Based on the above and in line with the 15-month findings, we expected higher levels of parental ego-resiliency to predict lower levels of externalizing behavior in the children at age 5, and we expected this relation to be mediated by lower quality parent-child interactions.

). Nevertheless, based on earlier findings, we expected stressful life events, partner support, and SES to contribute to the development of externalizing behavior problems.
In sum, the aim of the present study was to predict the occurrence of externalizing behavior problems in a sample of 5-year-old children on the basis of various parental, child, dyadic, and contextual factors assessed at 15 and 28 months and at age 5. We expected the following specific factors to independently or interactively contribute to the development of externalizing problems: (a) a low quality of parent-child interaction at 15 and 28 months; (b) disorganized parent-infant attachment; (c) child temperament (i.e., high anger proneness and low fearfulness) at both 15 and 28 months and particularly in interaction with low quality parenting; (d) low levels of child cognitive ability at 15 months; (e) low parental ego-resiliency; (f) high incidence of stressful life events between 15 months and 5 years; (g) lack of partner support; and (h) low SES. Furthermore, the contribution of parental ego-resiliency to child externalizing behavior was expected to be mediated by the quality of parent-child interaction, and the contribution of the early parent-child interaction by the quality of infant-parent attachment.

Although anger proneness was not significantly correlated with externalizing behavior, it had a significant Beta weight. This effect seems due to a suppressor variable. As recommended by Tabachnick & Fidell (1989), predictors were systematically deleted from the regression equation to identify which variable is the suppressor, indicating that D versus non-D attachment acted as the suppressor variable.

). According to this procedure, three conditions must hold in order to establish mediation: (a) the predictor is significantly associated with the outcome, (b) the predictor is significantly associated with the mediator, and (c) the mediator is significantly associated with the outcome. If these conditions hold in the predicted direction, mediation is proven when the effect of the predictor on the outcome is shown to decrease when the mediator is also entered as a predictor in the regression equation.

). At the 5-year assessment, the selective drop-out of families with relatively low ego-resilient parents seemed to make the risk status of the remaining sample even lower. In this light, our finding that the children had higher CBCL and TRF externalizing scores than the relevant normative Dutch samples is puzzling. It may be that the level of externalizing behavior problems has increased over the last few years; unfortunately, no recent normative data are available. An alternative explanation may be that in middle-class communities, families with concerns about their children’s development are more likely to volunteer for research studies. Because relevant information is not available for the present sample, this remains an issue for further study.

). Rather than an association with negative parent-child interactions and hence in contrast to earlier reports, our findings showed temperament to interact with a different dimension of the parent-child interaction, namely a lack of effective guidance. This is not to say that negative parent-child interactions as such carried no weight in the prediction of externalizing problems in the present study. Quite the contrary, the factor proved to be one of the most powerful predictors of externalizing behavior problems in the present study and this was true for all the children in our sample and not just for a subsample of temperamentally difficult children.
Our results on the interaction between temperament and parenting in the development of externalizing problems extend those of earlier studies by showing that a specific temperament by parenting interaction may work particularly in a specific developmental phase. That the interaction between anger proneness and effective guidance proved to predict externalizing problems particularly for toddlers makes sense when interpreted from a developmental psychopathology perspective: establishing autonomy and learning to comply with social rules and expectations are major developmental tasks for toddlers that challenge the parents’ ability to provide effective guidance by imposing structure and setting limits while at the same time remaining emotionally supportive of the child. As a result of the child’s striving for autonomy, the second year is marked by parent-toddler conflicts. Toddlers that are prone to show angry behaviors in such discord situations are particularly in need of effective guidance in order to prevent their lack of emotional and behavioral self-control to further escalate and evolve into externalizing behavior problems.

) and support Greenberg’s (1999) model that considers parent-child interaction and parent-child attachment as two different domains that contribute independently to a child’s development but that also reciprocally influence one another.
The results of this study may have clinical and policy implications. Many studies have shown that children born in disadvantaged environments are at risk for developing externalizing problems later in life. The present study showed that, also for children living in presumably lower-risk families, certain characteristics in infancy and toddlerhood indicate an increased risk of externalizing problems at preschool age. It should be kept in mind, however, that our sample may have been more at risk than originally thought, because a relatively large proportion of children turned out to have externalizing behavior scores above the subclinical cutoff. An important practical implication of our findings is that one of the most powerful predictors identified in the present study, i.e., negative parent-child interactions, is relatively easy to observe already in infancy and proves to be highly stable, which makes it an interesting candidate for inclusion in early community mental health screening procedures. And the specific interaction of the other parent-child interaction factor (i.e., effective guidance) with temperamental anger proneness in toddlerhood in predicting later externalizing problems also suggests that paying more attention to early parent-child interactions may be useful in early detection of children at risk and in preventive intervention programs for parents in community mental health care. But more research is needed, of course, to further explore these possible applications.

). A third limitation of the study is that we did not have additional information about earlier externalizing behavior and about characteristics of the children and families prior to our first 15-month assessment at our disposal. Future research that includes observations earlier in infancy may further improve our understanding of the mechanisms involved in the early development of externalizing problems. A fourth limitation lies in the relatively small sample size. The sample was small by epidemiological standards, particularly with regard to evaluating mediator and moderator effects. And as a fifth and final limitation of the present study it should be mentioned that we based our assessments of the quality of infant-parent attachment on an abbreviated version of the Strange Situation that includes one as opposed to two separations from the parent. Despite the evidence supporting the validity of the abbreviated procedure (see Method section), it is possible that we have underestimated the number of D children given that in the regular Strange Situation Procedure children may be classified as disorganized based on their reunion behavior after the second separation. Anyhow, the present study shows that D attachment, even when assessed with the abbreviated Strange Situation, was a powerful predictor of later externalizing behavior problems.
In sum, the longitudinal model our analyses generated provides more insight into the complex interplay among parental, child, dyadic and contextual characteristics that together shape the development of externalizing behavior from age 15 months onwards. Future research should reveal whether the predictive power of the model can be improved, for instance by including earlier measurements and by taking into account the children’s early experiences with the other parent and with their caregivers and peers in child-care facilities.
