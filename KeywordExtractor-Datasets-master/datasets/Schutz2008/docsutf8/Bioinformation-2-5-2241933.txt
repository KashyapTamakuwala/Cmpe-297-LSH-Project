Gene function annotation remains a key challenge in modern biology. This is especially true for high-throughput techniques such as gene expression experiments. 
Vital information about genes is available electronically from biomedical literature in the form of full texts and abstracts. In addition, various publicly 
available databases (such as GenBank, Gene Ontology and Entrez) provide access to gene-related information at different levels of biological organization, 
granularity and data format. This information is being used to assess and interpret the results from high-throughput experiments. To improve keyword extraction 
for annotational clustering and other types of analyses, we have developed a novel text mining approach, which is based on keywords identified at the level of 
gene annotation sentences (in particular sentences characterizing biological function) instead of entire abstracts. Further, to improve the expressiveness and 
usefulness of gene annotation terms, we investigated the combination of sentence-level keywords with terms from the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and Gene 
Ontology (GO) resources. We find that sentence-level keywords combined with MeSH terms outperforms the typical ‘baseline’ set-up (term frequencies at the level 
of abstracts) by a significant margin, whereas the addition of GO terms improves matters only marginally. We validated our approach on the basis of a manually 
annotated corpus of 200 abstracts generated on the basis of 2 cancer categories and 10 genes per category. We applied the method in the context of three sets of 
differentially expressed genes obtained from pediatric brain tumor samples. This analysis suggests novel interpretations of discovered gene expression patterns.

with the goal of improving clustering quality and efficiency. However, gene clustering using entire abstracts has the following main drawbacks. (a) Abstracts normally contain a 
large number of irrelevant sentences. These sentences may influence the clustering process and are likely to obscure information useful for gene annotation. (b) The number of 
unique terms in abstracts is typically very large. This requires the ability to deal with sparse data spaces or methods for dimensionality reduction. (c) Dimension reduction 
methods such as principal component analysis or signal-to-noise methods increase the computational complexity, may lead to the loss of important keywords and do not guarantee 
that the reduced dimensionality will yield better clustering/annotation information. Also, the composite features may be hard to interpret.

We validated the performance of keywords extracted by our method using a manually annotated corpus of 200 abstracts. We also evaluated the usefulness of our method by sorting 
differentially expressed genes from a microarray experiment into functional sub-groups. The objective of our gene clustering process using functional keywords is to identify and 
summarize potential functional gene groups and to complement the conventional gene expression data clustering tasks.

Keywords extraction from biomedical literature
In our study each gene is represented by a list of keywords extracted from MEDLINE abstract sentences, MeSH terms and GO terms. The procedure for extracting keywords from each data 
source is discussed below.

MEDLINE abstracts keywords extraction
sentences
 from the abstracts instead of constructing a large keyword vector based on the entire 
abstract. The assumption is that the information given on sentence-level is much more specific and therefore useful to characterize the function of the genes. Only sentences that contain 
one or more genes reference from our gene lists will be considered as gene annotation sentences, all other sentences are discarded from the analysis. We applied the following three steps 
to extract sentence-level keywords (1) gene-name normalization, (2) sentence filtering, and (3) keyword extraction.

Gene-name normalization
This process replaces all the gene names in the abstract with its unique canonical identifier (Entrez gene ID) using the gene-synonym dictionary specially constructed for this study.

Sentence keyword extraction

] This program labels each word in a sentence with its part-of-speech information such as 
word category like noun, verb, adjective, preposition, etc. This information plays a critical role in identifying corresponding noun and verb phrases. Then, with a simple PERL program, noun 
phrases containing gene names were filtered out and the remaining noun phrases and verb phrases were extracted as keywords. Initial tests showed that certain keywords were common for most of 
the genes in the list (e.g., activates, associates, stimulates etc.). We manually removed these common keyword words from the list. The following example illustrates this process:
Sentence
BRCA1 physically associates with p53 and stimulates its transcriptional activity.

Brill-POS-tagged sentence
BRCA1/NNP physically/RB associates/VBZ with/IN p53/NN and/CC stimulates/VBZ its/PRP$ transcriptional/JJ activity/NN. /.

Sentence keywords

MeSH keywords extraction
To extract MeSH keywords, we searched for the gene names in our gene lists in the title and abstract of MEDLINE citations related to each gene and extracted the associated MeSH terms for 
each gene. The extracted gene-MeSH term list was represented by scores indicating the frequency of gene-MeSH term co-occurrence. Initial tests showed that certain MeSH keywords in the list 
were common biological terms and less useful from the point of view of gene annotation (e.g., human, DNA, animal, Support U.S Govt etc.). A collection of MeSH stop words was created manually 
and these terms were removed from the gene-MeSH term lists. Finally, from the thus filtered gene-MeSH lists, the 20 highest-frequency MeSH terms associated with each gene were taken as MeSH 
keywords associated with each gene. For example the MeSH keywords associated with a gene “FOS” in our gene list are oncogene, felypressin, transcription-factor, thermoreceptors, DNA-binding, 
antibiosis, inflammatory-response, zinc-fingers, gene-regulation, and neuronal-plasticity.

GO keyword extraction
We used the GO keywords information incorporated in Gene Ontology [Error! Bookmark not defined.] to extract GO keywords associated with each gene. Out of the three GO annotation categories 
we included only molecular function and biological process as we believe that cellular component (e.g. nucleus, cell membrane etc.) is less important for characterizing genes in the context 
of this study. Further, due to the hierarchical nature of GO and multiple inheritance in the GO structure, we consider with every ancestor up to level 2 in the GO tree in assigning GO keywords. 
This enables us to use more generalized GO terms. For example the GO keywords associated with the gene “FOS” in our gene list are protein-dimerization, DNA binding, RNA polymerase, transcription 
factor, DNA methylation, inflammatory-response, and nucleus.

) (i = 1, 2,…n and j = 1, 2, … k) to represent the gene's characteristics in terms of the associated keywords. 
Common techniques for such numeric encoding includes (1) Binary, the presence or absence of a keyword relative to a gene, (2) Term frequency, he frequency of occurrence of a keyword with a gene (3) 
Term frequency × inverse document frequency (TF*IDF), the relative frequency of occurrence of a keyword with a gene compared to other genes.

specification of the desired number of clusters, k. This method clusters data into groups by iteratively optimizing the positions of cluster centers (means) so that the sum of within-cluster similarities 
(the similarity between data points and their cluster centers) is maximized.

). We used the following procedure to establish the corpus: (1)Determine randomly two cancer categories (brain tumor and breast cancer ), (2) For 
each cancer category, select randomly 10 genes from Entrez such that species = human and number of associated abstracts ≥ 50, (3)For each gene identified in this way, select randomly 10 abstracts, resulting in 
a total of 200 abstracts; 10 abstracts for each of the 10 genes associated with each of the two cancer categories, (4) For each of the 200 abstracts, identify manually the keywords characterizing biological 
function and processes from abstracts, MeSH terms and GO terms.
With this text corpus we were able to construct a matrix containing all 20 genes and their associated keywords and keyword frequencies from abstracts, MeSH terms and Go terms. The manually annotated corpus 
of 200 abstracts and the matrix of 20 annotated genes served as gold standard for our evaluation experiments. We carried our four evaluation experiments: (1) Abstract keywords (baseline). Extracts gene annotation 
terms based on term frequencies * inverse document frequencies (TF*IDF) within the entire abstract without regard to sentence structure, (2) Sentence keywords. Extracts gene annotation terms based sentence-level 
keywords, (3) Sentence + MeSH keywords. As in (2) above plus MeSH terms (see Section MeSH keywords extraction), (4) Sentence + MeSH + GO keywords. As in (2) above plus MeSH terms (see Section MeSH keywords 
extraction) and GO terms (see Section GO keyword extraction).

).
We notice that the baseline method comprising TF*IDF keywords fares worst among all four approaches. We interpret this as evidence for the validity of the methods involving sentence-level processing as this 
information is likely to carry most specific characterizing terms. The ‘brute-force’ abstract-level processing will have difficulty in extracting these terms correctly and consistently. We further notice that 
the substantial improvements of precision and recall when we include MeSH terms and GO terms. This may be because these two categories are more specific and MeSH and GO annotations were done using full-papers 
and these biological functions and process are not described in all abstracts.

sets of differentially expressed genes (p<0.05), namely, genes differentially expressed with response to EGF, G(EGF), genes differentially expressed with respect to S1P, G(S1P) and genes differently expressed in

, respectively. 
The clustograms depict associations between genes and biological function/process terms derived from the abstracts obtained with the various gene lists. For the investigating scientist, the clustograms fulfill the 
following main functions: (1) Squares highlighted in a horizontal line link a gene to one or more biological functions or processes. This is useful to see which genes are associated with which functions/processes and 
which genes have few or many associations. The interpretation of many and few is very much dependent on the associated biological function/process categories, the particular scientific question under investigation, 
and also on how extensively a particular gene has been researched and reported in the literature. (2) Users may visually delineate clusters, i.e., rectangular areas with many highlighted squares in them and few 
highlighted squares around them. Any cluster, small or large, is potentially very useful to have discovered. Each cluster identified in this way relates a set of genes to a group of biological functions and processes. 
In a sense, each gene in the clustered is characterized by the same set of biological function and process concepts, a kind of ‘guilt by association’. This information is extremely useful as it provides clues as to 
the roles genes may play collectively in pathways and functions, processes, and possible phenotypes, that are associated with these pathways.

data mining and knowledge discovery pipeline. Our evaluation suggests that this approach will provide more specific and useful information than typical approaches using abstract-level information. This is particularly 
the case when the sentence-level terms are augmented by MeSH and GO keywords. 


Conclusion
The sequencing of whole genomes and the introduction high throughput analysis (e.g., oligonucleotide and cDNA chips, MALDI/SELDI-TOF MS) provides biomedical research with a global perspective, which necessitates 
the development of novel mining tools to explore and interpret data in timely manner. This paper presents a novel approach to combine sentence-level keywords with GO and MeSH terms. In our evaluation experiment, this 
approach has shown promising results. The present evaluation suggests that this approach will provide more specific information than typical approaches using abstract-level information. This is particularly the case 
when the sentence-level terms are complemented by MeSH and GO terms. Further, clustering of genes into different functional groups based on literature keywords has the potential to help biologists identify and characterize 
literally informative genes of interest for further investigations.

Future work
Future enhancements of the system will include additional data resources (OMIM. DIP, KEGG) and the generation of association rules to identify correlations among genes in the same cluster. Association rules between 
the genes in the same cluster seem particularly interesting because it allows one to find the presence of regularities between gene groups. Finally, abstracts were used in this study as they are readily and easily available 
but they are limited in content. As full-text contains large number of irrelevent sentences compared to abstracts this approach may be useful for full-text analysis too, as it performs filtering of irrelevant sentences 
before clustering. The plan to perform the current study with full-text articles and compare the results with that of abstracts is on the way.
