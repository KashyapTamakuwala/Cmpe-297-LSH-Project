Objectives
The main objectives of this study were to establish expert validity (a convincing realistic representation of colonoscopy according to experts) and construct validity (the ability to discriminate between different levels of expertise) of the Simbionix GI Mentor II virtual reality (VR) simulator for colonoscopy tasks, and to assess the didactic value of the simulator, as judged by experts.

Methods
>
1,000 colonoscopies performed before). All participants filled out a questionnaire about previous experience in flexible endoscopy and appreciation of the realism of the colonoscopy simulations. The average time to reach the cecum was defined as one of the main test parameters as well as the number of times view of the lumen was lost.

 < 0.001). The group of expert endoscopists rated the colonoscopy simulation as 2.95 on a four-point scale for overall realism. Expert opinion was that the GI Mentor II simulator should be included in the training of novice endoscopists (3.51).

Conclusion
In this study we have demonstrated that the GI Mentor II simulator offers a convincing realistic representation of colonoscopy according to experts (expert validity) and that the simulator can discriminate between different levels of expertise (construct validity) in colonoscopy. According to experts the simulator should be implemented in the training programme of novice endoscopists.

], but the presented outcomes lacked power due to their relatively small sample sizes. In addition, some cases did not study the validity of endoscopy, but for example only the EndoBubble module, a computer simulation skills test measuring how long it takes a person to pop 20 balloons in a virtual tunnel.
Objective
The main objectives of this study were: (1) to establish the degree of representation of real-life colonoscopy on the Simbionix GI Mentor II VR colonoscopy simulation, as judged by experts (expert validity), (2) to determine whether the GI Mentor II simulator can distinguish between various degrees of expertise in endoscopy, judged by novice, intermediate experienced, experienced and expert endoscopists performing VR colonoscopy (construct validity), and (3) to assess the didactic value of the simulator, as judged by experts.

). The GI Mentor II can simulate upper GI tract endoscopies such as esophagogastroduodenoscopy, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatographies, and endoscopic ultrasound. The lower GI tract endoscopies it simulates are sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy. The simulator records a range of parameters upon each exercise, which can be used to assess performance objectively. The endoscope used is a customized Pentax ECS-3840F endoscope.

] varying from very unrealistic (1) to very realistic (4). Questions were asked about the realism of imaging, simulator setup, endoscope control and both haptic and visual feedback. Experts were asked whether the GI Mentor II could be used as a teaching device for novice endoscopists and whether experience on the simulator could be useful in practice.

Simulation modules
All participants first performed the hand–eye coordination task (EndoBubble level 1) of popping all 20 balloons in the test as quickly as possible, without touching the walls. Next, the participants performed VR case numbers 1 and 3, both from colonoscopy module 1. These cases were carefully selected for their discriminative value; both cases are straightforward colonoscopies, without any abnormalities such as polyps, tumours, or inflammation. Case number 1 is a relatively easy colonoscopy to perform, whereas case number 3 is more difficult, requiring the endoscopist to apply techniques such as straightening the endoscope during loop formation and applying torque to the endoscope shaft. The assignment given for the VR colonoscopies was to reach the cecum as quickly as possible with as little patient discomfort as possible. Patient discomfort was defined as the estimated percentage of time the virtual patient was in excessive pain and the number of times excessive local pressure was caused. Other relevant test parameters were the percentage of time spent with clear view and the number of times view of the lumen was lost. The task was considered accomplished when the cecum was reached.

Results
Participants
Thirty-five novices, 15 intermediates, 20 experienced, and 35 expert endoscopists participated in the study. The average number of colonoscopies performed annually by experts was 445, and their mean number of years registered as a gastroenterologist was 7.7 (range 0–35 years).

Mann–Whitney two-tailed test, exact significance




Expert validity
The group of expert endoscopists rated the colonoscopy simulation 2.95 on a four-point Likert scale for overall realism. Anatomical representation was rated 2.58, and the simulator setup 3.14. Endoscope control scored 3.21. Haptic feedback was rated 2.57.

Didactic value
Expert opinion was that the GI Mentor II simulator should be included in the training of novice endoscopists (3.51 on a four-point Likert scale) and that expertise gained on the simulator was considered applicable in a clinical curriculum (rated 3.29 out of 4). The simulator was not considered suitable for certification of trained endoscopists (rated 2.29 out of 4).

].
The colonoscopy tasks were considered as accomplished once the participants reached the cecum. Asking the participants to inspect the mucosa on the way back through the colon does not, in our opinion, provide a proper representation of the endoscopist’s skills in manoeuvring through the colon, as other aspects besides the basic navigation skills of the endoscopist could influence the performance parameters provided by the simulator considerably in this case. This might lead to very different end times depending, for example, on the carefulness of the endoscopist.
This study demonstrates that the GI Mentor II simulator offers a convincing, realistic representation of colonoscopy according to experts. The overall assessment was good. Expert opinion was that the simulator can be used as a teaching tool for novice endoscopists. The simulator’s haptic feedback is doubtful. Inexperienced residents can be trained in the skills necessary in flexible endoscopy such as steering control, straightening the endoscope during loop formation and applying torque up to a certain level.

Conclusion
The current study demonstrates that the GI Mentor II simulator offers a convincing, realistic representation of colonoscopy according to experts (expert validity) and that the simulator can discriminate up to the level of intermediate experienced endoscopists (construct validity) in colonoscopy. In the cases used the simulator could not discriminate between intermediate, experienced and expert endoscopists. The next step will be a study to determine whether novice endoscopists can develop a learning curve that will actually improve their endoscopic skills applied to real patients.
