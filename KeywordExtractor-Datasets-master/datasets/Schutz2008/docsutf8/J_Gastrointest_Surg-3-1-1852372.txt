Introduction
The aim of the study was to analyse pH- and bile-monitoring data in patients with Barrett’s esophagus and in age- and gender-matched controls.

Subjects and Methods
Twenty-four consecutive Barrett’s patients (8 females, 16 males, mean age 57 years), 21 patients with esophagitis (10 females, 11 males, mean age 58 years), and 19 healthy controls (8 females, 11 males, mean age 51 years), were included. Only patients underwent endoscopy with biopsy. All groups were investigated with manometry, gastric and esophageal 24-h pH, and simultaneous bile monitoring according to a standardized protocol. A bilirubin absorption >0.25 was determined as noxious bile reflux. The receiver operator characteristic (ROC) method was applied to determine the optimal cutoff value of pathologic bilirubin levels.

Results
p
p
 = 0.001. ROC analysis showed the optimal dividing value for patients at more than 1% bile reflux over 24 h (75% sensitivity, 84% specificity).

Conclusion
An optimal threshold to differentiate between normal and pathological bile reflux into the esophagus is 1% (24-h bile monitoring with an absorbance >0.25).

 using this technique. However, in these studies, the control patients were between 25 and 35 years old. In clinical practice, patients with Barrett’s mucosa tend to be older. In addition, the authors of each study used varying reference values to measure biliary reflux in the esophagus, making comparison of the measured values difficult.
The aim of the present study was to analyze data of pH and bile monitoring in a collective of healthy age- and gender-matched controls and patients with Barrett’s esophagus.

Subjects and Methods
Subjects
Selection of controls was carried out according to a strict protocol. Healthy volunteers treated from 1999 to 2000 between the ages of 40 and 60 years were included in the study. None of the controls were on acid suppressing or gut motility medications, had a history of upper gastrointestinal disease, had undergone upper or major abdominal surgery, or had had therapeutic endoscopic procedures of the upper gastrointestinal tract. Diagnostic endoscopy and barium swallows were not performed, but gallstone disease was excluded by ultrasound scan.
From 1999 to 2002, 24 patients with histologically confirmed Barrett’s mucosa were included in the study. For additional comparison, we include a group of patients with esophagitis (stage I to III according Savary and Miller) without Barrett’s esophagus, which had the same diagnostic procedures before planned laparoscopic fundoplication. During the aforementioned time span, 21 patients age older than 40 years were available for this study. Exclusion criteria were history of esophageal, gastric, or biliary surgery, history of abdominal or thoracic radiotherapy, or presence of peptic ulcer disease, active gastrointestinal bleeding, esophageal or fundic varices, esophageal or upper small intestine chronic disease, or neoplastic disease. All drugs potentially affecting gastrointestinal motility and secretion were discontinued at least 1 week before the study.

Upper Gastrointestinal Endoscopy
All patients underwent classical upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. If sedation was necessary, intravenous administration of propofol (up to 200 mg) was normally used, or occasionally, midazolam (up to 5 mg) was used. During endoscopy, the presence and extent of esophagitis, Barrett’s esophagus, and hiatal hernia was noted. Biopsies were taken from the Barrett’s mucosa.

Ambulatory Esophageal/Gastric pH and Bile Monitoring
All groups underwent esophageal manometry and 24-h pH and simultaneous bile monitoring using a standardized protocol. Ambulatory pH monitoring was performed using a transnasally inserted antimony pH electrode with a separate skin reference electrode (Synetics Medical, Stockholm, Sweden). The data were stored on a portable digital recorder (Digitrapper MkIII, Synectics Medical Stockholm, Sweden). Before each study, the pH probe was calibrated in buffer solutions of pH 7 and 1. An episode of acid reflux was defined as a decrease in esophageal pH to less than 4 for more than 10 s.

Figure 1

The simultaneous biliary and pH monitoring was done with administration of a colorless “white diet” (WD) including liquid and solid foods with a maximum in vitro bile absorbance of 0.25 [absorbance scale ranging from 0 (plain water) to 1 (total screen)]. The meals included water, milk, toast, potatoes, chicken, dry biscuits, and fish.

Data Acquisition and Interpretation
After completion of the measurements, probes were withdrawn from the patients, and data were stored via interface on an IBM-compatible computer equipped with Polygram® software (Medtronic). The data of each second of the 24-h measurements were used for analysis. To assess the presence of gastric or esophageal biliary reflux, the percentage of time when absorbance was greater than 0.25 was calculated for the following periods: total supine, upright, and postprandial. The postprandial period was defined as 2 h after the end of meals. The percentage of time with esophageal pH lower than 4 and median gastric pH and the percentage of time with gastric pH measuring 1, 2, 3–7, and >7 was also calculated for the above periods. The mean duration of the ambulatory pH and Bilitec monitoring study was 22 h, 40 min in patients and 23 h, 44 min in the controls.

Statistical Analysis
The SPSS (version 11.0, Chicago, Illinois) program was used to analyze the results. For graphical presentation, we used the program MedCalc for Windows, (Version 9.0, MedCalc Software, Belgium). Median, interquartile range (IQR or 25th to 75th percentile) values were established. The nonparametric tests (Mann–Whitney and Kruskal–Wallis analysis) were used to assess the relationship between variables. Box and Whisker plots were used to present some of the data. In these plots, the box represents the IQR, and the Whiskers represent the highest and lowest values. Outliers are also plotted, defined as more than 1.5 times the IQR from the 75th centile. Extreme values were defined as more than three times the IQR from the 75th centile.
18
 The area under the curve (AUC) as a measurement of diagnostic performance of the test was used. The results are given as point with the 95% confidence interval (95% CI) and graphically for presentation of all data. As the positive group, we used the patients with Barrett’s mucosa, and the negative test group was defined by the healthy volunteers. A nonparametric distribution of the area under the curve was assumpted.
The assumptions for calculation of the required sample size were alpha = 0.05, beta = 0.80, and that a test is only valid for daily use if less than 20% of the healthy controls and at least 80% of the patients have positive test results. The calculated sample size for each group was 20.

Ethics
The study protocol was approved by the ethics committee of the University of Cologne. Each subject gave written informed consent.

Discussion
The results of our study confirm that patients with Barrett’s esophagus have significantly more frequent duodenogastric reflux into the esophagus than age- and sex-matched healthy controls. In addition, this reflux, measured by acid and bilirubin exposure, remains longer in the esophagus, especially during sleep.

In our study, the control group of patients with different grades of esophagitis showed no significantly different measurements of acidic or bile reflux into the stomach or the esophagus compared to Barrett’s patients. This may be caused by selection of patients with esophagitis, which were candidates for fundoplication, but both groups of patients differed significantly compared to healthy controls. Therefore, our results are of great clinical relevance especially for preoperative diagnostic.
22
 In this study, the average age of the control patients was 25 years, and that of the patients in Groups I, II, and III was 42, 50, and 60 years, respectively. The bilitec-probe was positioned 10 cm below the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). The threshold of bilirubin absorbance was 0.14, and although no difference was found between groups over the TMT, gastric bilirubin exposure was higher in the supine than in the upright position. In the current study, the control group was older than that of the Marshall study. More duodeno-gastric reflux was recorded in both study and control patients during all periods of measurement. These findings may be due to improved study conditions.

 in an in vitro study of absorption of different white meals, showed that the least food interference during bile monitoring was measured with an absorbance > 0.25.
23
 They compared two groups of young controls. The subjects took either liquid meals only, not absorbing light of the same wavelength as bilirubin, or solid food, avoiding diets that interfere with bilirubin absorbance. The authors found significant differences between the two groups using a bilirubin absorbance threshold >0.14 with a median percentage (interquartile range) over the TMT of 10.9 % (6.7–19.3) for solid meals and 0.3% (0.0–2.8) for liquid meals. Major meal artifacts were present in two-solid-meal (10%) and no-liquid-meal subjects. In our study, we found such a meal artifact in one patient and one control, but the values of bilirubin absorbance were lower than 0.25, and therefore, not relevant to our results.

 Possibly, these phenomena are caused by relaxations which occur more often in older people. In contrast, nearly all patients with Barrett’s esophagus (87%) and all patients with esophagitis (100%) showed pathologic acidic reflux and/or bile reflux measured with combined pH and bile monitoring. Bile reflux into the esophagus during sleep, in particular, was only found in patients with BM or with esophagitis.
25
27
 The precise mechanism by which nocturnal DGR occurs and the roles posture plays remain unclear.
16
 This is understandable, as the amount of reflux into the stomach (DGR) does not necessarily correlate with DGER into the esophagus. In this study, the authors demonstrated more DGR in females during the supine period, while males presented more DGER. At the same time, there was no correlation between bile levels in the stomach and esophagus. The controls were, however, much younger than the patients. We found significant differences in bile measurements of the stomach and esophagus between BM patients and controls. In contrast to Bowrey et al., we saw more DGER in females during the supine period and more DGR in male patients.

29
 studied esophageal bile and acid reflux in patients with long segment Barrett’s esophagus (LSBE), short segment Barrett’s esophagus (SSBE) and patients with gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD). Subjects underwent esophageal manometry and simultaneous 24-h pH and bile monitoring (Bilitec 2000) with an absorbance value >0.2 for 10.9% of the total period. GER did not differ between the groups. However, DGER differed between patients with LSBE (14.7%), SSBE (2.1%), and GERD (2.1%).
Although about 30% of the healthy controls showed acid reflux in pH monitoring, patients with BM had significantly more acid reflux during all measured periods.

Healthy controls did not have relevant duodeno-gastric-esophageal reflux measured by bilirubin absorbance. Especially during the supine period, there was no bile reflux.

The optimal threshold for pathological bile reflux is 1.1 % (bile monitoring with an absorbance of 0.25).
