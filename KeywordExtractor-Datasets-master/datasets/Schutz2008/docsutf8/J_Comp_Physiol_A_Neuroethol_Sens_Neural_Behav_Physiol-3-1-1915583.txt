However, such an approach requires detailed knowledge about the responses of the involved receptors, information that is almost completely lacking.

). During the rearing period larvae were fed ad libitum. For the electrophysiological experiments. 1- to 4-day-old fifth instars were used that were starved for 2–3 h. In feeding experiments the caterpillars were used during the whole duration of the fifth stadium. Between feeding experiments, caterpillars were kept at 4°C.

Morphology
The morphology of the palps was studied using scanning EM. Fixation and drying often induce shrinking and cause collapse of soft tissue parts. We avoided these problems by using Cryo-SEM. Larvae were used directly after moulting into the fifth stadium. The preparation was stabilized by quick immersion in nitrogen slush (60 K), coated with a 200 Å thick layer of gold and viewed in the frozen state using a Philips 535 SEM equipped with a Hexland CT1000/CP2000 and a Jeol 35C SEM equipped with an EMSCOPE SP2000A cryo preparation assembly.

All stimuli were applied in random order with at least 30 s between them. Longer intervals were used after strong stimuli. Preparations were discarded after 60 min and were changed after a successful recording. Odour stimuli were stored at 4°C between recording sessions, and replaced every few days.
The AC amplified action potentials from the sensory cells were recorded on tape (Racal FM taperecorder). To facilitate computer-assisted analysis, the valve signal and a pre-pulse 1 s earlier were recorded on an additional channel.

Analysis of recordings

). Spikes were characterized primarily by amplitude. Amplitude boundaries for different cells were taken from an amplitude versus time plot. The separation of the cells is an interactive process in which spike amplitude and spike interval distributions are used as criteria to judge the separation. After the separation, responses for each cell were calculated as the difference in action potential frequency in the last second before the onset of stimulation and the first reaction second. A cell was assumed to respond to a stimulus if an increase of at least ten spikes could be evoked. Cells with weaker reactions were assumed to be sensitive to untested stimuli and were not further analysed. To test the significance of observed differences in spike frequency, analysis of variance was used on log transformed response data.

Usually 1 or 2 h after the start of the experiment, caterpillars started eating. The experiment was terminated after at least two third of the insects had been eating for more than 3 h.

Although the sensitivity to benzaldehyde was often associated with that for the leaf alcohols, examples of both benzaldehyde insensitive cells (cell 14–15) and apparent benzaldehyde specialists (cells 18–19) were found.

 is clear that although at least two groups of cells with comparable spectral responses can be distinguished (cells 1–5, cells 6–19), however, there are no sharp boundaries between these classes (cf. cell 5), and considerable variation does exist. Since care was taken to record only from cells that were reliable and reproducibly responding, it is likely that this variation does reflect natural variability in the receptor cell population. The separation in aldehyde- and alcohol sensitive cells should therefore at present merely be considered as a convenient way to summarise the data. Until more recordings are made, it cannot be excluded that a continuum from more specialised to, more generalised cells exists.

It will be interesting to investigate the actual genetics underlying the observed sensitivity differences between the species.
