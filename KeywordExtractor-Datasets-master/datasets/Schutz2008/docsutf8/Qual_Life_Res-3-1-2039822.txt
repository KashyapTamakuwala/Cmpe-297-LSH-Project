 < 0.003) for generic and disease-specific questionnaires. Effect sizes were somewhat higher for disease-specific compared to generic questionnaires (0.55–0.95 versus 0.32–0.60) except for the TAIQOL subscales, which showed very poor sensitivity to change. Anchor-based methods resulted in a somewhat larger range of estimates of MCID than distribution-based methods. Combining distribution-based and anchor-based methods resulted in similar ranges for the minimally clinical important differences for generic and disease-specific questionnaires: 2–15 points on a 0–100 scale. Apart from the generic TAIQOL subscales, both generic and disease-specific questionnaires used in this study showed good psychometric qualities and responsiveness for use in clinical studies on children with rAOM.

The current RCT on the effectiveness of pneumococcal vaccination in children with rAOM will address both the issues of using generic versus disease-specific questionnaires and responsiveness in evaluating treatment effects on HRQoL in RCTs. The results will lead to recommendations regarding the applicability of these questionnaires in clinical studies in children with rAOM.

Methods
Setting and procedure
FHS and HRQoL were assessed in 383 children with rAOM participating in a double-blind randomized, placebo-controlled trial on the effectiveness of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination versus control hepatitis vaccination. The study was conducted at the paediatric outpatient departments of a general hospital (Spaarne Hospital Haarlem) and a tertiary care hospital (University Medical Center Utrecht). Children were recruited for this trial through referral by general practitioners, paediatricians, or otolaryngologists, or were enrolled on the caregiver’s own initiative from April 1998 to February 2001.

Study population
Inclusion criteria: children were aged between 12 and 84 months and suffering from rAOM at study entry; defined in this study as having had at least 2 episodes of physician diagnosed AOM in the year prior to study entry. Exclusion criteria were conditions with a known increased risk for AOM such as: known immunodeficiency (other than IgA or IgG2 subclass deficiency), cystic fibrosis, immotile cilia syndrome, cleft palate, chromosomal abnormalities (like Down syndrome) or severe adverse events upon vaccination in the past.
At each scheduled visit, two research physicians (C.N.M.B. and R.H.V.) collected data regarding the number of episodes of AOM (based on parental report at baseline and on physician report during follow-up), upper respiratory tract infections, and pneumonia. Information about the medical treatment, and ear, nose, and throat surgery in the preceding 6 months was also collected. The primary caregivers completed questionnaires assessing FHS and HRQoL of their child and family during the clinic visits at baseline and at 7, 14, and 26 months follow-up. Caregivers were requested to have the same person complete the questionnaires each time and to rate their child’s FHS and HRQoL with regard to their recurrent episodes of acute otitis media. Informed consent was obtained from caregivers of all children before study entry. Medical ethics committees of both participating hospitals approved the study protocol.

]. For this reason, from July 1999 the TAIQOL was added to the previously selected set of questionnaires. Although the full, original version of the TAIQOL has been applied during the study, only those subscales from the TAIQOL are discussed that, based on their content, were assumed to be sensitive to the consequences of AOM. The following subscales tap functional items that are often affected by AOM (OM-related): ‘Sleeping’, ‘Appetite’, ‘Liveliness’, ‘Problem behaviour’, ‘Positive mood’, and ‘Communication’ (items about speech and language capacity) which are 6 of the 12 subscales in the TAIQOL. Although the TAIQOL has been developed for children aged up to 5 years, we also used the questionnaire in children aged 6–7 years, as no appropriate alternative was available during the study.

A panel of paediatric otorhinolaryngologists and paediatricians from our study sites selected the items most relevant according to their clinical experience. The FFQ is composed of six questions covering effects of the child’s rAOM on caregiver and family activities and two questions assessing these effects on emotional behaviour of the other siblings. The Likert-scale was used as a response format and was analogous to that of the RAND and OM-6 in our study, ranging from score 1–4.

]: RAND, FSQ Generic and Specific, OM-6, NRS Child, FFQ, TAIQOL, OMFSQ, NRS Caregiver. For all questionnaires higher scores indicate the presence of a better HRQoL or FHS. To allow comparisons between scores on the questionnaires, all scores were linearly transformed into 0–100 Scales. For each questionnaire, the evaluation period was the 6 weeks before completion.

Statistical analyses
Floor and ceiling effects
Floor and ceiling effects were estimated for the baseline-assessment of each questionnaire by calculating percentages of respondents that had minimum and maximum scores, respectively. Questionnaires should exhibit minimal floor and ceiling effects to be optimally able to detect difference and change.


Reliability

The time frame for completion was 2 weeks after the first set of questionnaires was filled out during the outpatient visit at 14 months (first test). Children with AOM at the first test were excluded, since differences in their scores could be due to real change and interfere with the assessment of reliability.

Additionally, correlations between questionnaire scores and frequency of physician visits for upper respiratory tract infections as well as frequency of AOM episodes in the preceding 6 months were calculated.

Responsiveness
74
], the intervention could not be used as an external criterion of change. Data of both vaccine groups were pooled instead for the assessment of responsiveness to spontaneous remission. The clinical experience of a panel of 5 experts in the field of otitis media, formed the basis for defining a reduction of 2 or more episodes of AOM per child per year as the external criterion for change while a reduction of 1 episode or less identified no change. Responsiveness was evaluated for two intervals: from 0 to 7 months and from 7 to 14 months follow-up. The observed change in these episodes was multiplied by 12/7 (1,714) to get the estimated change per year.

] for changed subjects. In this statistic, the observed change that occurred in changed subjects is related to the observed random change or random error, in unchanged subjects. A parametric effect size was computed as: mean change score changed group/SD (change score unchanged group); a nonparametric effect size was computed as: median change score changed group/interquartile range (change score unchanged group)).
79
], an effect size of 0.2 represents a small change, 0.5 a moderate change and 0.8 or higher represents a large change. For skewed distributions Wilcoxon matched pairs test was used to calculate the significance of change.


Clinical relevance of change scores

]. The MCID can be computed from both distribution-based and anchor-based methods. Several estimates of the MCID from both methods are reported, to assess the likely range of the MCID for each questionnaire.

]. The 1-SEM of a questionnaire links reliability of an instrument to the variance of scores in a population as reflected in its formula: 1-SEM = SD (change scores unchanged subjects) * √(1-ICC). It is an estimate of what part of the observed change may be due to random measurement error by including distribution of scores (SD) and instrument reliability (ICC). Change larger than the SEM therefore is considered ‘real’ change. The SEM is here used as an estimate of the MCID (SEM-MCID). The ES-MCID and SEM-MCID support the interpretation of measured change, as they reflect the smallest change that is substantially larger than the random variability in the study population which is based on the standard deviation of the unchanged subjects.

Interpretation of change—anchor-based methods

]. The OM-FSQ was used as an anchor for responsiveness. It consists of three questions assessing clinical AOM severity: earache, sleeping problems, and other signs and symptoms (irritability, fussiness, fever) that may indicate the presence of an ear infection. In our population, the OM-FSQ demonstrated high internal consistency (Cronbach’s α = 0.88) and good test–retest reliability (ICC = 0.94). The OM-FSQ correlated weakly with the NRS Child (Spearman’s rho = 0.18), but moderately with the RAND (0.36), FSQ Generic (0.37), and NRS Caregiver (0.34), and strongly with the FSQ Specific (0.52), OM-6 (0.73) and FFQ (0.61).
52
], the OM-FSQ total score was about 62 on a scale of 0–100 during an episode of AOM, increasing to 92 at 6 weeks and to 90 at 12 weeks after an episode of AOM with higher scores reflecting less severe ear-related symptoms. Therefore, a score change of 10–20 on the 0–100 scale of the OM-FSQ in the current population was considered to be a small clinically relevant change in AOM severity, a score change of 30–50 as moderate to large. Anchor-based estimates of the MCID were computed as the change in questionnaire scores associated with small changes in AOM frequency and OM-FSQ.
For all analyses the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 10.1 was used.

The effect sizes for the generic FHS questionnaires ranged from small to moderate (0.29–0.60). For the generic TAIQOL subscales however, the effect sizes were lower, ranging from almost zero for the subscales ‘Appetite’ (0,0), ‘Problem behaviour’ (0.02) and ‘Positive mood’ (0.06) to small for ‘Sleeping’(0.37) and ‘Liveliness’ (0.22). Effect sizes for the disease-specific questionnaires were moderate to large (0.55–0.95). For the questionnaires the ES were quite similar for the first (0–7 months) and second intervals (7–14 months), whereas for the second interval absolute change scores were smaller.
The TAIQOL was excluded from further analyses on the interpretation of change, due to its poor sensitivity to change.

], the choice for any external criterion for change remains somewhat arbitrary. It is a surrogate measure that often only reflects one aspect of the QoL construct. The poor responsiveness of the TAIQOL subscales ‘Behavioural problems’, ‘Positive mood’ and ‘Liveliness’, for example, may indicate that our clinical indicator is less suitable as external criterion for change in emotional and behavioural functioning. However, considering the overall poor responsiveness of the twelve TAIQOL subscales (results not shown), it seems more obvious that poor responsiveness in itself mainly applies for these three subscales as well.

]. By applying and comparing multiple methods as well as two evaluation periods, we have not only been able to demonstrate consistency in responsiveness but also to give ranges for minimally clinical important changes instead of point-estimates. As there is no ‘golden standard’ for the assessment of responsiveness in FHS and HRQoL measurement, a range of scores gives a more realistic reflection of responsiveness than a point-estimate. Point estimates can be misapplied by users who are either unaware of the limited precision of data used for estimating the MCID or who are unaware of the intrinsic limitations of dichotomising what is actually a continuum.

Possibly, this higher sensitivity at the start of the study reflects the higher incidence of symptoms and functional limitations that are specific to AOM, whereas during the study AOM incidence decreases and consequently AOM symptoms become less prominent compared to other health problems. Overall, the generic questionnaires appeared to be as sensitive to clinical change as disease-specific questionnaires, except for the TAIQOL.

).
The reasons for the poor performance of the TAIQOL with regard to both discriminant validity and sensitivity to change are not obvious. Possibly the subscale scores represent each an aspect of HRQoL that is too limited to be sensitive to differences or change. Combining the subscales to more comprehensive constructs may then improve sensitivity. In addition, each item of the TAIQOL consists of two questions; a question about FHS is followed by the request to rate the child’s well-being in relation to this health status. Response shift bias may have modified the caregivers’ expectations about how their child feels in line with the child’s changing health, that is caregivers may rate their child’s well-being as better than it actually is as they adapt to the situation. Studies on factors that may influence sensitivity to change or responsiveness besides the type of questionnaire (generic versus disease-specific), such as questionnaire structure and content, disease severity, co-morbidity and other population characteristics, are needed.

Bias and generalisibility
100
], resulting in the underestimation of HRQoL change scores because they may have evaluated the situation as worse than it objectively was in the first place. However, if such a recall-bias regarding AOM frequency was in fact present, it may also have influenced caregivers’ reflection on subjective measures such as FHS and HRQoL, which results in realistic or even overestimated change scores. However, estimating responsiveness for the interval of 7–14 months, in which AOM frequency was not affected by recall bias since al episodes were physician diagnosed, yielded similar results. This indicates that recall bias appears not to have influenced responsiveness substantially.
Secondly, in assessing test–retest reliability, two different modes of questionnaire administration were used: completion at the clinic versus home completion. The possible intention to give more socially desirable answers at the clinic as well as other effects such as being more distracted when filling in the questionnaires at home, may have caused differences in questionnaire scores between the first (test) and second (retest) assessment. Although this impact may be larger for single item questionnaires such as the NRSs compared to multiple item questionnaires, and might explain their somewhat smaller ICCs, the impact on the ICCs appears to be small.
Thirdly, during the trial, 8 children (4.2%) in the pneumococcal vaccine group and 13 (6.7%) in the control vaccine group were lost to follow-up. One child switched from the control to the pneumococcal vaccine group. It is unlikely that these small numbers of dropouts and crossovers influenced the trial results.
Furthermore, indices of validity and reliability are not fixed characteristics of FHS and HRQoL questionnaires but are influenced by the study design, intervention, and study population in particular. Our study population had significantly severe ear disease with frequent episodes and was older than the average child with AOM. Assessment of reliability and validity of the questionnaires in populations with less severe disease may present more ceiling effects and lack of discriminant validity. Therefore, the results of this study should only be generalized to paediatric populations with moderately to seriously severe recurrent acute ear-infections at an older age (approximately 14–54 months).
31
], we do not support this approach. It is suggested that routine use of these questionnaires would facilitate detection and discussion of psychological issues and help guide decisions regarding, for example, referral. However, considering the complexity and many pitfalls of reproducibility and responsiveness assessment, individual use of HRQoL and FHS questionnaires as part of the follow-up of individuals is not reliable nor valid.

Recommendations for clinical use
In conclusion, generic (RAND, FSQ Generic and FSQ Specific) as well as disease-specific (OM-6, FFQ, and, to a lesser extent, NRS Caregiver) questionnaires demonstrated similar and high reliability and adequate construct and discriminant validity as well as responsiveness to justify use in clinical studies of children with rAOM. However, NRS as used in this study may be less adequate for assessment of HRQoL in this population. The TAIQOL, the only true generic HRQoL questionnaire, unfortunately showed a poor discriminant validity and sensitivity to change, needing extensive revision before further use in clinical outcome studies in children with otitis media. Using both a generic questionnaire (RAND or FSQ) and the OM-6 in clinical studies regarding FHS in children with rAOM is recommended, as it would combine the merits of both generalisability and sensitivity in outcome assessment and facilitate head-to-head comparisons of their performance in various paediatric populations with OM.
More studies are needed assessing responsiveness of paediatric QoL questionnaires by multiple, distribution as well as anchor-based, methods to increase our appreciation of minimal clinically important changes in various paediatric conditions. Further studies on factors such as questionnaire structure and content, disease severity, co-morbidity and other population characteristics that may influence sensitivity to change or responsiveness besides the type of questionnaire (generic versus disease-specific) may increase our appreciation of the complex dynamics in HRQoL and FHS assessment.
