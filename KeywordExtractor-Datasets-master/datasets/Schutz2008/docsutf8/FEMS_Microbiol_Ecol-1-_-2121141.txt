Environmental microbiology is undergoing a dramatic revolution due to the increasing accumulation of biological information and contextual environmental parameters. This will not only enable a better identification of diversity patterns, but will also shed more light on the associated environmental conditions, spatial locations, and seasonal fluctuations, which could explain such patterns. Complex ecological questions may now be addressed using multivariate statistical analyses, which represent a vast potential of techniques that are still underexploited. Here, well-established exploratory and hypothesis-driven approaches are reviewed, so as to foster their addition to the microbial ecologist toolbox. Because such tools aim at reducing data set complexity, at identifying major patterns and putative causal factors, they will certainly find many applications in microbial ecology.

However, the point of the table was both to identify some general trends in the literature and to give one example of the usefulness of multivariate analysis to analyze a data table.

In the first part, data type and preparation are reviewed as a necessary basis for subsequent multivariate analyses. Second, common multivariate methods (i.e. cluster analysis, principal component analysis, correspondence analysis, multidimensional scaling) and a few statistical methods to test for significant differences between groups or clusters are described, focusing on the methods' main objectives, applications, and limitations. Beyond the mere identification of diversity patterns, microbial ecologists may wish to correlate or explain those patterns using measured environmental parameters, and this approach is addressed in the third part. Special emphasis is placed on a few methods that have proven useful in ecological studies, namely redundancy analysis, CCA, linear discriminant analysis, as well as variation partitioning. The final part provides practical considerations to help researchers avoid pitfalls and choose the most appropriate methods.

Data types and data preparation
Data sets
a priori
a priori
 dependent on those made on another object. Variables, however, can be found to be intercorrelated to various degrees, but this is not necessarily known in advance. Initial data sets can also consist of distance matrices where pairwise dissimilarities between objects are calculated. The original table of raw data is not always available, e.g. for DNA–DNA hybridization values, phylogenetic distances, and thus specific multivariate techniques have to be considered to deal with data matrices.

Data transformations
In multivariate data tables, measured variables can be binary, quantitative, qualitative, rank-ordered, classes, frequencies, or even a mixture of those types. If variables do not have a uniform scale (e.g. environmental parameters measured in different units or scales) or an adequate format, variables have to be transformed before performing further analyses. Each qualitative variable has to be recoded as a set of numerical variables that replace it in the numerical calculations. One way to do so is to create a series of ‘dummy’ variables that correspond to all the states of the qualitative variable. For instance, if the variable ‘season’ has to be recoded, four associated variables will be constructed, and for each object the value 1 will be given to the corresponding season when it occurs, and 0 for the three other seasons when it is absent. Many statistical packages automatically perform this recoding.
Standardization
z
-score transformation to the values of each variable. For each variable, it consists of (1) computing the difference between the original value and the mean of the variable (i.e. centering) and of (2) dividing this difference by the SD of the variable.

Briefly, one can either delete rows or columns containing the missing value(s), or try to replace the missing values by mathematical estimates inferred from values obtained from other objects in the data set. In the latter case, it is still difficult to provide ecologically meaningful explanations for these estimates. In any case, the specific handling of missing data should be reported by the investigator.

Exploratory analyses
Visualization and exploration of complex data sets
The basic aim of ordination and cluster analysis is to represent the (dis)similarity between objects (e.g. samples, sites) based on values of multiple variables (columns) associated with them, so that similar objects are depicted near from each other and dissimilar objects are found further apart from each other. Exploratory multivariate analyses are thus useful to reveal patterns in large data sets, but they do not directly explain why those patterns exist. This latter point is addressed in the third part of the review.

Indeed, for correlation matrices, variables are first standardized (i.e. they become independent of their original scales), and so distances between objects are also independent from the scales of the original variables. All variables thus contribute to the same extent to the ordination of objects, regardless of their original variance.

). Projecting an object at a right angle on a species arrow in the ordination diagram approximates the position of the object along that species descriptor. The length of the species descriptor indicates its contribution to the formation of the ordination space. For correlation biplots, the length of the orthogonal projection of a species arrow on the axes approximates its SD on the respective axes. Angles between species arrows reflect their correlations, e.g. putative interactions between species (scaling 2). An erroneous interpretation of the biplot would be to use the proximity of an object point and the tip of a species arrow to deduce a relationship between them. Indeed, only right-angle projections of samples onto species arrows are correct to derive approximated species abundance in the samples.

Objects are represented as points in the ordination space. Eigenvalues are also used here to measure how much variance is accounted for by the largest synthetic variables on each PCoA synthetic axis. Although there is no direct, linear relationship between the components and the original variables, it is still possible to correlate object scores on the main axis (or axes) with the original variables to assess their contribution to the ordination.

It is important to remember that in such joint plots, either distances between sample points or distances between species points can be interpreted, but not the distances between sample and species points. Indeed, these distances are not simple Euclidean distances computed from the relative row or column frequencies, but rather they are weighted distances. The proximity between sample and species points in the plot can thus be understood as a probability of species occurrence or of a high abundance in the samples in the vicinity of a species point.

In NMDS ordination, the proximity between objects corresponds to their similarity, but the ordination distances do not correspond to the original distances among objects. Because NMDS preserves the order of objects, NMDS ordination axes can be freely rescaled, rotated, or inverted, as needed for a better visualization or interpretation. Because of the iterative procedure, NMDS is more computer intensive than eigenanalyses such as PCoA, PCA, or CA. However, constant improvement in computing power makes this limitation less of a problem for small- to medium-sized matrices.

Environmental interpretation
Exploratory analyses may reveal the existence of clusters or groups of objects in a data set. When a supplementary table or matrix of environmental variables is available for those objects, it is then possible to examine whether the observed patterns are related to environmental gradients. Typical objectives may be, for instance, to reveal the existence of a relationship between community structure and habitat heterogeneity, between community structure and spatial distance, or to identify the main variables affecting bacterial communities when a large set of environmental variables has been conjointly collected.

Rao, 1964
). Two tables are then necessary: one for the species data (‘dependent’ variables) and one for the environmental variables (‘independent’ variables). Multiple linear regressions are used to ‘explain’ variation between independent and dependent variables, and these calculations are performed within the iterative procedure to find the best ordination of the objects. The interest of such an approach is to represent not only the main patterns of species variation as much as they can be explained by the measured environmental variables but also to display correlation coefficients between each species and each environmental variable in the data set.

The large rectangle represents the total variation in the biological data table, which is partitioned among two sets of explanatory variables (a, b). Fraction 4 shows the unexplained part of the biological variation. Fractions 1 and 3 are obtained by partial constrained ordination or partial regression, and can be tested for significance. For instance, fraction 1 corresponds to the amount of biological variation that can be exclusively explained by (a) effects when (b) effects are taken into consideration (i.e., when b is considered as a covariable). Fraction 2 [i.e., variation indifferently attributed to (a) and (b) or a covariation of (a) and (b)] is obtained by subtracting fractions 1 and 3 from the total explained variance, and cannot be tested for statistical significance.

Selection of variables in regression models
Legendre & Legendre, 1998
). In order to only include in the model the environmental variables that mostly and significantly contribute to the variation of the species table, automatic selection procedures (forward selection, backward elimination, or stepwise selection) are often used. The selection depends on whether the partial correlation coefficients of the variables fall below a given significance level, the latter being generally assessed by Monte Carlo permutation tests.
In forward selection, the construction of the regression model starts with the variable that explains the most variation in the dependent variables (generally the species table). What remains of the biological variation to explain after fitting the first environmental variable (i.e. of the residual variation) is then used to choose the second environmental variable. The process of selection goes on until no more variables significantly explain the residual variation. In backward elimination, the construction of the regression model starts with all environmental variables and the least significant ones are excluded from the model, one at a time until a group of only ‘significant’ variables is obtained. To take advantage of the two approaches, stepwise regression mixes forward selection with backward elimination by performing a forward selection, but excluding the variables that no longer become significant after the introduction of new variables into the regression model.

Legendre & Legendre, 1998
). For instance, if a matrix of molecular data is available for a set of strains and their habitat of origin is known, it is possible to determine whether the genetic distances are related to habitat type using the (goodness-of-fit) Mantel test. The matrix representing the ecological hypotheses should then consist of a series of 1 and 0 for isolates found in the same or different habitats, respectively. The Mantel test can thus determine whether the posited habitat distribution can significantly explain the structure of the molecular matrix. This test cannot be used, however, to test a hypothesis matrix that would be based on the results of a cluster analysis, for instance. Indeed, as indicated in ‘Testing for significant differences between groups,’ there would be a lack of independence between the hypothesis being tested and the data used to test the hypothesis.

Fig. 4
Relationships between numerical methods. Exploratory tools such as PCA, CA, PCoA, NMDS, or cluster analysis can be applied to a sample-by-species table to extract the main patterns of variation, to identify groups or clusters of samples, or specific species interactions. Sample scores on the main axes of variation can be related to variation in environmental variables using indirect gradient analyses. When a constrained analysis is desired (i.e. direct gradient analysis), RDA, db-RDA, CCA, or linear discriminant analysis can be used as extensions of the unconstrained methods. Mantel tests are appropriate to test the significance of the correlation between two distance matrices (e.g. one based on species data and the other on environmental variables). Raw data may be transformed, normalised or standardised as appropriate before analysis.



Data type is also another important criterion. To represent absolute abundance values, linear-based methods (PCA, RDA), which produce weighted summations, are appropriate, whereas unimodal techniques (CCA, CA) are rather used to model relative abundances (because species scores are weighted averages of the samples scores, and vice versa), i.e. they model the dissimilarities between samples (β diversity). They also accommodate well the presence of many zeros in the species table, in contrast to linear-based methods for which double zeros lead to inadequate estimates of sample distances.
Legendre & Legendre, 1998
). NMDS and PCoA can be compared using Shepard diagrams to decide which technique better represents the original distances.
If one assumes that species do not have a linear response to environmental gradients, NMDS is more appropriate than PCA. CA may also be an alternative to PCA when many zeros populate the data set and one strong gradient is present. With long ecological gradients, however, CA may produce the arch effect that can be corrected for using DCA. In terms of the underlying species model, the main difference between DCA and NMDS is that the former is based on a specific model of species distributions (unimodal model), while NMDS is not. Thus, DCA may be favored by ecologists who assume that the niche theory better fits their data set, while NMDS may be a method of choice if species composition is determined by factors other than position along a gradient (for instance if the habitat is known to be fragmented).

Ordination and diversity indices
Whittaker, 1972
Hartman & Widmer (2006)
 did not find significant changes in soil bacterial communities submitted to various soil managements when using diversity indices, while community structures were shown to have changed using community fingerprinting analysis.
et al
., 2003
). These strategies attribute specific weights to the species data so that simple or constrained ordinations of the new species table represent the total inertia as α and β diversity, and would thus be consistent with the measures obtained by common diversity indices.

Misconceptions about multivariate analyses
James & McCulloch, 1990
). One should thus not overinterpret the data by relying on unjustified causality, especially in the absence of real experimentation. In theory, it would be necessary to validate the inferences and models made about pattern formation and putative causes by analyzing new data, but this is rarely performed in practice. Moreover, whether the originally collected data are typical of the situation to be described is most of the time not even questioned.
Another common misconception is that multivariate analyses alone can sort out all solutions of complex multivariate studies. Although exploratory analyses may help reveal interesting patterns in data sets, the interpretation and explanation of the observations ultimately rely on the researcher's hypotheses and previous knowledge of the ecological situation. Microbial ecologists themselves need to formulate ecologically sound hypotheses and test them.


Conclusions
Exciting questions in Ecology typically consist of determining whether community patterns are structured across space or time, of explaining how those patterns can be related to environmental heterogeneity, and of quantifying how much still remains unexplained when all significant, measured variables have been considered. Such questions can now start to be addressed in microbial ecology because numerical tools may help explore and test such ecological hypotheses. These are indeed exciting times because even larger and more complex databases are being created and in parallel, computing power gradually becomes less of an issue. If microbial ecologists want to test numerical methods, develop new ecological theories, or validate existing ones for the microbial case, access to diversity data and above all, to the relevant associated environmental parameters, becomes a central issue. It would thus be of great interest to make such complex data sets publicly available, such as microbial ecological databases, so that microbial diversity can be studied in its environmental context. This would indeed be a step toward making microbial ecology a central discipline in Ecology.
