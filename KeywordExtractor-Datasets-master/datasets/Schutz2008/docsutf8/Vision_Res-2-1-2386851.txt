Abstract
Psychological Review, 68
, 301–340] proposed that the variance of visual signals increased with their means. However, both a low threshold and intrinsic uncertainty produce similar relationships. I measured the relationship between first- and second-response accuracies for suprathreshold contrast discrimination, which is thought to be unaffected by sensory thresholds and intrinsic uncertainty. The results are consistent with a slowly increasing variance.

, for a graphical demonstration of this). Thus, to some degree, intrinsic uncertainty mimics Swets et al.’s proposal of increasing variance. With suprathreshold stimuli, the maximum activity always occurs in the appropriately tuned mechanism, and the others have no influence on perception.

1.4
Low-threshold theory
Swets et al. (1961)
Solomon, 2007
), I have corroborated this claim, and shown that the fit is not quite as good as those produced by models including either intrinsic uncertainty or increasing variance.

1.5
This study
Pelli, 1985; Tanner, 1961
Swets et al.’s (1961)
 low-threshold theory requires sensation variance to increase with sensation mean. These theories are somewhat special because they are thought to affect the visibility of only very faint stimuli. Increasing variance, on the other hand, has implications for suprathreshold contrast discrimination. For this reason, I decided to conduct a 2R4AFC contrast-discrimination experiment. The goal was to obtain an estimate of the sigma-to-mean ratio, which would not be contaminated by intrinsic uncertainty or a low threshold.

Methods
There were five observers: the author (JAS), another psychophysicist who understood the purposes of the experiment (MJM), two experienced psychophysical observers who were naïve to the purposes of this experiment (FV and MT) and one further observer who had no previous laboratory experience (NN). As described below, NN produced a very high proportion of “finger errors.” This suggested to us a general unreliability, and no further analyses were performed on his data.

).
On each trial, three stimuli appeared with a pedestal contrast, which varied between blocks of 90 trials each. The contrast of the fourth stimulus was somewhat greater. After each 0.18-s stimulus exposure, observers gave two responses. The first response indicated which of the four positions the observer thought most likely to have contained the high-contrast target. The second responses from JAS and MJM indicated their second choices for the target position. Following their second responses, JAS and MJM received auditory feedback indicating which—if either—of their responses was correct.
The naïve observers were not told that three of the four stimuli would have the same contrast. They were instructed merely to indicate their choices for the positions containing the two highest contrasts, in order. This encouraged them to fully consider their second responses, even when they felt confident about their first. The naïve observers received no feedback.

Threshold-vs.-contrast functions (first response only)
Fig. 2
 shows how threshold varies with pedestal contrast. JAS’s and MJM’s thresholds were similar, and formed the classic “dipper” shaped function. MT did not suffer as much masking. That is, his thresholds with high-contrast pedestals were lower than the JAS’s and MJM’s. However, his detection threshold—obtained with pedestals having zero contrast (or −∞ dB)—was similar: between −24 and −23 dB. FV’s thresholds with high-contrast pedestals fall within the range spanned by the other observers’, thus we can be reasonably confident that these pedestals exceeded her detection threshold, as they did for the other observers.

For legibility, I have decided to combine data from increments producing similar first-response accuracies, as determined by the psychometric functions described above. I have adopted the relatively arbitrary decision to use 5 dB bin-widths. There is one visible consequence of this manipulation: a rightward shift for one data point in JAS’s panel. However, without binning, the suprathreshold data presented below would be impossible to read.

Discussion
The most equitable summary of these results is that they are consistent with a performance-limiting source of noise, which increases slightly with suprathreshold contrast.
Kontsevich et al., 2002
Solomon, 2007

Foley, 1994

4.2
Sensory thresholds for contrast discrimination
Swets et al., 1961
Swets, 1961
). However, it is no less valid to apply the concept to the task of contrast discrimination, even with large pedestals. That is, forced-choice errors may occur simply because all the alternatives appear identical and the observer simply guesses incorrectly.
Fig. 5
Swets et al.’s (1961)
 detection data (not shown). However, some proportion of correct second responses may indeed have been just lucky guesses, which is to say my data cannot rule out a “low threshold” for “suprathreshold” contrast discrimination.

4.3
Other models
Foley (1994)
Foley and Boynton (1994)
 were able to probe the interactions between mechanisms responsible for contrast discrimination. However, when no masks are present, most models (including all of Foley’s) consider contrast discrimination to be mediated by a single mechanism or channel; the one best tuned to the target.
Teo and Heeger (1994)
Yu, Klein, and Levi (2004)
Watson & Solomon, 1997b
) I have argued this type of model is well approximated by the more popular, single-mechanism model for contrast discrimination. The two types of model can be considered equivalent when performance-limiting noise is added after the outputs of multiple mechanisms are combined.
Henning and Wichmann (2007)
Fig. 2
Blackwell (1998)
 argued that noise, both within the detector’s pass band and outside it, could reduce intrinsic uncertainty and facilitate detection. She also provided psychophysical evidence for this facilitation.

When those others have sufficient “pedestal” contrast for essentially perfect detection, neither intrinsic uncertainty nor a sensory threshold can contaminate an observer’s decision as to which of the four is most intense. For JAS and MJM, all of the black spots disappeared during each 0.18-s stimulus exposure. For the other observers, only the central fixation spot disappeared.
