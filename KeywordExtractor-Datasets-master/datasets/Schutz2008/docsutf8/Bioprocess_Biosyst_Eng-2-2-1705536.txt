 could be achieved. In batch cultivations the generated rTfH is translocated to the periplasm wherefrom it is completely released into the extracellular medium. In fed-batch runs most of the produced rTfH remains as soluble protein in the cytoplasm and only a fraction of about 35% is translocated to the periplasm. Migration of periplasmic proteins in the medium is obviously coupled with growth rate and this final transport step possibly plays an important role in product localization and efficacy of the Sec translocation process.

A-secretion signal under the control of a thermo-inducible promoter. This strategy should enable translocation of the gene product by the Sec-transport system from the cytoplasm into the periplasmic space, where the properly folded TfH should accumulate after cleavage of the OmpA sequence. Several cultivation strategies and purification routes were considered. The aim of the investigations was to provide sufficient amounts of TfH for larger-scale polyester degradation studies (low purification grade) and a highly purified TfH for mechanistic studies and structural analysis.

 evolution. The rise in rTfH activity cannot solely originate from translocation but suggest additional secretion from cytoplasm. Apparently expression of rTfH is faster than its transport through the cytoplasmic membrane in the early phase shortly after induction. In shake-flask cultivation, the rTfH production was monitored in the cytoplasm as soluble and insoluble cytoplasmic fractions (iCFs; data not shown). Maximum hydrolase activity was achieved after about 7.5 h summing up all compartments. Subsequently, the total hydrolase activity was slightly decreased, and finally rTfH was only detected in the supernatant.

 indicates that the further protein bands observed for each media differ only in their intensity but not in their composition. This suggests that protein release in the medium cannot be attributed to cell lysis but is mainly due to an increasing leakage of proteins located and transported to the periplasm from the cytoplasm by the Sec-transport system.

This view is supported by the simple recovery route to give a crude and stable rTfH preparation, which did not exhibit activity losses after storage at −20°C for several weeks.

 tag and the full or truncated OmpA leader sequence on TfH activity can hardly be estimated from the results of this study. However, the high activities of rTfH obtained suggest that small sequences at the C- and N- terminals might have little effect on TfH activity. The fraction of soluble active protein located in the cytoplasm is remarkably high but its amount can be estimated to be less than 2% of the total protein content of the cells (assuming 50% protein of DCW). Therefore, it is understood that inclusion body formation could not be detected.

 but to their respective actual volumes. If it is assumed that the volume of periplasm is about 5% of the cell volume then the rTfH concentration in the periplasm is more than tenfold higher than in the cytoplasm. This might explain that no cytoplasmic rTfH activity was found in the batch runs, where the periplasmic protein was entirely released in the extracellular space. In contrast, relatively little protein was transported across the outer cell wall into the medium in the fed-batch runs with high cell densities and higher rTfH activities were found in both the cytoplasm and periplasm.

 section) immediate activity was observed. This suggests that either folding takes place spontaneously in the PBS buffer or the cytosol already harbours the active folded rTfH and its translocation follows another mechanism. Unfortunately, our study does not allow to distinguish between the two possibilities.

. These authors reported that the proteins found extracellularly are of periplasmic origin except the heat-shock protein DnaK. Various and interrelated stress factors in the temperature-induced HCDC are suggested to be responsible for the migration of periplasmic proteins in the extracellular medium.
In all cultivations performed in this study, rTfH could be detected in the medium without applying any additional measures to permeabilize the outer cell membrane. Cell lysis as a possible mechanism of rTfH release can be excluded as the cleavage of the OmpA sequence in the extracellularly found hydrolase indicates transport across the cytoplasmic membrane by the Sec-translocation mechanism. Any significant cell lysis would also release cytoplasmic rTfH still containing the complete signal sequence.

 generation. This points to the increased maintenance and ATP demand for translocation of the heterologous gene product (rTfH) across the inner cell membrane.
These mechanisms, which govern the local distribution of rTfH are not yet understood. Though cell-specific productivities are in a comparable range, product distributions differ largely. Our results suggest that the outer membrane permeability is related with the growth rate and hence all rTfH can migrate into the extracellular medium at high growth rates (batch runs). Therefore, final product release across the cell envelope could play an important role in the overall translocation process as product accumulation in the periplasm seemingly reduces the translocation rate from the cytoplasm by the Sec pathway. This hypothesis requires further investigations, which are presently in preparation. Therefrom, new strategies for cultivation and downstream processing with improved product qualities are expected.
