 LAEF as a characteristic of LA systolic function is increased in NCCM patients compared to normal individuals. These results can suggest compensating left atrial work against the dysfunctional LV in NCCM patients.

]. The objective of the present study was to assess LAEF in NCCM patients using RT3DE and to compare to control subjects.

Methods
Patient populations
The study comprised 17 patients with an established diagnosis of NCCM and their results were compared to 17 healthy age-matched controls with no evidence of cardiovascular disease. All patients and control subjects were in sinus rhytm and all of them were examined by two-dimensional echocardiography (2DE) and RT3DE.

Diagnostic criteria for NCCM

]: (1) absence of coexisting cardiac anomalies, (2) segmental, excessive thickening of the LV wall with a two-layered structure: a thin, compacted epicardial layer and a much thicker, noncompacted layer with the characteristic appearance of numerous, prominent trabeculations (meshwork) and deep intertrabecular recesses, (3) colour Doppler evidence of deeply perfused intertrabecular recesses, and (4) predominant localization of thickening in the LV apical, midlateral, and midinferior walls. Hypertensive heart disease was excluded by clinical and echocardiographic examinations (septal thickness < 13 mm).

Limitations

]. The concentric LV pattern was associated with the greatest LA volumes and with the strongest LAEF, suggesting that chronic pressure overload more than volume overload stimulates the LA in increasing its workload. Left atrial dilation can be resulted from chronic mitral regurgitation, which can also affect LA systolic function. Another important limitation is that left atrial contraction produces both the forward blood flow toward the LV through the mitral valve and backward flow towards the pulmonary veins. Unfortunately, only the forward blood flow was examined during the present study.

Conclusions
LAEF is increased in NCCM patients compared to normal individuals. These results can suggest compensating left atrial work against the dysfunctional LV in NCCM patients. However, further studies are warranted evaluating LA function by RT3DE in patients with different stages of NCCM.
