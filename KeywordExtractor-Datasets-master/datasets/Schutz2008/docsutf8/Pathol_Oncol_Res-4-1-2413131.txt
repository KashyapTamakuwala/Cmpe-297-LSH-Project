Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is involved in multiple aspects of cancer cell biology. EGFR has already been identified as an important target for cancer therapy, with various kinds of EGFR inhibitors currently used in treatment of several human cancers. Recently, EGFR and its downstream signaling pathways were identified as being associated with cisplatin sensitivity. In addition, EGFR inhibitors have shown significant promise for patients who failed cisplatin-based therapy. In this study, we investigated whether treatment with an EGFR inhibitor improves cisplatin sensitivity in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cell lines. The effects of a combination of AG1478, a specific EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, with cisplatin were evaluated in cultured OSCC cell lines and cisplatin-resistant sublines. Higher expression of EGFR and p-EGFR was found in the two cisplatin-resistant cell lines compared with the corresponding parental cell lines. In addition, augmented inhibition of OSCC cell growth by the combination of AG1478 with cisplatin was found in both cell lines. These results suggest that the combination of an EGFR inhibitor and cisplatin may be useful as a rational strategy for the treatment of patients with oral cancer with acquired cisplatin resistance.

In this study, we established a cisplatin-resistant cell line from an OCSS-derived cell line and investigated the differential EGFR and phosphorylated EGFR (p-EGFR) expression between OSCC cell lines and the cisplatin-resistant sublines. In addition, we examined the effect of combination therapy with an EGFR inhibitor and cisplatin on the growth of OSCC cells.

], the cisplatin (CDDP)-resistant sublines H-1/CDDP and Sa-3/CDDP were established by repeated subculture in the presence of increasing concentrations of cisplatin (Nippon Kayaku Corporation, Tokyo, Japan), from 0.1 μg/ml until cells became fully resistant to cisplatin and could grow exponentially; in each case the final cisplatin concentration was 0.5 μg/ml. The drug-resistant cell lines were passed in drug-free medium, and there was no loss of resistance during the two-month testing period.

Western Blot Analysis
Subconfluent cells were scraped from culture dishes, washed twice with phosphate buffered saline (PBS), and suspended in 700 μl Western blot lysis buffer containing 62.5 mM Tris–HCl (ph 6.8), 25% glycerol, and 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). Samples were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 20 min at 4°C, after which supernatants were collected. After heating at 95°C for 5 min, equal amounts of proteins were separated with the use of 10% SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to a PVDF membrane in Tris-glycine buffer containing 20% methanol. The membrane was blocked with 3% skim milk containing 0.01% polyoxyethlene sorbitan monolaurate for 60 min, and incubated overnight with the corresponding primary antibodies {a 1:750 dilution of anti-rabbit polyclonal EGFR antibody [Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA], and a 1:750 dilution of anti-goat polyclonal p-EGFR (Tyr 1173) antibody [Santa Cruz Biotechnology]} at 4°C. The membrane was washed three times for 5 min each with PBS containing 0.05% polyoxyethlene sorbitan monolaurate and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-goat antibody for 1 h at room temperature, respectively. Protein signals were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence using ECL Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham, Arlington Heights, IL, USA) for 1 min and exposed to Kodak Biomax XAR film.

]. In our study, the combination of AG1478 and cisplatin showed augmented effects of inhibition in both cell lines and showed large-effect augmentation in cisplatin-resistant cell lines. These results suggest that acquired resistance to cisplatin is associated with enhanced sensitivity to an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, which correlates with increased EGFR and p-EGFR expression.
Augmented effects of inhibition of OSCC cell growth through the combination of AG1478 and cisplatin provide a potential and novel strategy for patients with oral cancer with acquired cisplatin resistance. In addition, it would be very advantageous if an equal chemotherapeutic effect could be obtained with a smaller dosage of cisplatin. The combination of AG1478 and cisplatin against OSCC definitely deserves additional in vivo and clinical studies.
