 promoter approximately 9 kb upstream of transcriptional initiation. We have identified two small elements, which can confer endodermal expression on a reporter gene in the early embryo. We have analysed one of these in detail and show that its activity depends on co-operating VegT and Sox17-binding sites, whereas the other regulatory region responds to Activin.

The reaction typically contained 150–200 ng of linearised plasmid DNA and 0.5 μl of a 1:200 dilution of restriction enzyme (2 units/ml). Injections of dejellied unfertilised eggs were performed in 6% Ficoll, 0.4× Marc's modified Ringer (MMR) or 0.4× MBS in polyheme-coated plastic dishes. Correctly cleaving eggs were sorted at the 2- to 4-cell stage and incubated in 6% Ficoll, 0.1× modified Barth's medium. GFP fluorescence was monitored using a Leica MZFLIII dissecting microscope.

Thus, in the context of the sequences studied, the E-element is the only region both necessary and sufficient to direct expression in the progenitor of the endoderm and in the early gastrula.

A shows that B1 is much more active in the vegetal than the animal hemisphere, in agreement with the transgenics. This is also true, to a reduced degree, of the C3B1 combined fragment. Surprisingly, C3 showed reduced expression in the vegetal relative to the animal hemispheres. This may partly be because these results are expressed as a ratio of animal to vegetal expression. High expression in the animal hemisphere was also seen in GFP transgenics where we simply scored for vegetal expression. Presumably inhibitory elements are lacking.

). The C3B1 fragment produced an intermediate result. Thus B1, but not C3, responds positively to VegT and the responses of B1 and C3 to VegT mirror their activity in vegetal versus animal poles.

 alone is expressed ectopically, it slowly induces the co-operating factors needed for auto-induction, eventually establishing a partial endodermal gene network. Normally the cooperating molecules are maternal or are induced by VegT. In contrast to B1, C3 did not respond to Xsox17, as expected from its lack of consensus Sox sites.

 promoter.
Activity of the C3 endodermal element
Chen et al., 1997; Germain et al., 2000
). However, Activin induces the expression of many downstream molecules, which could then be responsible for indirect induction of this element. To prove the effect was direct we showed that C3 is stimulated by activated Smad2 in the oocyte. This indicates a direct effect, since the single nucleus of this cell has 10,000-fold less transcriptional capacity to induce downstream effectors of Activin/Smad action than does the early gastrula.

 through the same promoter elements.
C3 responds strongly to Activin, but with respect to vegetal expression and response to VegT, its behaviour is paradoxical. It is surprising that it does not respond to VegT in the embryo, both because C3 contains a consensus T-box core sequence and because VegT induces the expression of TGF-βs that, like Activin, act through Smads 2/3; indeed VegT depends on this signalling for its overall biological effect. The T-box site in C3 entirely overlaps a Fast1/Smad pair of sites, which may have a bearing on the fact that VegT actually inhibits C3 basal expression, just as its expression is inhibited in the vegetal pole compared to the animal. This is consistent with the observation that removal of the T-box site removes the inhibition (data not shown). C3 was identified by its ability to direct expression in the vegetal pole of transgenics, however here we simply scored expression in the vegetal pole itself, disregarding animal regions. Conversely, the luciferase measurements are of the ratio either of vegetal to animal expression or of VegT stimulated to control expression in the animal region. Therefore a high level of animal expression would mask vegetal activity of the promoter. However, it is important to note that both the VegT induction and vegetal expression are consistent. We believe that the response to TGF-βs is the important property of C3 and other problems are introduced by looking at small regulatory regions in isolation, where synergising and inhibitory effects are absent.

 signal dependent in the establishment phase of endoderm development.

The activity of the B1 endodermal element
The activity of B1 is more straightforward. It is highly expressed in the presumptive endoderm in transgenics and it is much more highly expressed in the vegetal than the animal hemisphere in transient assays. It is also strongly stimulated by VegT. It contains a divergent T-box site which binds VegT in vitro and which mutation shows is partially responsible for the VegT stimulation in the embryo. Expression in oocytes shows that B1 responds directly to VegT through this site, although the stimulation is less than in embryos. This correlates with the fact that blocking TGF-β signalling in embryos with a truncated Activin receptor reduces VegT stimulation to about the oocyte level. Thus B1 responds directly to VegT and synergistically to other molecules that are downstream of the VegT-induced TGF-βs, which would principally be Nodal-related signals. These synergistic molecules are the Xsox17 proteins themselves in an autoregulatory loop.

 expression (as shown by Sox site mutants and blocking Xsox17 action with combined Xsox17 group morpholinos), it seems that VegT is able to co-operate with Xsox17 to produce more rapid Sox action.
The kinetics of reporter expression suggest that the VegT and the T-box site are not simply needed at the very onset of endodermal gene expression in the initiation phase, but that this continues into gastrulation during the establishment phase. It is provocative that the Sox site of principal importance in B1 is very near to the VegT site, suggesting a direct interaction between VegT and Xsox17, although we have been unable to detect this by immunological co-precipitation.

 found that the number of possible stable states of gene networks depended only on the number of autoregulated components. Since it is reasonable to equate stable states with differentiated states, the autoregulation of a key endodermal transcription factor would be most significant in endodermal differentiation.

 transcripts for comparison. The blastopore lip is marked by an arrowhead in panels A–F. At stage 12, the endogenous gene is expressed as in panel G, and the MR21 GFP is shown in panel H. A minimal promoter, with only 260 bp of 5′ sequence is not expressed in the vegetal region (I), but it is expressed elsewhere. (J) MR21 is expressed throughout the endoderm at tailbud stages, just like the endogenous gene, as shown in an in situ hybridisation (K). The arrowheads mark the blastopore.

. The endodermal element is marked and fragments giving vegetal expression in the early gastrula are colored red. Below is GFP expression in various transgenics, with the corresponding expression panels indicated on the left of the constructs. (A, D, G, J, K) are stage 10.5; (B, E, H) are stage 12; (C, F, I, L) are tailbud stages. (A–C) Construct − 12Δ10-5 is negative in early endoderm. (D–F) Positive construct − 10; the embryo in (D) is a hemi-transgenic, providing a good control for the background fluorescence; the insert panel is the animal pole at the same exposure. (G–H) Positive construct − 10.5Δ7.7-5. (I) Construct − 5.7 is positive in the later foregut, as well as in the axis, like other 5′ constructs; (J) − 9.5Δ8.4-1.7 is positive in the involuting and non-involuting endoderm, whereas − 7.5 is not (K), but it gives low-level expression in the posterior endoderm of the tailbud (L). In panel J, the main tissues of the early gastrula are marked: end, endoderm; ect, ectoderm; ee, the extra-blastoporal endoderm, which involutes over the blastopore.

 mRNA. The third B1 panel shows a cleared embryo, with GFP expression in the deep involuting endoderm and also the extra-blastoporal, epithelial, involuting endoderm, enlarged in the fourth panel. The arrow indicates the blastopore lip. (D) Electrophoretic mobility shift analysis of B1 T-box motif. EMSA assays were conducted with the variant VegT-binding sequence in B1, with a mutant of it and with the consensus sequence in the Derrière gene. In each case, the reactions were performed with or without competitor (±).

 directly, via the T-box half site in B1, as well as nodal-related proteins (red). However, the Xsox17 induction becomes inhibited by a VegT-derived inhibitor. The inhibition is over-ridden by TGFβ signals, induced by VegT. This may simply be by the positive induction of C3 via FoxH1/Smad sites (green). Xsox17 autoregulates itself synergistically through Sox binding sites (blue) and the adjacent T-box half site (red). In addition, these Sox sites might respond to repressive members of the Sox family, restricting expression to the vegetal pole.
