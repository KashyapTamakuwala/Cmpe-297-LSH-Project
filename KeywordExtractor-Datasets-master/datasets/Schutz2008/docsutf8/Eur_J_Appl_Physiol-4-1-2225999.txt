-amylase suggesting a higher sympathetic tone during satiety. Furthermore, heart rate variability was associated with age and waist-to-hip ratio and cortisol levels negatively correlated with body mass index. Finally, neither chewing nor swallowing contributed to a heart rate increase at food consumption, but orosensory stimulation, as tested with modified sham feeding, caused a partial increase of heart rate. In conclusion, after meal ingestion critical physiological alterations reveal a elevated sympathetic tone, which is a potential measure of satiety.

). Finally, chewing, swallowing, and orosensory stimulation by food in a modified sham-feeding model were examined for a possible contribution to HR alterations.

Methods
Healthy subjects, 9 males and 9 females, aged between 23 and 63 years (average 42.9 years) participated in this study. Smokers and subjects with prescribed medication, except for contraceptives, and excessive weight loss during the last 3 months were excluded from participating in this study. The subjects were paid for their involvement and informed consent was obtained according to the guidelines of the Ethical Committee of Wageningen UR. Weight, height, and waist and hip circumferences, were measured while subjects wore light indoor clothing with emptied pockets and no shoes. To estimate body weight, 1 kg was subtracted from clothed body weight. Body mass index (BMI) was the weight divided by height squared. Waist circumference was measured at the level midway between the lower rib margin and the iliac crest, with participants in a standing position and breathing out gently. Hip circumference was measured at the level of the widest circumference over the greater trochanters. The waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) was calculated as waist circumference divided by hip circumference.

Discussion
Sensory ratings scales for satiety, desire to eat, fullness, and hunger were used in combination with measures to assess the relevance and temporal pattern of responses reflecting the sympathetic–parasympathetic (SNS–PNS) balance in relation to perceived satiety in humans.

Physiological responses reflecting the SNS–PNS balance were simultaneous to altered patterns of perceived satiety. In this food-related context, these ANS characteristics not only provide additional insights into the integration of central and peripheral regulatory processes for metabolism, but also render a potential measure of satiety in humans.

). This satiety cascade takes into account properties of food, physiological processing of nutrients that contribute to overall control of food intake, and also conceptualises differences between immediate postingestive effects and those produced later. The digestive period is divided into three to four phases depending on the site at which food acts to stimulate neural and endocrine organs, i.e. the cephalic and orosensory, gastric, and intestinal phases, which are sequential and follow on the progression of a meal.
