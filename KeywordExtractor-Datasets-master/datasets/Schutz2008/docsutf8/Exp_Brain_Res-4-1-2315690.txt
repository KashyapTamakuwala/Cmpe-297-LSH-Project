In the present study we investigated eye–hand coordination in adolescents with hemiparetic cerebral palsy (CP) and neurologically healthy controls. Using an object prehension and transport task, we addressed two hypotheses, motivated by the question whether early brain damage and the ensuing limitations of motor activity lead to general and/or effector-specific effects in visuomotor control of manual actions. We hypothesized that individuals with hemiparetic CP would more closely visually monitor actions with their affected hand, compared to both their less affected hand and to control participants without a sensorimotor impairment. A second, more speculative hypothesis was that, in relation to previously established deficits in prospective action control in individuals with hemiparetic CP, gaze patterns might be less anticipatory in general, also during actions performed with the less affected hand. Analysis of the gaze and hand movement data revealed the increased visual monitoring of participants with CP when using their affected hand at the beginning as well as during object transport. In contrast, no general deficit in anticipatory gaze control in the participants with hemiparetic CP could be observed. Collectively, these findings are the first to directly show that individuals with hemiparetic CP adapt eye–hand coordination to the specific constraints of the moving limb, presumably to compensate for sensorimotor deficits.

) investigated visuo-proprioceptive integration in adolescents with CP. Comparing arm postures in a bimanual position-matching task under different conditions of sensory feedback, he found that, in contrast to adult controls, participants with CP employed very similar end postures (joint angle configurations) with the left and right arm in conditions in which vision of one or both arms was prevented. This was interpreted as evidence that they relied more strongly on purely proprioceptive information rather than on a shared visuospatial-proprioceptive representation and that the encoding of visual and proprioceptive information into a common egocentric frame may be problematic in these individuals. This would suggest that individuals with CP more strongly depend on continuous visual feedback for guiding manual actions to visual targets, compared to neurologically healthy adults.

In the present study, we examined eye–hand coordination in an unconstrained object prehension task in individuals with hemiparetic CP and neurologically healthy controls. To manipulate task difficulty, an obstacle was present in half of the trials, inducing a more complex transport trajectory. Participants performed the task with each hand separately. Based on the registration of eye and hand movements, we calculated several measures of temporal and spatial aspects of eye–hand coordination. Besides giving a first descriptive account of gaze patterns during object manipulation in a population with congenital hemiparesis, we addressed two hypotheses. Our first and main research question concerned the way in which individuals with hemiparetic CP adapt eye–hand coordination to the sensorimotor impairments of their affected hand. We hypothesized that individuals with CP would use increased visual monitoring when they perform the task with their AH as compared to performance with the LAH and to performance of control participants. Second, we examined eye–hand coordination when the task was performed with the LAH in participants with CP. Based on the previously established deficits in action planning, we hypothesized that gaze patterns are less anticipatory in general, in individuals with CP. Given the limited knowledge on visumotor control in CP and on the role of eye-movements for action planning, this second research question was much more exploratory than the first.

Methods
Participants
1971
) University students (9 females, 20–25 years). The six participants of the experimental group (5 females, 14–19 years) were students at the Werkenrode Institute (Groesbeek, The Netherlands), where they followed an adapted educational programme. They had been asked to take part in the study based on their condition (viz. congenital spastic hemiparesis). Additional requirements were no known oculomotor disturbance (such as nystagmus), and having the motor, cognitive and attentional capacities to perform the experimental task as assessed by initial screening. All were able to walk and sit independently, and able to read and write with their LAH.

For each participant, the experiment consisted of eight conditions in a 2 × 2 × 2 factorial design, with the factors hand (AH/LAH for the participants with CP, NPH/PH for controls), obstacle (present, absent) and side (blue, green). In each of these conditions, five trials were performed, yielding a total of 40 trials per subject. The factors hand and obstacle were blocked while side was randomized within blocks. The order of the blocks was partially counterbalanced between participants. Prior to each trial, the participant was instructed to rest the “inactive” hand in his/her lap, such that it did not interfere with the task.

After placing the object on the target region, the participant moved his/her hand back to the starting position and the experimenter put the cylinder back to its original location. When a trial failed, for instance because the cylinder slipped out of the participant’s hand, it was immediately repeated. This never occurred more than twice in a single participant.

Gaze data were partially interpolated (up to four successive samples, corresponding to 8 ms, using cubic spline interpolation) and low-pass filtered (third order Butterworth with cut-off frequency of 20 Hz). Subsequently, gaze velocity, acceleration, and jerk (second time differential of velocity) were computed by repeated 3-point numeric differentiation.

Data reduction
Hand movements
Hand movements were identified using an absolute velocity threshold (0.20 m/s) and a direction criterion (start of a new movement indicated by a reversal of horizontal direction). These criteria provided the algorithms for the semi-automatic custom-written selection routines for the segmentation of the trials. Based on this segmentation, the grasp time (interval between the hand reaching and leaving the object region) and hand movement duration (interval between the hand leaving the object and reaching the target region) were determined. Analysis of eye–hand coordination was confined to the object transport phase that is from onset of the hand movement away from the object region till the end, reaching the target region. The duration of this movement was determined.

, for similar analaysis). Saccade termination was determined as the first moment after saccade onset at which velocity dropped below 50°/s. The total number of saccades registered in the experiment was 4,613. Saccade initiation/termination time was determined when none of the first or last eight samples (16 ms) were missing. Saccade peak velocity was determined, when in addition no more than four samples were missing in a row throughout the entire saccade. According to these criteria, saccade initiation and termination time could not be determined in 5.5% of all saccades, and peak velocity could not be determined in 10.5% of all saccades.

Subsequently, for each trial the “object-leaving” and the “target-reaching” saccade were determined (in many trials these saccades coincided since there was a single gaze shift from object to target). Automatic detection of these saccades was complicated by the fact that precision of gaze data was not sufficient for a procedure based on landmark regions around object and target. Therefore, the following semi-automatic two-step procedure was adopted. First, fixations to object and target were determined automatically, assuming that these occurred before (up to −600 ms) the beginning and at the end of object transport. Fixation periods were defined as intervals of at least 200 ms, during which, the standard deviation of absolute gaze fixation was smaller than 5 mm. Note that this automatic procedure did not use absolute landmark regions but relative position information—this was possible because the object and target were placed at the lateral extremes of the working region of the experiment. For the obstacle, an analogous procedure was not possible.
Choices of this first step were inspected trial by trial and manually corrected if necessary. Obstacle fixations were not taken into account since it was not always possible to reliably distinguish them from other, frequently occurring intermediate fixations between object and target. Second, an automatic routine was used to detect the object-leaving saccade, defined as the first saccade, at the end of which, gaze had moved more than 10° horizontally relative to the object fixation. Based on an analogous 10° criterion, the target-reaching saccade was determined at the end of object transport. Thus, small (<10°) corrective saccades at the end of object transport were ignored in the definition of the target-reaching saccade.

Eye–hand coordination
Visual monitoring during object transport was quantified by the number of intermediate fixations, that is, the number of gaze shifts minus one occurring between the object-leaving and the target-reaching saccade. Note that this number does not include potential small corrective saccades at the end of object transport, since the target-reaching saccade was defined as the last saccade of horizontal amplitude >10° reaching the target region.

Discussion
The main question we pursued in the present study was whether and in which way individuals with hemiparetic CP adapt eye–hand coordination to their sensorimotor impairments, in particular, when actions are performed with the affected hand (AH). We hypothesized that participants with CP would more closely monitor actions performed with their AH, compared to actions performed with their less affected hand (LAH) and compared to neurologically healthy control participants using either hand. Qualitatively, eye–hand coordination patterns were similar among control participants and participants with CP, regardless of the hand used to perform the task. That is, anticipatory saccadic gaze shifts were used to fixate future “action sites”—such as object, target, or intermediate fixations—in advance. Notwithstanding these qualitative resemblances, a more fine-grained analysis of temporal and spatial aspects of eye–hand coordination did confirm our hypothesis of increased visual monitoring when moving with the AH. Depending on the measure employed, this effect was present when comparing performance with the AH to control participants using either hand (increased number of intermediate fixations), or in addition for comparing performance with the AH to performance with the LAH in participants with CP (delayed gaze departure from object and hand, i.e., a longer MOA).
2003
), we decided to normalize our measures of temporal eye–hand coordination in order to exclude any potential confounding effects of hand kinematics. This normalization may be considered rather conservative. Without normalizing, the effects of task and participant group on MOA may have even been stronger.

In particular, the null-findings on anticipatory control and the comparison of individuals with left and right hemiparesis should be considered preliminary and require further investigation. On the other hand, the fact that we did find significant effects with respect to online visual control (number of intermediate fixations and MOA) despite the small number of participants suggests that the observed effects are robust.
