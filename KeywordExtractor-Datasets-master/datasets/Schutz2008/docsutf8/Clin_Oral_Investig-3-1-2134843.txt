 < 0.001). In sites with greater bone loss and infrabony defects, a poorer response was observed regarding RAL-V gain or PPD reduction, respectively. The conclusions of the study are the following: (1) Nonsurgical and surgical periodontal therapies are effective in single-rooted teeth; (2) severe interproximal bone loss and infrabony defects deteriorate clinical results; and (3) there seem to be more defect-associated (tooth, site) factors influencing treatment outcome than patient-associated factors.

]. Furcation involvement is a known factor to influence treatment outcome of nonsurgical and surgical therapy. To provide a high level of reproducibility of clinical measurements and to exclude a already known influencing factor, only single-rooted teeth were considered in this study.
The hypothesis behind this study is that different tooth-related factors (e.g., tooth type, site, plaque, residual inflammation, horizontal/vertical bone loss) and patient-related factors (e.g., age, sex, diagnosis, smoking) determine the initial outcome of nonsurgical and surgical periodontal therapy in single-rooted teeth.
Thus, the aim of the present study was to identify patient and site factors that determine the initial outcome of nonsurgical and surgical periodontal therapy in single-rooted teeth using more recent statistical methods.

Aggressive periodontitis: Patient is clinically healthy; that is, systemic diseases predisposing for periodontitis are not known; radiographic bone loss greater than or equal to 50% in at least two different teeth and age less that or equal to 35 years at time of diagnosis.

Radiographic examination and evaluation
Before therapy, in 36 patients, full-mouth sets of periapical radiographs (Ektaspeed plus; Kodac, Rochester, NY) were obtained in XCP technique (XCP, Kentzler & Kaschner Dental, Ellwangen/Jagst, Germany). Intraoral size 0 (maxillary second incisors and mandibular anteriors) and 2 (all other regions) dental films were exposed to an X-ray source (Heliodent DS®, 60 kV, 7 mA, Sirona, Bensheim, Germany) and developed under standardized conditions (XR 24 Nova®, Dürr Dental, Bietigheim–Bissingen, Germany).

]. This ruler consisted of six straight lines that divert in the same angle. For each site, the basic line of the Schei ruler was placed to the cementoenamel junction (CEJ) of the respective tooth parallel to the occlusal plane. Then, the ruler was moved until the sixth line was placed tangentially to the apex. Finally, the alveolar crest was located. Location between the two coronal lines meant bone loss up to 20% of root length. Location between the second and third line meant between 20 and 40% bone loss and so forth. If the CEJ was destroyed or overlapped by interproximal restorations, the restoration margin was used as reference. If the alveolar crest could not be determined because of overlapping of adjacent teeth, the interproximal site was classified as “cannot be assessed.” If an interproximal surface showed a double contour, this was classified as an interproximal root groove. All radiographic assessments were performed by an examiner who was blinded to the clinical measurements and therapy assignments (Schenk).

Statistical analysis
Data handling
All data were entered into a personal computer program (Systat™ for Windows version 10, Systat, Evanston, IL; Schenk). Descriptive statistics were then calculated using another program (SPSS™, version 10.0.1, SPSS, Chicago IL) by an independent statistician (Lungeanu). Multilevel analyses were modeled by another independent statistician (Reitmeir) using a third program (SAS® version 6.12, SAS Institute, Cary, NC).

Treatment comparison
The individual patient was considered as a statistical unit in this analysis. The main outcome variable for the comparison of the therapeutic effects of no further therapy, SRP, or AF was chosen to be the change of PPD. RAL-V was considered as a secondary endpoint. All other clinical parameters (GI, PlI) were control variables.

It is interesting to note that the diagnosis of aggressive periodontitis affected RAL-V gains but not PPD reduction. It seems that patients suffering from aggressive periodontitis have a higher risk for recessions than patients with chronic periodontitis.

]. However, D’Aiuto et al. observed more favorable PPD reduction at interproximal sites, whereas this study observed the contrary. The multilevel analysis performed in this study was adjusted for baseline PPD. Baseline pockets were deeper interproximally than at buccal or palatal/lingual sites. This might explain more favorable PPD reduction at interproximal sites without adjusting for baseline PPD. Considering the different therapies, SRP and AF provided better PPD reduction than no therapy. However, the analysis failed to reveal statistically significant differences between both therapies in single-rooted teeth. It seems that AF provides no advantages over SRP in single-rooted teeth.

] did not assess radiographic parameters. However, they considered tooth mobility and found mobility was correlated with less favorable PPD reduction. It is interesting to note that interproximal grooves that had been assessed as root double contours failed to influence the outcomes of therapy. Up to our best knowledge, this is the first analysis on the influence of baseline bone loss on the outcome of nonsurgical or surgical periodontal therapy that does not use patient means but individual tooth parameters.
Within the limitations of the present study the following conclusions may be drawn: (1) Nonsurgical and surgical periodontal therapies are effective in single-rooted teeth; (2) severe interproximal bone loss and infrabony defects deteriorate the clinical results, and (3) there seem to be more defect-associated (tooth, site) factors influencing treatment outcome than patient-associated factors.
