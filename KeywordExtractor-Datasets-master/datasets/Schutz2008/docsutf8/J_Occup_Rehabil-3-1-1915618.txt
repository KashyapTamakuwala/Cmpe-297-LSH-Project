]. Although the evidence from other studies did not overwhelmingly support the strength of the relationship, our results, presented in the Journal of Occupational Rehabilitation in 2003, were in contrast with other studies. It could not be determined whether the results found were weaker because of the operational definitions of pain-related fear (score on Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia (TSK)) or avoidance behavior (maximum lifting performance). It was recommended that future studies should use additional operational definitions for pain-related fear and avoidance behaviors.

Aim of this study was to further analyze the relationships between pain intensity and pain-related fear on the one hand, and avoidance behaviors on the other hand. Two studies were performed with separate samples of patients with CLBP. Pain related fears were operationally defined as the score on the TSK in study 1, and the Fear Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire (FABQ) in study 2. Avoidance behavior was in both studies operationally defined as the unwillingness to engage in high intensity performance levels of three different FCE tests: high intensity lifting, prolonged standing in a forward bend position, and fast repetitive bending at the waist. Non-significant or weak relationships were considered falsifications of the hypotheses that pain and pain-related fears would have clinically relevant impact on FCE performances in patients with CLBP.

]. Before testing, patients were instructed regarding termination of the test. Testing was terminated when one of the following occurred: the patient stated verbally that he/she wished to terminate the activity, the heart rate reached 85% of the age-related maximum, indicated by a heart rate monitor, or the evaluator deemed further testing to be unsafe. No verbal reassurance was given during the testing procedures. The evaluator was blinded to the questionnaire scores.

Analysis
28
]. Pain intensity and pain related fear, as well as gender, age and self-reported disability were entered as predictor variables in a multivariate linear regression model (method: enter) and performances as outcome variables. A p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant for all analyses.

], we have now used two new cohorts, two questionnaires instead of one to measure a wider range of pain related fears, and three performance tests instead of one to measure a wider range of avoidance behaviors. Additionally, we have added heart rate and observations as indices for effort level in lifting. Both pain intensity and pain related fear were poorly associated with indices for effort, explaining 7% or less of the variance. The results of the 2 new studies presented here are generally consistent with our previous study, which adds to the robustness of the results.
There may be several explanations for the weakness or non-existence of the associations between pain intensity and pain related fears on the one hand, and avoidance behaviors on the other hand. Pain intensity and pain related fears might have been inappropriately operationally defined by the NRS, the TSK and the FABQ, avoidance behavior might have been inappropriately operationally defined by the three performance measures, our study samples differ from samples reported elsewhere, or the variables were appropriately operationally defined, but the relationship was mediated by one or more currently unknown variables. Additionally, a combination of the above may explain our findings.

]. This similarity may rule out the plausibility the results of our study are caused by the selection of study samples. While the TSK and the FABQ may be considered among the consented standards to measure pain related fears, it may be possible that the domain measured might be too large and general to be of value in predicting specific behaviors such as the ones used in this study. This in itself could explain the findings of this study and the lack of consistent findings in previous research. However, if the measures are considered valid representations of the constructs pain intensity, pain related fear, and avoidance behavior, then a different explanation should be considered for our findings.

]. If a mediating effect or confounding of one or more different variables is present, then poor or non-existent associations between pain intensity, pain related fears and test performance are very well imaginable. Future studies should be conducted to find empirical evidence for the proposition that constructs as motivation and acceptance are more important predictors for functional capacity than pain or pain related fears. Additionally, other currently unknown variables may have played a mediating role in the relationship between pain variables and avoidance behaviors.
