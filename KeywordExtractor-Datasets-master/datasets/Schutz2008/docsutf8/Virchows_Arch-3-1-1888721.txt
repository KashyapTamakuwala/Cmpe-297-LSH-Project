 = 21). In 19 cases, metastases from other sites involved the breast, most commonly (58%) cutaneous melanoma. Invasive carcinoma of the male breast appears to display a morphologic spectrum and distribution of histologic subtypes that is comparable to those of the female breast, with some expected variation. Compared with published experience on their female counterparts, there is a two-fold increase in the frequency of invasive papillary carcinoma in the male breast. Finally, the most common tumor metastatic to the male breast in this series was cutaneous melanoma.

] found that the incidence of male breast cancer increased from 0.86 to 1.08 per 100,000 population. This increasing incidence, in addition to the better elucidation of the role of BRCA2 mutations in male breast cancer, has renewed interest in specifically identifying the underlying pathogenesis of male breast cancer and clarifying the specific differences, if any, between male and female breast cancer.

]. However, these studies generally do not have the distribution and relative frequencies of the various histologic subtypes as their main focus, and as such, pathologically important distinctions such as signet ring vs colloid carcinoma (both subsumed under mucin producing carcinoma), or metaplastic carcinoma vs infiltrating duct carcinoma not otherwise specified are not emphasized. Over- or underepresentation of a particular histologic subtype in male breast cancers may provide valuable insight into the etiopathogenetic differences between male and female breast cancers and may provide an important nidus for further studies.
In this study, we investigated the frequencies and distribution of the various histologic subtypes in a large data set of invasive carcinomas seen at a large tertiary center over a 40-year period. Our goals are to document these frequencies and distribution and to see whether any histologic subtypes are notably distinct in frequency of occurrence in the male breast, as compared with historical published data on similar lesions in the female breast. The frequencies and sites of origin of metastatic tumors to the male breast during the study period were also investigated.

The other 200 cases did not have all of the patients’ slides pertaining to the lesion available and the final interpretation was based on the descriptions of morphology in the AFIP files. Because cases sent to AFIP are mostly for confirmation of diagnosis, information about therapy beyond what was in the surgical pathology report or the accompanying cover letter are generally not available. Some patients had repeated material sent to AFIP as the lesion recurred, which is how follow-up information was collected in a small subset of cases.

In this study, we investigated in detail the frequencies and distribution of the various histologic subtypes in a large data set of invasive carcinomas seen at a large tertiary center over a 40-year period. Our findings suggest that invasive carcinoma of the male breast displays a morphologic spectrum and distribution of histologic subtypes that is comparable to invasive carcinoma of the female breast and that no specific histologic subtypes are notably over- or underrepresented with the exception of papillary and lobular variants.

 < 0.0001). However, the differences between males and females with respect to the frequencies of the other histologic subtypes were also statistically significant. The significance of the papillary histologic subtype or papillary architecture in male ductal carcinoma requires further investigation but is most probably related to the architecture of the male mammary duct system with dominance of larger ducts.

], was not the most common metastatic tumor in this series. The number of metastatic tumors in this series is relatively small, which is a limitation in interpreting the distribution of originating sites. Nonetheless, in the investigation of metastatic tumors to the male breast of an unknown primary site, our findings provide additional data on some of the most likely sites.

], lobular carcinomas constituted 1.5% for their male breast cancers. It is noteworthy that all of these cases were interpreted as lobular based on morphology without E-cadherin immunostain confirmation.
In summary, invasive carcinoma of the male breast appears to display a morphologic spectrum and distribution of histologic subtypes, which is comparable to invasive carcinoma of the female breast with some variation. As expected, lobular carcinoma is exceedingly rare but was encountered in this series. There appears to be a twofold increase in the frequency of invasive papillary carcinoma and metastatic cancers to the male breast as compared to published data in the female breast. Finally, the most common tumor metastatic to the male breast in this series was cutaneous melanoma.
