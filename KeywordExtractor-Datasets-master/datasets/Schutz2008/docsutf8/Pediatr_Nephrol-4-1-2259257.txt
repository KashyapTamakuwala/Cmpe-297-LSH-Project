 = 0.1). Patients with and without nephrotoxic CsA therapy showed a drop in GFR. In CsA-treated patients, GFR was about 12% lower at latest follow-up compared with patients without nephrotoxic therapy but always remained within normal range. CsA seems to be safe, even in long-term treatment for more than 5 years.

No study evaluated an additional control group without nephrotoxic therapy to demonstrate the physiological development of GFR in patients with SDNS.



In this study, we focus on the long-term renal function in 20 children with biopsy-proven MCNS treated with CsA for a mean of 5.36 ± 2.2 (range 2–11) years. The development of GFR in these patients is compared with a control group with SDNS without CsA therapy.

] postulated that in case of striped interstitial fibrosis, some nephrons undergo atrophy while their function could be compensated for by unaffected nephrons. This may mask nephrotoxicity by measurements of normal GFR. In summary, a clear proven association between impaired renal function and long-term CsA therapy in patients with MCNS could not be found. But hints permit the question regarding the safety of long-term CsA therapy in children with a benign renal disease.

 after CsA had been stopped.
Interestingly, in our control group of patients without CsA therapy, an initial drop in GFR was also found. Those patients showed a mean drop in GFR of about 5% within the 12 weeks of CP therapy, and GFR even dropped about 8% until the latest follow-up. Probably, the observed decrease in GFR in patients with CsA therapy cannot only be attributed to the hitherto described nephrotoxic effect of CsA.
12
] mentioned the potential increase of GFR caused by the mineralocorticoid effect of concomitant steroid medication. One could speculate that the cessation of steroids might lead to a physiological drop in GFR. Additionally, a possible but not proven interpretation should be discussed: Part of the GFR reduction may be attributable to normalisation of hyperfiltration in nephrotic children during the first months after initiation of immunosuppressive therapy. In patients with relapsing nephrotic syndrome, long-term immunosuppressive drugs (e.g. cyclophosphamide, CsA, chlorambucil) are initiated after urine remission has been achieved; complete remission of serum albumin normally is not awaited.
15
]. Normalisation of the increased filtration extends over weeks and leads to a decrease in GFR physiologically. This phenomenon may explain the drop in GFR, even in patients without nephrotoxic treatment.
In summary, this study offers long-term follow-up of 20 patients with proven SSNS treated with CsA for a median of 5 years. Initially, the patients showed a drop in GFR but remained stable afterwards. None developed chronic renal failure. Nevertheless, the generalisation of these results are limited, as the study was retrospective, and only 5/20 patients underwent renal biopsy under long-term nephrotoxic treatment. It is questionable whether a prospective study to evaluate the outcome of long-term CsA therapy in children with MCNS is reasonable in the future. Newer, nonnephrotoxic drugs, e.g. mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) are of concern and need to be evaluated for efficacy and safety in the treatment of SDNS and FRNS. However, our analysis demonstrates that even long-term therapy with CsA for more than 5 years in children with MCNS is safe and does not impair renal function.
