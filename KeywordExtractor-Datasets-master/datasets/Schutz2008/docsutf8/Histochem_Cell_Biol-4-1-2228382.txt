-Golgi network (TGN) is one of the main, if not the main, sorting stations in the process of intracellular protein trafficking. It is therefore of central importance to understand how the key players in the TGN-based sorting and delivery process, the post-Golgi carriers (PGCs), form and function. Over the last few years, modern morphological approaches have generated new insights into the questions of PGC biogenesis, structure and dynamics. Here, we present a view by which the “lifecycle” of a PGC consists of several distinct stages: the formation of TGN tubular export domains (where different cargoes are segregated from each other and from the Golgi enzymes); the docking of these tubular domains onto molecular motors and their extrusion towards the cell periphery along microtubules; the fission of the forming PGC from the donor membrane; and the delivery of the newly formed PGC to its specific acceptor organelle. It is now important to add the many molecular machineries that have been described as operating at the TGN to this “morphofunctional map” of the TGN export process.

). Then, with time, the list of cargo molecules that could be visualized in vivo expanded, further exposing the unexpected complexity of the post-Golgi transport pathways. Finally, further technical advances resulted in the combination of video and electron microscopy (correlative light-electron microscopy, CLEM), which provided the means to define the morphogenesis of these PGCs at the ultrastructural level.

). The smaller PGCs usually have a size of 300–400 nm, although some of the larger ones can reach several microns in length. Video microscopy has also revealed that many of these carriers appear globular, although they frequently stretch out into tubular shapes during their translocation through the cytosol; thus PGCs have frequently been termed as “pleiomorphic” structures.

). These exchanges with the endocytic systems could well introduce a further level of structural complications, since the recycling endosomes, in particular, reside in the Golgi area and are tubular in nature. In conclusion, both the dynamics and the structure of the TGN are variable and incompletely defined, thereby presenting an additional layer of difficulty to our understanding of the biogenesis of the carriers that depart from this organelle.

Formation of PGC precursors at the TGN
There are two key aspects to the formation of the PGC precursors: their morphogenesis at the TGN; and the segregation between different types of cargo proteins that are targeted for different destinations, as well as between the Golgi-resident proteins, such as the Golgi enzymes.

). The second possibility is that these precursors are actually formed from the tubular subdomains of the TGN, which are generated prior to docking and extrusion by microtubules. In this case, the GPCs should reflect the morphologically complex structure of their parent membranes.
2003
1995
2003
2003

). Thus structural similarities between PGC precursors and the TGN appear to be a common feature of different types of PGCs. This strongly suggests that PGCs form via the fission of an entire precursor domain (or a large part thereof) from the rest of the TGN membranes.

Moreover, preferential sites of PGC docking and fusion can also be easily identified in this way. The combination of these experimental approaches with specific molecular inhibitors now allows us to attribute a protein of interest to one of the steps in post-Golgi transport.
