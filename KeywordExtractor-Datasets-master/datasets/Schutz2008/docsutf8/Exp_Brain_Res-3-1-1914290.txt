The influence of attention on the dynamical structure of postural sway was examined in 30 healthy young adults by manipulating the focus of attention. In line with the proposed direct relation between the amount of attention invested in postural control and regularity of center-of-pressure (COP) time series, we hypothesized that: (1) increasing cognitive involvement in postural control (i.e., creating an internal focus by increasing task difficulty through visual deprivation) increases COP regularity, and (2) withdrawing attention from postural control (i.e., creating an external focus by performing a cognitive dual task) decreases COP regularity. We quantified COP dynamics in terms of sample entropy (regularity), standard deviation (variability), sway-path length of the normalized posturogram (curviness), largest Lyapunov exponent (local stability), correlation dimension (dimensionality) and scaling exponent (scaling behavior). Consistent with hypothesis 1, standing with eyes closed significantly increased COP regularity. Furthermore, variability increased and local stability decreased, implying ineffective postural control. Conversely, and in line with hypothesis 2, performing a cognitive dual task while standing with eyes closed led to greater irregularity and smaller variability, suggesting an increase in the “efficiency, or “automaticity” of postural control”. In conclusion, these findings not only indicate that regularity of COP trajectories is positively related to the amount of attention invested in postural control, but also substantiate that in certain situations an increased internal focus may in fact be detrimental to postural control.

 with their arms hanging relaxed alongside their body. The medial sides of the heels were separated by about 8 cm and each foot was placed with the toes outward at a 10° angle from the sagittal midline (i.e., standard Romberg position). In order to examine the role of attention in the regulation of posture we carried out two manipulations. On the one hand, we increased the postural task difficulty by inviting participants to stand with eyes closed, while on the other hand, we withdrew attention from postural control by inviting them to perform a cognitive dual task. In particular, the participants were invited to stand upright with (1) eyes open (EO-ST), (2) eyes closed (EC-ST), (3) eyes open while performing a dual task (EO-DT) and (4) eyes closed while performing a dual task (EC-DT). The dual task consisted of uttering backwards names read out aloud by the investigator (e.g., “Simon” had to be repeated as “nomis”). The sole aim of this cognitive dual task was to withdraw attention from the postural task. Therefore, the participants were instructed to perform the task to the best of their ability. No feedback on the accuracy with which they performed this task was provided. Each participant performed the four task conditions in random order and once in reverse order, resulting in a total of eight recordings. COP trajectories were collected for 35 s at a sampling rate of 100 Hz.
After the local ethics committee had approved the study, all participants gave their informed consent prior to their participation.

Results
The result section is organized as follows. We first report possible differences in the dependent variables between the eyes open and eyes closed conditions (i.e., main effect of vision, hypothesis 1). Second, we describe the effect of experimentally withdrawing attention from postural control by comparing single task and dual task conditions (i.e., main effect of dual task, hypothesis 2). Third, we report whether significant vision × dual task interaction effects were present. Finally, we present the effects of plane, which may reveal possible directional differences in control. In this context, we also report the effects of randomization on the dependent variables to ensure that the observed changes in the dynamics of COP trajectories were genuine effects.

Discussion
The present experiment was conducted to investigate the role of attention in the regulation of posture. Specifically, we examined whether an increase in postural sway regularity (i.e., as indexed by a decrease in SEn) is representative of an increase in cognitive investment in postural control. We hypothesized that COP trajectories become more regular (i.e., SEn decreases) when task difficulty is increased (EC vs. EO) and, conversely, become less regular (i.e., SEn increases) when an attention-demanding cognitive dual task is introduced (DT vs. ST). We further expected that these changes in regularity of COP fluctuations would be accompanied by changes in variability, local stability, sway-path length, dimensionality and scaling exponent reflecting functional modifications of postural control. For the proper interpretation of the present findings, however, it was necessary to ascertain that the observed structure (and changes herein) of the COP fluctuations did not result from noise, but was indeed brought about by deterministic processes. Therefore, we will first discuss the results of the surrogate analyses before discussing the respective effects of vision, dual task and plane on the dynamical structure of postural sway.

). If the proposed relation between cognitive investment in postural control and postural sway regularity does indeed exist, then the performance of a cognitive dual task should result in less regular COP trajectories. That this was indeed the case will be discussed in the next two subsections.

Withdrawing attention from posture
The performance of a concurrent dual task led to changes in scaling exponents and an increase in dimensionality, reflecting cognition-invoked adjustments of postural control. These changes under dual task performance may have served to enrich the information captured in sway fluctuations without increasing the amount of sway (i.e., variability remained unaltered). This interpretation is amplified by the observation that the sway-path length of the normalized posturogram increased, indicating more twisting and turning in the COP trajectories. Interestingly, despite the fact that attention was withdrawn experimentally from postural control, local stability remained unaltered. In contrast to what we expected, no main effect of dual task was found for SEn. However, this finding does not necessarily militate against the proposed relation between the regularity of COP fluctuations and the amount of attention directed to postural control, as will be argued in the following subsection.

). All in all, it is fair to conclude that the methodological and analytical approach adopted in the present study allows for disentangling whether or not there is an increase in cognitive involvement and to what extent an increase in cognitive involvement has a detrimental or beneficial effect.
