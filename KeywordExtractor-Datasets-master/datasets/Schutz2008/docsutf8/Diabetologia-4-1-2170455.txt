Aims/hypothesis
Abnormalities in retinal haemodynamics have been reported in patients with type 1 diabetes in advance of clinical retinopathy. These abnormalities could therefore be useful as early markers or surrogate endpoints for studying the microangiopathy. Since the DCCT, the increased focus on good glycaemic control is changing the natural history of diabetic retinopathy. Based on this, the aim of this study was to investigate whether patients with type 1 diabetes treated entirely or mostly in the post-DCCT era and tested in the absence of confounding factors show retinal haemodynamic abnormalities.

Methods
We measured retinal haemodynamics by laser Doppler flowmetry in 33 type 1 diabetic individuals with no or minimal retinopathy (age 30 ± 7 years, duration of diabetes 8.8 ± 4.6 years, 9% showing microaneurysms), and 31 age- and sex-matched non-diabetic controls. The study participants were not taking vasoactive medications, and blood glucose at the time of haemodynamic measurements was required to be between 3.8 and 11.1 mmol/l.

Results
1c
 was 7.5 ± 1.2% and blood glucose 7.7 ± 2.8 mmol/l in these type 1 diabetic individuals, indicating relatively good glycaemic control. Retinal blood speed, arterial diameter and blood flow were not different between the diabetic individuals and the matched controls.

Conclusions/interpretation
Type 1 diabetic patients with no or minimal retinopathy who maintain relatively good glycaemic control do not show abnormalities of the retinal circulation at steady state, even after several years of diabetes. In such patients it may be necessary to test the vascular response to challenges to uncover any subtle abnormalities of the retinal vessels.

]. It also proved that today’s means of achieving good control are imperfect, and that some patients may still progress to sight-threatening stages of retinopathy. With the latter finding, the DCCT encouraged continuation of the quest for therapies able to pre-empt the effects of the residual hyperglycaemia; however, by increasing the prevalence of good glycaemic control it made any trial of such therapies extremely long and expensive. For this reason, there is heightened interest in early markers of retinopathy to be used as surrogates to test adjunct therapies.

]. Unfortunately, the latter study did not report levels of glycaemic control. The next step will be to compare in the same well-controlled type 1 diabetic individuals the behaviour of retinal haemodynamics at steady state and in response to a challenge. In this way we will begin to reconstruct systematically the history of retinal microangiopathy in the post-DCCT era.
