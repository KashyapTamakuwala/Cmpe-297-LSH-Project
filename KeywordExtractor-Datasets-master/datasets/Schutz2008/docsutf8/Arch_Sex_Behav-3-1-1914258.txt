 = 296). Given the proposition that safer sex behavior among HIV-positive people is a form of prosocial behavior, the present study extended the general framework of the Theory of Planned Behavior with Schwartz’s norm-activation theory and tested the assumption that personal norms would mediate the effects of other psychosocial factors on intended condom use for anal sex. In addition, it was hypothesized that, depending on the context in which sex occurs, specific motives for unprotected anal sex may have a negative influence on intended condom use and, as such, undermine a prosocial tendency to practice safer sex. Therefore, we also investigated the influence of sexual motives for unprotected anal sex on intended condom use with steady and casual sex partners. Results indicated that the Theory of Planned Behavior adequately predicted condom use intentions (for casual sex partners and steady sex partners, the explained variance was 52% and 53%, respectively). However, our proposed model of sexual decision-making significantly improved the prediction of behavioral intentions. For steady and casual sex partners, the assumption of the mediating role of personal norms on condom use intention was confirmed empirically. Additionally, sexual motives for unprotected anal sex exerted, as expected, a direct, negative effect on condom use intention with casual sex partners. The implications of the findings for future research and the development of HIV-prevention programs for HIV-positive MSM are discussed.

). As such, we expect that, in predicting safer sex, awareness of need and ascription of responsibility may be important determinants of behavioral intention to use condoms for anal sex with steady and casual sex partners. Note that in this context, efficacy and ability are not differentiated because both concepts seem to be covered by the theoretical paradigm of the TPB (i.e., attitude and self-efficacy, respectively).

Method
Participants
Data were obtained by means of a self-administered questionnaire between July 2002 and April 2003. Participants were recruited through AIDS consultants working in 15 Dutch hospitals. Participants were asked to fill out the questionnaire at home and return the questionnaires directly to the research institution by means of a stamped, pre-addressed envelope. Consequently, no information was available about the response rate per hospital. Participation was on a voluntary and anonymous basis. A pilot study indicated that completion of the questionnaire took about 30 to 45 min. Participants received no compensation for filling out the questionnaires. Approval for the study was obtained from the Ethics Committee of Maastricht University Hospital.
Participants who met the following criteria were included in the study: (1) tested positive for HIV-antibodies; (2) identified themselves as homosexual or bisexual; (3) aged between 20 and 65 years; and (4) were sufficiently fluent in Dutch to complete the questionnaire. A total of 1,050 questionnaires were distributed, of which 296 were completed and returned (response rate = 28.2%).

) and consisted of several questions on determinants for explaining condom use behavior: attitudinal beliefs, subjective norms, self-efficacy, personal norms, awareness of consequences, ascription of responsibility, sexual motives, intention and demographic variables. Separate scales were used for condom use with steady and casual sex partners for all determinants. The questionnaire was pre-tested among a group of 12 HIV-positive MSM for comprehension and completeness.
Attitudinal beliefs
2005
2000
). Four items were used to assess response efficacy (e.g., “By using condoms when having anal intercourse, I protect my steady partner/casual sex partners against the AIDS virus/HIV-superinfection”). In addition, seven possible pros (e.g., “By using condoms during anal sex with my steady partner/casual sex partners, I worry less about his/their well-being”), and five possible cons of condom use behavior (e.g., “Using condoms for anal sex with my steady partner/casual sex partners reminds me of HIV/AIDS”) were included in the questionnaire. Items were indexed on 5-point scales (1 = totally disagree, 5 = totally agree), and had an alpha of .81 for steady and .76 for casual sex partners.
Subjective norms
1973
), one item assessed perceived social sanctions regarding not using condoms during anal intercourse and was expressed as follows: “How do you think important others would react if you told them that you don’t use condoms when having anal intercourse with your steady partner/casual sex partners?” (1 = very approving, 5 = very disapproving). Alpha for steady and casual sex partners was. 76 and .63, respectively.
Self-efficacy
2005
2000
) (e.g., “Suppose you want to use condoms when having anal intercourse, will you be able to discuss condom use with your steady partner/casual sex partners?”). Items were measured on 5-point scales (1 = certainly not, 5 = certainly), and had an alpha of .89 for steady and .87 for casual sex partners.
Personal norms
1996
1995
), such as: “As a matter of principle, I use condoms every time I have anal intercourse with my steady partner/casual partners.” Items were rated on 5-point scales (1 = totally disagree, 5 = totally agree) and had an alpha of .96 and .90 for steady and casual sex partners, respectively.
awareness of consequences for self
awareness of consequences for others
 were assessed separately for condom use with steady and casual sex partners by a single item on a 5-point (1 = totally agree, 5 = totally disagree) scale. Awareness of consequences for self measured the participant’s view about whether the consequences for his health were negligible when not using condoms during anal sex. Awareness of consequences for others measured the participant’s views about whether the consequences for the health of his partner were negligible when not using condoms during anal sex.
Ascription of responsibility
yourself
 for negotiating condom use?” (1 = not at all, 5 = completely). Alpha for steady and casual sex partners was .91 and .89, respectively.
Sexual motives
in press
), participants were asked to indicate the extent to which they would feel a particular emotion when engaging in unprotected anal sex with steady (alpha = .89) and casual sex partners (alpha = .85).
Intention
 to use condoms when having anal intercourse was measure by the following three items on 5-point scales: “I intend to use a condom when having anal intercourse with my steady partner/casual partners”; “I will try to use a condom when …”; and “I plan to use a condom when …” (1 = certainly not, 5 = certainly). Alpha for both steady and casual sex partners was .93.
sexual risk behavior
, participants were asked whether or not they had engaged in receptive and insertive oral sex with ejaculation and in receptive and insertive anal sex in the past six months (separate for steady and casual sex partners). For each sexual behavior they had engaged in, the frequency of condom use (1 = never, 5 = always) was assessed.

1991
), our proposed model of sexual decision-making led to a significant increase of explained variance from 53% to 62% for steady sex partners and from 52% to 68% for casual sex partners. Furthermore, evidence was obtained for the mediating role of personal norms on intended condom use with both steady and casual sex partners, suggesting that moral issues play an important role. However, the study also showed that sexual motives may undermine the influence of personal norms on intended condom use in the context of casual sex, with the likelihood of unprotected sexual intercourse. Taken together, the results revealed strong support for our model of sexual decision-making.

). For steady partners, personal norms were identified as the most proximal determinant of intended condom use, whereas an indirect effect was found for self-efficacy on intended condom use through personal norms. Furthermore, some evidence that personal norms mediate the tentative effect of subjective norms on intended condom use with steady sex partners was found. Similar results were found for intended condom use with casual sex partners. However, we also found an additional indirect effect of ascription of responsibility on intended condom use through personal norms. These findings are important because they underscore the need to take into account the role of social expectations, self-efficacy expectations, and attributions about responsibility for condom use in promoting feelings of moral obligation-a process that has not been identified in previous research on sexual risk behavior in HIV-positive MSM.

It is possible that the sensitivity of the subject and the fact that the participants suffer from a chronic disease may create barriers to participation. Moreover, substantial efforts were made to recruit HIV-positive MSM from throughout the Netherlands. Although this approach did not ensure that the sample was representative, it did enhance its diversity and therefore strengthens the external validity of the study results.
