We review the imaging findings of pediatric gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs) using contemporary anatomic and molecular imaging techniques. A low index of suspicion can result in significant delays in diagnosis of pediatric GEP-NETs. A multimodality imaging approach, using both anatomic and functional imaging, is essential in the diagnosis, staging, and surveillance of these potentially malignant tumors.

 = 1), and in two patients the tumor was primary unknown. Six patients had functional tumors and were symptomatic for several months to 5 years (mean 2 years) with symptoms including diarrhea, peptic ulcer disease, abdominal pain, and weight loss. Metastases were present in 50% of these patients by the time a GEP-NET was diagnosed. Two of the three patients with pulmonary NET tumors presented with recurrent pneumonia. One patient with an unsuspected NET developed carcinoid crisis after resection of the tumor and required intensive care management. One patient had a history of a familial disorder, von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease, predisposing to NET.

. Functional tumors have clinical symptoms caused by hypersecretion of hormones such as gastrin, while nonfunctional tumors can produce clinically silent hormones such as pancreatic polypeptide. These tumors often produce more than one hormone, and the functional tumors are named according to the hormone responsible for the clinical syndrome, for example gastrinoma causing Zollinger-Ellison syndrome and insulinoma causing hypoglycemic syndrome. NETs can either be sporadic or occur as part of familial syndromes such as multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) I and II, VHL syndrome and neurofibromatosis type I (NF-I).

]. Ileal NETs might present with abdominal pain or diarrhea secondary to increased intestinal motility or obstruction secondary to intussusception. In the hindgut, the most common location of NETs is the rectum. Most of these tumors are nonfunctional, with rectal NETs having a better prognosis than NETs in other parts of the colon.

Hepatic NETs

]. It is unclear whether these tumors represent true primary hepatic neoplasms or metastases from asymptomatic occult NETs. Like the primary NETs, liver lesions are hypointense on T1-W images, hyperintense on T2-W images, and demonstrate arterial phase enhancement.

Conclusions
A low index of suspicion for GEP-NETs in children combined with nonspecific clinical complaints can result in delay in the detection of these rare but treatable malignancies. A multimodality imaging approach using both anatomic and functional imaging is essential in the diagnosis, staging, and surveillance of these potentially malignant tumors in children.
