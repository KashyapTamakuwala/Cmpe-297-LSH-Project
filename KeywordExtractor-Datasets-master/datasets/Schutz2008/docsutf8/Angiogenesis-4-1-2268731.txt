Angiogenesis is considered a promising target in the treatment of cancer. Most of the angiogenesis inhibitors in late-stage clinical testing or approved for the treatment of cancer act indirectly on endothelial cells. They either neutralize angiogenic growth factors from the circulation or block the signaling pathways activated by these growth factors. Another group of angiogenesis inhibitors are the direct angiostatic compounds. These agents have a direct effect on the endothelium, affecting cellular regulatory pathways, independently of the tumor cells. The reason that this category of agents is lagging behind regarding their translation to the clinic may be the lack of sufficient knowledge on the mechanism of action of these compounds. The transcription factor NF-κB has been recently connected with multiple aspects of angiogenesis. In addition, several recent studies report that angiogenesis inhibition is associated to NF-κB activation. This is of special interest since in tumor cells NF-κB activation has been associated to inhibition of apoptosis and currently novel treatment strategies are being developed based on inhibition of NF-κB. The paradigm that systemic NF-κB inhibition can serve as an anti-cancer strategy, therefore, might need to be re-evaluated. Based on recent data, it might be speculated that NF-κB activation, when performed specifically in endothelial cells, could be an efficient strategy for the treatment of cancer.

Introduction

Fig. 1
Schematic NF-κB pathway. In the canonical activation pathway, NF-κB (often the dimer composed of p50/p65) is sequestered by its main inhibitor IκB-α. Upon stimulation, cell surface receptors activate IKK complex, which then phosphorylate IκB-α. These phosphorylations lead to its degradation by the proteasome and the entry of NF-κB in the nucleus, which turns on target genes

]. Histological analysis revealed a striking increase in tumor vascularization in these mice. This study highlighted, for the first time, the in vivo role of NF-κB in tumor angiogenesis, indicating an inhibitory role for NF-κB in tumor angiogenesis. Based on this study, NF-κB activation in endothelial cells appears to be a way to block angiogenesis. However, it is unknown how specific activation of NF-κB in endothelial cells can be realized and through which mechanisms NF-κB activation leads to inhibition of angiogenesis.

In conclusion, while in tumor cells NF-κB is mostly described as an oncogenic factor, up-regulation of NF-κB in endothelial cells is associated with angiostatic activity. It might therefore be warranted to revisit anti-cancer therapies based on inhibition of NF-κB activity for effects on angiogenesis.

]. Therefore, activation of NF-κB by angiostatic therapy does not directly affect angiogenesis but also has an indirect effect via expression of adhesion molecules and subsequent reversal of endothelial cell anergy. Therefore, such activation of NF-κB resulting in stimulation of anti-tumor immunity but also in inhibition of angiogenesis clearly results in an anti-tumor outcome.

Where to go from here?

Fig. 2
Model of the dual role of NF-κB in tumorigenesis. In tumor cells, activation of NF-κB leads to tumor growth by both direct and indirect mechanisms. The direct mechanisms involve expression of anti-apoptotic and pro-proliferative molecules while the indirect mechanism involves promotion of angiogenesis. In endothelial cells, activation of NF-κB can block tumor progression by both, angiostatic activity, via the production of pro-apoptotic molecules and by improvement of immune response via expression of adhesion molecules
