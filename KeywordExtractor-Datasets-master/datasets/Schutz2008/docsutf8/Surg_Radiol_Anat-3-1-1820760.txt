While most obstetric brachial plexus palsy patients recover arm and hand function, the residual nerve weakness leads to muscle imbalances about the shoulder which may cause bony deformities. In this paper we describe abnormalities in the developing scapula and the glenohumeral joint. We introduce a classification for the deformity which we term Scapular Hypoplasia, Elevation and Rotation. Multiple anatomic parameters were measured in bilateral CT images and three-dimensional CT reconstruction of the shoulder girdle of 30 obstetric brachial plexus palsy patients (age range 10 months–10.6 years). The affected scapulae were found to be hypoplastic by an average of 14% while the ratio of the height to the width of the body of scapula (excluding acromion) were not significantly changed, the acromion was significantly elongated by an average of 19%. These parameters as well as subluxation of the humeral head (average 14%) and downward rotation in the scapular plane were found to correlate with the area of scapula visible over the clavicle. This finding provides a classification tool for diagnosis and objective evaluation of the bony deformity and its severity in obstetric brachial plexus palsy patients.

In the current study, we describe dysplasia and malposition of the entire scapula in obstetric brachial plexus palsy patients. We introduce a classification of this deformity which we term collectively Scapular Hypoplasia, Elevation and Rotation (SHEAR).

Methods
Patients
A total of 30 obstetric brachial plexus palsy patients with glenohumeral internal rotation were evaluated in the past 6 months. We reviewed the clinical data on these patients and diagnosed and classified the scapular elevation according to the results of clinical examination and analysis. There were 10 boys and 20 girls ranging in age from 10 months to 10.6 years. Three of the children had not undergone any surgery. Twenty-four of the children had undergone latissimus dorsi and teres major muscle transfer, subscapularis, pectoralis major and minor contracture releases and axillary nerve decompression and neurolysis for correction of abduction at our institute in the past. Twelve of the latter group and one that had not undergone the aforementioned procedure had undergone primary neurological repair surgery.

Measurements
Transverse CT section and three-dimensional reconstructions of bilateral computerized tomograms (3D-CT) were used in the evaluation process. Trunk anterior and trunk posterior views of the whole shoulder girdle as well as superior trunk outlet and scapular posterior and medial views were examined. The contralateral scapulae were assessed for comparison.

A line perpendicular to the scapular line is drawn and the percentage of posterior subluxation is defined as the ratio of the distance from the scapular line to the anterior portion of the head to the diameter of the humeral head (LM/LN × 100).

The total area of the scapula was calculated on the scapular posterior view. The area of the scapula visible on the anterior view above the clavicle with reference to the contralateral side was measured on the trunk anterior view. For distance and area measurements, graphic software (Universal Desktop Ruler, AVPSoft.com) was used.

The different SHEAR stages of scapular deformity as determined by three dimensional computer tomography. In SHEAR Grade 0 less than 2% of the scapula, less than 20% of the superior border and less than 6.5% of the medial border are visible above the clavicle. In SHEAR Grade 1 2–3.6% of the scapular area, 20–45% of the superior border and 6.5–16.5% of the medial border are visible over the clavicle. In SHEAR Grade 2 3.6–20% of the scapular area, 45–58% of the superior border and 16.5–28% of the medial border are visible above the clavicle. In SHEAR Grade 3 20–45% of the scapula, 58–68% of the superior border and 28–50% of the medial border are visible over the scapula. In SHEAR Grade 4 more than 42% of the area of the scapula, more than 68.5% of the superior border and more than 50% of the medial border are visible over the scapula





Discussion
The position of the affected scapula did not follow the symptoms and characteristics of Sprengel’s deformity with congenital origin of scapular elevation. The hypoplasia and positioning of the scapula result from the brachial plexus injury and the apparent elevation is the result of downward rotation about an axis perpendicular to the scapular plane.

Rotation about the axis of the scapular spine was in all but one instance anterior, forming a narrower scapuloclavicular space on the superior trunk outlet view.

], may reflect the fact that most of our patients had undergone contracture releases of the latissimus dorsi, teres major, subscapularis, and pectoralis major and minor with tendon transfer of latissimus dorsi and teres major. While global abduction in our series was near normal, the forces exerted by the muscles on the two scapulas are not equivalent obviously upholding impaired growth to the affected scapula. The rate of progression of the deformity is individual to the child.

]. While derotational osteotomy may restore external rotation by placing the arm in a more functional position it addresses neither the scapular nor the glenohumeral deformities. Our findings that SHEAR score based on the percentage of scapula visible over the clavicle strongly correlates with rotation of the scapula, hypoplasia and subluxation, provides a convenient diagnostic tool to assess the presence of the MRC deformity. With the pathophysiology being thus established, anatomical correction of the deformity can be considered and planned, hopefully with improvement in functional parameters.

Conclusion
Scapular deformities common to the population of obstetric brachial plexus palsy patients due to muscular imbalances resulting from residual neurological deficit can be diagnosed and classified using the SHEAR classification and enable objective evaluation of the bony deformity and its severity as guide for treatment.
