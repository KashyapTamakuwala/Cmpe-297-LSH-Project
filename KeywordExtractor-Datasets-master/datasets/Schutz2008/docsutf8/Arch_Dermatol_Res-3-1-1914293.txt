 = 0.01). HHV-7-protein positive cell numbers diminished significantly after remission in both dermis and epidermis. Expression of HHV-7 was mainly detected in BDCA-2 positive plasmacytoid dendritic cells rather than CD-3 positive lymphocytes. HHV-7 replicates in plasmacytoid dendritic cells in lesional lichen planus skin and diminishes after remission. This study further supports our hypothesis that HHV-7 is associated with lichen planus pathogenesis.

]. Like Epstein Barr virus reactivation is associated with Burkitt lymphoma, reactivation of HHV-7 during adulthood could be associated with lichen planus. To support this hypothesis, we quantified and compared the presence of HHV-7 DNA and protein in lesional lichen planus skin before, and after treatment-induced remission.

]. In short, before treatment was initiated, two 4 mm full thickness skin biopsies were obtained from lesional skin. Patients were treated with 40 mg prednisone per os daily, diminished with 5 mg every other day until a daily dose of 20 mg was reached. From that point on, the prednisone dosage was diminished with 5 mg per week. If new lichen planus lesions recurred, the previous dose was administered and diminishment halted for 3 weeks. In case prednisone treatment was contra-indicated, other treatment options like topical corticosteroids, oral acitretin (0.5 mg/kg body weight) and psoralen ultraviolet A combined photo therapy were considered, depending on the extent of lesions and underlying medical conditions.

During follow up (with a minimum period of 30 months) 9 out of 16 patients experienced a relapse of lichen planus symptoms, 6 patients within 1 year, 3 within 4 years. All relapses occurred in patients treated with oral prednisone. In 2 patients with relapses, remnant inflammation after remission had been noticed.

Discussion
Lichen planus is characterized by a band-like lymphocytic infiltrate, which seems to be involved in an attack of the basal epidermal layer. It is suggested that these T lymphocytes are directed towards infected skin cells expressing viral antigens. Molecular mimicry is a second conceivable inflammatory mechanism initiated by microbial antigens or microbial-reactive T lymphocytes that cross react with self antigens sharing homology (i.e., basal layer structures).

].
Here we investigated the effect of therapy-induced remission of lichen planus on HHV-7 replication. Both the number of HHV-7 DNA containing skin samples and the absolute number of HHV-7 antigen containing skin cells (in dermis and epidermis) diminished significantly after treatment-induced remission. Since we included a 2-week washout period between treatment termination and obtaining the post remission biopsies, a direct medication effect on viral replication is unlikely. In contrast to a fourfold diminution in HHV-7 positive cells after treatment, there was only a twofold reduction in the number of BDCA2 positive plasmacytoid dendritic cells. This makes it unlikely that the diminished HHV-7 expression only depends on a reduced number of plasmacytoid dendritic cells after treatment. Whether plasmacytoid dendritic cells are carriers of HHV-7 driving the disease activity or that these cells are infected as innocent bystanders, or actively induce the inflammatory process is not yet clear and needs further study.

It is unlikely that HHV-7 primary infections cause lichen planus, since first transmission mostly occurs during childhood, whereas lichen planus affects mainly patients during midlife. Yet, it is conceivable that HHV-7 reactivation triggers lichen planus, in the same fashion as Epstein-Barr virus reactivation is associated with Burkitt lymphoma.
The apparent paradoxical efficacy of steroid therapy in lichen planus and a considered viral cause can be explained by a “hit and run” model where the actual viral reactivation would be short lived but subsequently responsible for an independently propagated inflammatory skin reaction. This could also explain why not in all patients HHV-7 was detected at the time of inclusion. Moreover, in one patient (no. 15) HHV-7 DNA was detected after remission. It is this patient that experienced a relapse 1 month later and returned to the clinic for additional treatment. Possibly HHV-7 can trigger lichen planus episodes, including relapses, but resolve before clinical lichen planus symptoms appear. The other patient (no. 4) with a relapse within 1 month unfortunately refused us a post remission skin sample. On the other hand, the absence of HHV-7 replication in some of our patients could also be explained assuming a multi causal pathogenesis for lichen planus.

] we were able to meet with three out of their seven postulates for the establishment of a causal relationship between HHV-7 and lichen planus. (1) Microbial nucleic acid sequences were present in most cases in diseased sites and not in sites that lack pathology. (2) Fewer nucleic acid sequences were found in hosts without the disease. (3) Nucleic acid sequences correlates were present at a cellular level. The fourth postulate, a decrease of the number of nucleic acid sequences during resolution of the disease and increase with relapse, was met in this study as far as disease resolution is concerned. Unfortunately we did not collect lesional biopsies in those patients that suffered from relapses. HHV-7 reactivation during relapses will have to be investigated in future studies. (5) The number of nucleic acid sequences should correlate with disease severity and (6) reproducibility of the evidence will have to be met in future longitudinal studies. The seventh postulate, clinical features and pathology should be consistent with known biological characteristics of the microbe, will also have to be addressed in future studies since still little is known about the effects of HHV-7 in vivo yet. The hypothesis of HHV-7 as the causative agent for lichen planus deserves further research in larger studies.
