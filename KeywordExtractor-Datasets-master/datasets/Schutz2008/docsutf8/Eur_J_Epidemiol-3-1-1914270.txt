Purpose
To assess inter-scan reproducibility of coronary calcium measurements obtained from Multi Detector-Row CT (MDCT) images and to evaluate whether this reproducibility is affected by different measurement protocols, slice thickness, cardiovascular risk factors and/or technical variables.

Design
Cross-sectional study with repeated measurements.

Materials and methods
The study population comprised 76 healthy women. Coronary calcium was assessed in these women twice in one session using 16-MDCT (Philips Mx 8000 IDT 16). Images were reconstructed with 1.5 mm slice thickness and 3.0 mm slice thickness. The 76 repeated scans were scored. The Agatston score, a volume measurement and a mass measurement were assessed. Reproducibility was determined by estimation of mean, absolute, relative difference, the weighted kappa value for agreement and the Intra-class correlation coefficient (ICCC).

Results
Fifty-five participants (72.4%) had a coronary calcification of more than zero in Agatston (1.5 mm slice thickness). The reproducibility of coronary calcium measurements between scans in terms of ranking was excellent with Intra-class correlation coefficients of >0.98, and kappa values above 0.80. The absolute difference in calcium score between scans increased with increasing calcium levels, indicating that measurement error increases with increasing calcium levels. However, no relation was found between the mean difference in scores and calcium levels, indicating that the increase in measurement error is likely to result in random misclassification in calcium score. Reproducibility results were similar for 1.5 mm slices and for 3.0 mm slices, and equal for Agatston, volume and mass measurements.

Conclusion
Inter-scan reproducibilility of measurement of coronary calcium using images from MDCT is excellent, irrespective of slice thickness and type of calcium parameter.

We set out to study inter-scan reproducibility of coronary calcium measurements from MDCT images and to evaluate whether reproducibility is affected by different measurement protocols, slice thickness, selected cardiovascular risk factors and technical variables.

], cohort of 17,357 healthy breast-cancer screening participants, aged 49–70 years, living in Utrecht and surroundings, enrolled between 1993 and 1997. Between October 2002 and December 2004, a random selection of 1,996 women were invited by mail and 1,000 (50.1%) who were postmenopausal and did not use contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy answered positively. Of these 1,000 women, a random selection of 573 underwent a MDCT examination during a single visit and 76 of them were scanned twice. The Medical Ethical Committee of the University Medical Center Utrecht approved the study and written informed consent was obtained from all participants.

Plasma total cholesterol, plasma triglycerides, and plasma glucose were measured using standard enzymatic procedures. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol was measured by the direct method (inhibition, enzymatic). Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol was calculated using the Friedewald formula.

Coronary imaging and calcium measurements 
The amount of calcium in the coronary arteries was assessed with a Multi Detector-Row CT (MDCT) scanner (Mx 8000 IDT 16, Philips Medical Systems, Best, The Netherlands). Subjects were positioned within the gantry of the MDCT scanner in supine position. During a single breath hold, images of the heart, from the level of the tracheal bifurcation to below the base of the heart, were acquired using prospective ECG triggering at 50–80% of the RR-interval, depending on the heart rate. Scan parameters were 16 × 1.5 mm collimation, 205 mm field of view (FOV), 0.42 s rotation time, 0.28 s scan time per table position, 120 kVp and 40–70 mAs (patient weight <70 kg: 40 mAs; 70–90 kg: 55 mAs; >90 kg: 70 mAs). Scan duration was approximately 10 s, depending on heart rate and patient size. We had the participant get up from the table and lay down again since in studies on change in CAC over one year it is not realistic to assume exactly the same position of the participant at both occasions. Therefore our patients sat up and consequently moved slightly between scans to mimic two separate scan runs.
From the acquired raw data, the whole volume was reconstructed with an intermediate reconstruction algorithm in non-overlapping data sets of 1.5 mm and 3 mm thick sections. Quantification of coronary calcium was performed on a separate workstation with software for calcium scoring (Heartbeat-CS, EBW, Philips Medical Systems, Best, The Netherlands). All regions with a density over 130 Hounsfield units were identified as potential calcifications.

) and mean heart rate (beats/min) during scan acquisition was collected.

Data analysis
The mean and standard deviations (SD) of coronary calcium were calculated for all scoring methods separately. Because of the skewed distribution of scores, medians were also computed. The Intra-class correlation coefficient was estimated for between scans data and for 1.5 and 3.0 mm slices thicknesses separately. The mean difference in score between scans was calculated as well as the absolute and relative differences.
To distinguish between random differences or systematic difference, information on mean and absolute differences is needed. One may assume a priori a non-differential misclassification in the calcium scores, but one has to show that with the results. When the chance of the 2nd result being higher or lower is equal, one would expect a mean difference of zero, with some standard deviation. The absolute difference will not be zero since all differences are ‘absolutised’, but it is expected that at least the mean difference is much less than the absolute difference. If however the chance of a higher or lower value in the 2nd scan is not equal, the mean difference will be plus or minus a certain value. In addition, the absolute difference will have a value close to that of the mean difference. Therefore we need both parameters.

]: A: 0–9 (absent-minimal), B: 10–99 (mild), C: 100–399 (moderate) and D: (400 (severe degree of calcification). This categorization is specifically for the calcium scoring method according to Agatston. Therefore we additionally categorized all scoring methods in their quartiles to calculate kappa as measure of agreement for all scoring methods.

Discussion
With respect to ranking of subjects, the inter-scan reproducibility of coronary calcium measurements by MDCT using Agatston, volume and mass scoring algorithms is excellent. The inter-scan reproducibility showed no major differences between scoring methods. The slice thickness did not affect reproducibility, nor did heart rate and technical parameters. Measurement error was related to increased coronary artery calcification, although our findings suggest that the error in the measurements is a random phenomenon.

] on reproducibility to suggest that “the variability is partially a function of the absolute calcium score and inversely related to it”, implicating that low coronary calcium scores may not be reproducible. However, our results could not confirm this.
17
].
The implications of our main findings depend on the research question that is asked in studies using CAC measurements. When the interest is using CAC measurements for prognostic studies our results for kappa and ICCC show that ranking of subjects is adequate based on one CT scan. So the need for duplicate CAC scan is absent. The fact that measurement error increases with increasing CAC values, is in prognostic studies not of major importance since the categorization of individuals seems adequate. When the interest is in etiologic studies using CAC as outcome parameter, our findings show that risk factor relations will be validly estimated since none of the risk factors relates to measurement error. When the interest is in using CAC as risk factor for future events (assessment of relative risks), it is most likely that in analyses with CAC as continues variable the magnitude of association of high CAC levels with events reflects an underestimation of the true magnitude. The direction of the relation will not change since based on our results measurement error is random, leading to random misclassification of the exposure variable. When the interest is in diagnostic value of CAC measurements, which is usually done in categories of CAC, again the relations will be valid given our high kappa coefficients. Although our study was performed in healthy postmenopausal women, we expect that the finding will also be applicable for men.
Our findings are important in the light of the wider availability of MDCT in countries compared to EBCT. One reason for that is lower equipment cost. Other advantages of MDCT over EBCT have been suggested to be less quantum noise, thinner section thickness, and simultaneous acquisition of four sections (with 16-slice or with 64-slice ), which is reported to reduce misregistration artifact.
In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that coronary calcium measurements by MDCT are highly reproducible and are not affected by scoring protocols, slice thicknesses and technical factors.
