Introduction
Longitudinal studies on the age-related bone loss in men concerns the decrease in areal bone mineral density (aBMD), which can be qualified as “apparent bone loss” because it does not reflect the change in bone mineral content (BMC). Loss of BMC can be referred to as “net bone loss” because it does not take into account the morphological basis of the bone loss (decreased periosteal apposition; endosteal bone loss, i.e. bone loss on the trabecular, endocortical and intracortical surfaces). The aim of this study was to assess age-related apparent net and endosteal bone loss as well as their morphological basis and age-related changes during a prospective follow-up in a large cohort of elderly men.

Methods
This analysis was performed in 725 men aged 51–85 at baseline who were followed up for 90 months.

Results
Bone densitometry was carried out at the lumbar spine, hip and whole body by using the HOLOGIC QDR1500 device and at the distal forearm by using the Osteometer DTX100 device. Sixty-five men who abandoned the study after the first examination were older and had lower aBMC at most sites of measurement. Apparent bone loss was significant at the hip, distal forearm and whole body. Net bone loss was also significant at these sites, except for the femoral neck. Periosteal expansion was significant at all sites of measurement. Apparent and net bone loss accelerated with age, whereas the rate of periosteal expansion remained stable. At the distal radius and ulna, endosteal bone loss accelerated with age, whereas the rate of periosteal apposition remained stable.

Conclusion
In a large cohort of elderly men, age-related apparent bone loss (aBMD) at the hip, distal forearm and whole body was determined by the net bone loss (BMC), except for the femoral neck. Apparent and net bone loss accelerated with age, whereas the periosteal expansion rate (bone widening) remained constant. At the distal forearm, age-related acceleration of the apparent bone loss was determined by the higher endosteal bone loss, whereas the periosteal apposition rate (estimated mass of deposited bone) remained constant.

]. Thus, if the amount of bone deposited on the periosteal surface and that resorbed on the endosteal surfaces (i.e. trabecular, endocortical and intracortical) are equal, BMC remains constant, but aBMD decreases because bone width and its projected area have increased. Therefore, it is more appropriate to refer the decrease in aBMD assessed longitudinally as “apparent bone loss”.
Changes in BMC of a given ROI are determined not only by the quantity of bone resorbed on the endosteal surfaces but also by the quantity of bone deposited on the periosteal surface. Thus, change in BMC does not reflect the quantity of bone really lost on the endosteal surfaces and, therefore, the decrease in BMC is better qualified as “net bone loss”. Estimation of bone gain due to periosteal apposition would allow assessment of the quantity of bone really lost on the endosteal surfaces. This quantity of bone could be referred as to “endosteal bone loss”.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess age-related apparent net and endosteal bone loss as well as their morphological basis and the age-related changes during a long-term prospective follow-up in a large cohort of elderly men (the MINOS study).

]. It is the result of a collaboration between the National Institute of Health and Medical Research (INSERM) and Société de Secours Minière de Bourgogne (SSBM) in Montceau les Mines, a town located 130 km northwest of Lyon in the Department (District) of Saône et Loire. The town has a population of 21,000 inhabitants, including 7,150 men > 19 years if age. SSMB is one of the largest health insurance companies in this town. The study was performed in accord with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975 as revised in 1983. The MINOS cohort consists of 1,040 men aged 19–85 recruited between 1995 and 1998. All men responded to an epidemiological questionnaire covering demographic and behavioural information as well as detailed medical history. Men aged 19–50 were examined once, whereas 790 men aged 50–85 were followed up prospectively for 90 months. Every 18 months, they were invited to attend the follow-up examination composed of an epidemiological questionnaire and DXA measurement. Radiograph of the spine were performed at baseline, 36 and 90 months.

Measurements
aBMD and BMC were measured at the lumbar spine (L2–L4), hip and whole body using pencil-beam DXA (QDR 1500, Hologic Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) and at the distal nondominant forearm using single energy X-ray absorptiometry (Osteometer, DTX-100, Denmark). The OsteoDyne Hip Positioner System (HPS) was used to minimise hip positioning error. ROI of the femoral neck was positioned perpendicularly to the axis of the femoral neck to cover its narrowest part. When necessary, the femoral neck edges were adjusted manually. The QDR 1500 device was calibrated daily using a lumbar spine phantom, yielding a CV for aBMD of 0.33 %. Twice a month, the Hologic hip phantom was measured, yielding a long-term CV of 0.94 % for femoral neck aBMD and 1.05 % for the femoral neck projected area. Also twice a month, a human lumbar spine embedded in methyl methacrylate was measured. Its long-term CV was 1.07 % for BMC of L2–L4, 1.07 % for the projected area of L2–L4, and 0.62 % for aBMD of L2–L4. At the distal forearm, the distal site includes 20 mm of radius situated proximally to the site where the spacing between the medial edge of the radius and the lateral edge of the ulna is 8 mm. Scans with evident error of positioning were excluded. The densitometer was calibrated daily using a calibration standard for DTX 100; its long-term CV was 0.47 % for aBMD and 0.15 % for the projected area.

Statistical methods
All calculations were performed by using SAS version 8.2 software (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). Correlation between continuous variables was assessed by Pearson’s simple correlation coefficient. Individual slopes were calculated by using simple linear regression. Comparisons of the individual slopes between age groups were performed by analysis of variance (ANOVA) and adjusted for multiple comparisons by Dunnett-Hsu test. Participants attended two to six exams; those who had few measurements, e.g. two, had them over different periods of follow-up (18–90 months). Individual slopes were calculated by using two to six points distributed over 18–90 months, which could influence accuracy of the calculation. We adjusted for the duration of follow-up or the number of measurements to check whether duration of follow-up and number of measurements influenced the results. Each of them entered significant in the majority of models, although they influenced the results only to a limited degree. We present data adjusted for the duration of follow-up because this variable attained higher level of significance in the models and contributed more to the final model.

External diameter of the femoral neck, distal radius and distal ulna as well as the cross-sectional area of L3 and the projected area of total hip increased significantly during the follow-up. Fractional increase in bone size varied from 0.17% to 0.36% per year across the sites.

]. Both apparent and net bone loss accelerated with ageing; by contrast, periosteal apposition remained constant. Thus, age-related acceleration of the apparent and net bone loss is determined by the acceleration of bone loss on endosteal surfaces. Apparent and net bone loss were significant in all age groups.

]. However, in men also, age-related increase in endosteal bone loss is not accompanied by an increase in periosteal apposition that would offset the possible loss of strength. Periosteal apposition does not adapt to the endosteal bone loss and remains stable. This imbalance may result in a decrease of bone strength. Thus, in men also, osteoporosis seems to be a disease of failed adaptation.

Our study has limitations. Montceau les Mines is a small town, and its inhabitants may not be representative of the French population. The response rate for the invitation was 23%. Men who abandoned the study after the first examination were older and sicker, although they represent only 8% of the initial cohort. Men who were followed up may have been healthier than the general population, especially in the oldest group. However, this difference would have underestimated the age-related bone loss and its age-related acceleration. A number of men had lower number of DXA scans because they did not attend examinations regularly or abandoned the study before the end of the follow-up. A low number of DXA values and shorter follow-up could influence the accuracy of estimation of slopes. However, adjustment for the follow-up duration or the number of scans did not influence the results.
DXA presents limitations in the evaluation of bone width. In very old men, subperiosteal bone mass can be low and not recognised by the edge-detection system. This artefact can underestimate the bone width in elderly men and the age-related increase in bone width mainly in the cross-sectional studies (where the age range is large) but less so in the longitudinal study (where the follow-up period is shorter). The projected area of femoral neck may be overestimated because of calcifications in fibrous tissue. The measured radius site is established by the device. According to the individual anatomy, this site may be more distal (larger and more trabecular) or more proximal (narrower and cortical). Again, this artefact may introduce a bias mainly in cross-sectional studies.
Calculation of endosteal bone loss is indirect and based on the assumptions such as uniform bone flattening, constant subperiosteal bone vBMD and proportional periosteal expansion in all axes. By contrast, the advantage of this concept is that we do not make any assumption on the morphological basis underlying the endosteal bone loss (cortical thinning or trabecular bone loss, proportion of cortical to trabecular bone, similar or different rates of trabecular and cortical bone loss, etc.). Finally, our calculation of endosteal bone loss was carried out for the predominantly cortical sites and, although globally consistent with the cross-sectional data obtained by hr-pQCT, may not necessarily apply for the predominantly trabecular sites.
In conclusion, in a large cohort of elderly men, age-related apparent bone loss (aBMD) at the hip, distal forearm and whole body was determined by the net bone loss (BMC), except for the femoral neck. Apparent and net bone loss accelerated with age, whereas the periosteal expansion rate (widening of ROI) remained constant. At the distal forearm, age-related acceleration of the apparent bone loss was determined by the higher endosteal bone loss, whereas the periosteal apposition rate (estimated mass of deposited bone) remained constant.
