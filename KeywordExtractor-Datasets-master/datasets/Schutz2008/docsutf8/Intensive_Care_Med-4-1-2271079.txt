Objective
To determine to what extent patients who have survived abdominal sepsis suffer from symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression, and to identify potential risk factors for PTSD symptoms.

Design and setting
PTSD and depression symptoms were measured using the Impact of Events Scale–Revised (IES-R), the Post-Traumatic Symptom Scale 10 (PTSS-10) and the Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II).

Patients and participants
A total of 135 peritonitis patients were eligible for this study, of whom 107 (80%) patients completed the questionnaire. The median APACHE-II score was 14 (range 12–16), and 89% were admitted to the ICU.

Measurements and results

Conclusion
As many as 38% of patients after abdominal sepsis report elevated levels of PTSD symptoms on at least one of the questionnaires. Our nomogram may assist in identifying patients at increased risk for developing symptoms of PTSD.

Therefore, our aims were to determine the presence and level of symptoms of PTSD in patients surviving abdominal sepsis. In addition, we searched for demographic and disease-related factors associated with higher levels of PTSD symptoms. Identification of such factors may be important to determine possible targets of intervention and to select patients for psychological assessment interviews.

Methods
Study design
Our study was embedded in an ongoing randomized clinical trial (the RELAP Trial) evaluating two surgical treatment strategies for patients with secondary peritonitis after the initial emergency laparotomy. Patients were enrolled between December 2001 and February 2005 in two academic medical centers and seven regional teaching hospitals in The Netherlands. All patients were followed up for 12 months after initial (index) laparotomy.
The study was approved by the medical ethics committee of the Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam. All patients gave informed consent to participate in this study.

Study population

Data collection
All self-administered PTSD questionnaires were distributed by mail to patients who survived at least 12 months following initial emergency laparotomy, with a reminder by phone within 2 weeks in the case of no response. After 1 month without response a new questionnaire including a reminder letter was sent.

]. Patients scored the frequency of traumatic memories of their stay in the ICU or hospital ward using a four-point scale of 0 (never), 1 (sometimes), 2 (regularly) or 3 (often), administered concurrently with the PTSS-10 and IES-R questionnaires after at least 12 months' follow-up. These were subsequently summed and classified into three graded categories of traumatic memories: 0 (no traumatic memories), 1–4 (some traumatic memories), more than 4 (many traumatic memories).

In addition, a factor comprised of other non-related traumas that the patient had experienced within the previous 3 years was included in the final model to assess its potential confounding role.
The fit and validity of the model was evaluated by checking the discriminatory properties (overlap in risk scores of patients with different outcomes), the proportional odds assumption (test for parallel lines) and calibration (closeness in expected and observed numbers of patients evaluated by an extension of the Hosmer–Lemeshow goodness-of-fit statistic).

].
Nomogram: A nomogram was developed to visualize the prognostic strength of the different factors from the multivariate model in a single diagram. A nomogram allows readers to calculate an expected distribution of PTSD symptomatology (‘low-scoring’, ‘moderate-scoring’ and ‘high-scoring’ patients) based on a specific profile of a patient. The number of points for each predictor was based on the original coefficient from the multivariate ordinal model. The total number of points derived by specifying values for all predictors was used to calculate the expected probabilities that a patient would be a ‘low-scoring patient’, a ‘moderate-scoring patient’ or a ‘high-scoring patient’.
Analyses were performed using SAS software version 9.1 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).

]. Secondary peritonitis in itself may have been severe enough, with ICU admission and extended mechanical ventilation days, to cause PTSD symptoms; therefore, the added risk by ARDS may be moot. Lack of power may also be a factor, because the proportion of patients developing ARDS in this study was modest.

]. Hydrocortisone did not protect against developing PTSD symptoms, whereas other studies have found that administration of hydrocortisone during ICU can lead to a reduction in PTSD symptoms after discharge. In this study corticosteroid use during only the first 14 days of ICU was included in our analyses. The effect of prolonged use of hydrocortisone or late-stage use during conditional adrenal insufficiency cannot be excluded.

], to account for possible earlier traumas we considered information pertaining to comorbid diseases. Furthermore, we collected data on other, non-disease-related traumatic events that had occurred within the previous 3 years. These non-disease-related events were indeed associated with having more PTSD symptoms, and altered the initial ORs of the other factors to the extent that we considered it a moderate confounder.

In the clinical setting, there is a continuing debate on whether to intervene in the more acute peritraumatic psychological processes or in a later phase, when symptoms or prodromes of PTSD are observed. By improving our understanding of which factors play an important role in the development of PTSD, we can better prevent PTSD symptoms in high-risk patients and decide when best to intervene. The aim of our predictive model is for it to be used by treating physicians, following the acute episode and phase of secondary peritonitis in which survival and physical recovery are the main concerns, to recognize high-risk PTSD patients. This relatively simple model can aid the surgeon, for instance, during the first outpatient visit in determining which patients are at higher risk for the development of PTSD symptoms. However, before this nomogram can be used to actually predict PTSD symptomatology in clinical practice, it must be externally validated in another cohort of patients with secondary peritonitis.
In conclusion, 10% of peritonitis patients report ‘high’ PTSD symptomatology and another 28% ‘moderate’ PTSD symptoms. Factors that were related to more PTSD symptoms included younger age, traumatic memories of the period of hospitalization and length of ICU stay. Knowledge of these predictive factors is required to increase awareness, and to develop tailored early treatment options for these high-risk patients our nomogram may assist in identifying patients with PTSD symptoms.
