Candidatus “Aciduliprofundum boonei”
, the only cultivated representative of archaea falling in the DHVE2 phylogenetic cluster, a group of microorganisms ubiquitously occurring at hydrothermal vents, was studied. The predominant core membrane lipids in this thermophilic euryarchaeote were found to be composed of glycerol dibiphytanyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGTs) containing 0–4 cyclopentyl moieties. In addition, GDGTs with an additional covalent bond between the isoprenoid hydrocarbon chains, so-called H-shaped GDGTs, were present. The latter core lipids have been rarely reported previously. Intact polar lipid analysis revealed that they predominantly consist of GDGTs with a phospho-glycerol headgroup.

). Cells were harvested at late log phase of growth. Cell pellets were freeze-dried and stored frozen until analysis.

Core lipid analysis

 was hydrolyzed by refluxing in ca. 4 ml 1 M KOH in methanol for 1 h. The pH of the hydrolyzed extract was adjusted to pH 3 using 2 M HCl/methanol (MeOH) 1/1 (v/v) and transferred to a separatory funnel. The residual cell material was washed subsequently with 2 ml MeOH/water 1/1 (v/v), MeOH and dichloromethane (DCM, three times). The washings and 6 ml bidistilled water were added to the separatory funnel, which was shaken vigorously. The DCM layer was removed and the residual water/MeOH layer was re-extracted two times using DCM. The combined DCM layers were dried using a sodium sulfate column to yield the hydrolyzed extract. The extract released upon hydrolysis was condensed by rotary evaporation. Elemental sulphur was removed with activated Cu. The extract was methylated by diazomethane and filtered over a silicagel column using ethyl acetate. One aliquot of the eluate was silylated using BSTFA (with 1% TMCS) in pyridine (1/1, v/v) for 20 min at 60°C and subsequently analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) and GC/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Another aliquot of the eluate was dissolved in hexane/isopropanol (99:1, v/v), ultrasonicated and filtered using a PTFE 0.45-μm filter prior to analysis for GDGTs on the high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)/MS.
