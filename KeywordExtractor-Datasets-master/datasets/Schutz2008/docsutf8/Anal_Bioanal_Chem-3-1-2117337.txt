This report describes a versatile and robust microreactor for bioactive proteins physically immobilized on a polyether sulfone filter. The potential of the reactor is illustrated with glucose oxidase immobilized on a filter with a cut-off value of 30 kDa. A flow-injection system was used to deliver the reactants and the device was linked on-line to an electrochemical detector. The microreactor was used for on-line preparation of apoglucose oxidase in strong acid and its subsequent reactivation with flavin adenine dinucleotide. In addition we describe a miniaturized version of the microreactor used to assess several characteristics of femtomole to attomole amounts of glucose oxidase. A low negative potential over the electrodes was used when ferrocene was the mediator in combination with horseradish peroxidase, ensuring the absence of oxidation of electro-active compounds in biological fluids. A low backpressure at very low flow rates is an advantage, which increases the sensitivity. A variety of further applications of the microreactor are suggested.

], is robust, easy to handle, and loss of activity and consumption of enzyme are kept to a minimum. With this device we were able to prepare apoGOx on-line by retaining GOx on a single polyether sulfone (PES) filter using acid treatment. Restoration of the enzyme activity was achieved in the same system using a solution of FAD. Furthermore, we were able to miniaturize the microreactor, using less enzyme, and increase the sensitivity of the system using a combination of ferrocene and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) as a mediator for electrochemical detection.
