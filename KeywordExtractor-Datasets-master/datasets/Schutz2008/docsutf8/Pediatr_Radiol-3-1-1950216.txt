Increasingly, radiologists are encouraged to have protocols for all imaging studies and to include imaging guidelines in care pathways set up by the referring clinicians. This is particularly advantageous in MRI where magnet time is limited and a radiologist’s review of each patient’s images often results in additional sequences and longer scanning times without the advantage of improvement in diagnostic ability. The difficulties of imaging small children and the challenges presented to the radiologist as the brain develops are discussed. We present our protocols for imaging the brain and spine of children based on 20 years experience of paediatric neurological MRI. The protocols are adapted to suit children under the age of 2 years, small body parts and paediatric clinical scenarios.

Introduction
The use of imaging protocols allows the standardization of procedures and workflow as well as consistency of image quality. With appropriate training, radiographers can select and implement imaging protocols with relatively little requirement for radiological involvement. This use of skill mix provides radiographers with an expanded role and greater responsibility that increases job satisfaction and staff retention.
Imaging protocols can also provide guidance for radiologists and radiographers for patients in shared care between secondary and tertiary care institutions. The use of protocols set up by the referring centre will prevent repeat MR scanning with the additional burden on MR scanner time. These advantages are offset by the minor disadvantage that radiologists’ personal preferences and the intricacies of individual scanners are not taken into consideration.
At Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH), MRI protocols have been implemented for nearly 20 years and have been modified as scanners are replaced and new sequences developed. Our success is measured by the minimal number of patients recalled (less than 1%). Increasingly, we are asked about our MR protocols by departments throughout the United Kingdom and have set them out here to make them freely available to those who may find them beneficial to patient care. The protocols provided are confined to conventional imaging techniques and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and do not include the advanced imaging techniques of perfusion imaging, diffusion tensor imaging and MR spectroscopy that remain largely within the research domain.

Practical issues of MRI in children

].
Commercial MR machines are designed for adult practice and few manufacturers make provision for the issues encountered in paediatric practice. Currently, most children are imaged in units that have a wider adult practice with only a handful of institutions throughout the world having dedicated paediatric MR facilities. The structures we need to examine in children are generally small and we aim for a maximum slice thickness of 5 mm in the brain and 3 mm in the spine. The slice thickness is reduced to 3 mm when acquiring images of the pituitary gland and orbits.
We do not recommend ultrafast ‘breath-hold’-type T2-weighted (T2-W) sequences that have reduced contrast to noise as an alternative to sedating a child, as achieving high contrast to noise is of utmost importance given the small size of the paediatric head. Advances in coil design have improved signal-to-noise and we now use multichannel head and spine coils.

]. Failure to appreciate the normal changes with age of the ADC will result in the erroneous reporting of white matter abnormality particularly in the neonatal period.

Factors influencing sequence choice
For any imaging protocol, it is the specific combination of sequences that determines the diagnostic efficacy of the examination. It is clear that imaging protocols vary between institutions. This is largely because rapid advances in imaging technology and variations between manufacturers, applied in the context of investigating relatively rare disorders, precludes an effective evidence-based approach to sequence choice.
The main advantages that MRI offers over alternative imaging modalities is the ability to demonstrate different tissue contrasts (principally T1-W, T2-W and spin density, but also flow and diffusion) in multiple imaging planes (principally sagittal, coronal and axial). The disadvantage of MRI is the artefacts that it generates in almost every image.
The choice of sequence combination should reflect the multicontrast and multiplanar capabilities of MRI. We have found that applying the generic principle of combining T2-W images in two planes, supported by T1-W imaging in two planes, as the basis of our imaging protocols, serves to optimize the benefits of MRI whilst minimizing the impact of artefacts.

Standard MRI studies
Brain
9
]. DWI is acquired in all children unless artefacts from, for example, dental braces or a ventriculoperitoneal shunt, preclude it, and an ADC is calculated using automated computer software and provided for reporting.
In those under 2 years of age, the T2-W sequence is replaced by a dual-echo axial STIR sequence (see above). In some cases, a T2*-W gradient-echo (GE) sequence (“susceptibility-weighted” sequence), sensitive to changes in local field inhomogeneity caused by the breakdown products of haemoglobin, is added. The sequence is particularly useful in trauma and vascular malformations such as multiple cavernomas.

Spine
10
].
Our standard spine imaging includes sagittal, fast spin-echo T1- and T2-W sequences (3-mm-thick slices). Both axial T1-W and T2-W images are acquired through any abnormality. Unlike most adult spine imaging protocols, groups of axial images through disc levels are not applied because degenerative disc disease is rare. Children with scoliosis and/or suspected spinal dysraphism routinely have axial T1-W images through the conus and filum terminale to detect lipomas of the filum terminale that may not be visible on sagittal imaging.

MRI protocols for specific areas
The strategies applied to the brain are also applied to small parts such as the orbits and pituitary gland. The orbit is scanned using a STIR sequence to benefit from the fat saturation properties of the sequence and improve the conspicuity of lesions within the orbit. The slice thickness is reduced to 3 mm and, to increase the signal-to-noise, the matrix size is reduced, thereby slightly reducing the in-plane resolution.
A heavily T2-W 3-D volume sequence of the petrous temporal bones is used to image the membranous labyrinth and is reconstructed in the coronal plane of the petrous temporal bone, and the axial and sagittal plane of the internal auditory meati (IAM). The sagittal plane is used to view the vestibulocochlear nerve in cross section. A constructive interference steady state sequence (CISS), available on Siemens scanners, is acquired and reconstructed at a slice thickness of 0.7 mm. The GE equivalent is the FIESTA sequence and the Philips equivalent is DRIVE.

MRI protocols for specific neurological or neurosurgical presentations
The majority of children undergoing an MRI brain scan will have epilepsy, stroke or a brain tumour and are often referred to specialists with an interest in these areas.
Tumours of the brain and spine
Brain
11
]. One of the commonest reasons for repeat scanning of a child with a brain tumour is the acquisition of contrast-enhanced imaging of the spine in a child who has had only a brain scan at the referring centre.
The purpose of preoperative imaging of brain tumours is to assess tumour location and type, establish whether there are single or multiple lesions, define its relationship with vital structures and look for any complications such as hydrocephalus. Contrast-enhanced T1-W volumetric acquisitions are also acquired for image-guided surgery.
Imaging of the spine is performed in all children with intracranial tumours (not only posterior fossa tumours) and although this requires a change of coil and an additional sequence, we find it beneficial as tumour histology is often not certain at the time of the initial imaging. Some tumours unexpectedly metastasize to the spine and assessment of the postoperative spine is made more difficult in the presence of blood products.
11
]. If preoperative spinal imaging has not been acquired, the spine is imaged with both unenhanced and contrast-enhanced T1-W imaging to enable differentiation between haematoma and tumour metastases.

Epilepsy
16
]. In children with epilepsy we are aiming to detect focal cortical abnormalities; the majority are extratemporal and in a smaller proportion they are mesial temporal in origin. The majority of cortical abnormalities are easily diagnosed using conventional brain imaging and our standard brain protocol is used to investigate these children. The acquisition of a coronal T2-W sequence (either STIR, T2-W or FLAIR) allows the visualization of the mesial temporal lobe, and is a sequence often not acquired in referring centres.

Non-traumatic intraparenchymal haemorrhage
18
]. An attempt is made to perform MRI within 72 h of the ictus to overcome the problem of the visibility of blood products (T1 shortening due to methaemoglobin) on 3-D TOF sequences that may obscure the underlying pathology. The value of intravenous contrast agents in identifying underlying vascular causes has not been proven. We have a largely anecdotal view that it is helpful in identifying small AVMs and venous anomalies.

Stroke
19
19
]. Specific entities such as moyamoya disease may also be diagnosed. The commonest abnormality identified is occlusion or stenosis, of unknown aetiology, affecting the terminal internal carotid artery (ICA) or proximal middle cerebral artery (MCA).
20
]. The inversion time of the STIR sequence is selected to suppress the fat within the neck. The fat saturation provided by both these sequences improves the conspicuity of the haematoma within the extracranial vessel wall.
A 3-D TOF MRA sequence is used for the imaging of the intracranial vessels and a 2-D TOF MRA sequence for the extracranial vessels. The TOF scan times are shorter than phase-contrast (PC) MRA and there is lack of dependence on the choice of correct velocity encoding with obvious advantages when scanning ill children. Intracranial 3-D TOF MRA is also included in the investigation of children with IPH, although its sensitivity to T1 shortening may obscure the underlying abnormality (see above).
As CT is often the first-line investigation in children with stroke, the potential of DWI to detect hyperacute cerebral infarction prior to changes on T2-W MRI is not realized. However, inpatients (e.g. cardiac patients, patients with recent-onset stroke) can be imaged early, and in these children DWI can be used to detect infarcts of different ages.

Non-accidental head injury
21
]. The rationale for performing MRI is that it is more sensitive than CT to both hypoxic–ischaemic injury, particularly when DWI is used, and subdural haematomas adjacent to the calvarium or in the posterior fossa. MRI is repeated at 2–3 months in those children with parenchymal brain injury or a persistent neurological abnormality.
22

].

Neonatal imaging
Conventional imaging can detect patterns of regional brain injury in the neonatal period that can help time the injury, determine underlying mechanisms and ultimately provide some prognostic information. MRI is useful in detecting hypoxic–ischaemic injury, and germinal matrix and intraventricular haemorrhage, and can be useful to distinguish other pathologies that may mimic hypoxic–ischaemic encephalopathy in the neonatal period such as venous infarction, metabolic disease, infection, and congenital developmental abnormalities.
Our neonatal imaging protocol is the same as the under-2-year brain protocol. Achieving high signal-to-noise is of utmost importance given the small size of the infant head and is improved by decreasing the slice thickness to 4 mm whilst decreasing the matrix size from 512 × 512 to 256 × 256 in a field-of-view of 180 mm. Although specific neonatal head coils have been developed, most nonpaediatric centres are unlikely to have access to them and improved results can be obtained by using an adult knee coil.

Developmental delay
Developmental delay, without other clinical features such as epilepsy or dysmorphic features, is not considered an indication for an MRI scan at our institution. This decision was made in conjunction with our neurologists as it was recognized that there is an extremely low yield of clinically relevant abnormalities seen in patients with developmental delay alone.


The future
The future of paediatric neuroimaging lies in the incorporation of research techniques, such as perfusion imaging and diffusion tensor imaging, into standard imaging protocols once they have been demonstrated to be of value within the clinical arena. The use of higher field strength magnets will have the advantage of increasing signal-to-noise and reducing scanning time, which will be of benefit to the child who is both small and liable to move.
