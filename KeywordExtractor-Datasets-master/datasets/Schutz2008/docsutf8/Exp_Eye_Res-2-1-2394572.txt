Abstract
dl
-alpha-aminoadipic acid (AAA). Dissociated early post-natal neural retinal cells were transplanted via subretinal injection at various time-points after AAA administration. At 3 weeks post-injection, the number of integrated, differentiated photoreceptor cells was assessed and compared with those found in the PBS-treated contralateral eye. We demonstrate for the first time that the OLM can be reversibly disrupted in adult mice, using a specific dose of AAA administered by intravitreal injection. In this model, OLM disruption is maximal at 72 h, and recovers by 2 weeks. When combined with cell transplantation, disruption of the OLM leads to a significant increase in the number of photoreceptors integrated within the ONL compared with PBS-treated controls. This effect was only seen in animals in which AAA had been administered 72 h prior to transplantation, i.e. when precursor cells were delivered into the subretinal space at a time coincident with maximal OLM disruption. These findings suggest that the OLM presents a physical barrier to photoreceptor integration following transplantation into the subretinal space in the adult mouse. Reversible disruption of the OLM may provide a strategy for increasing cell integration in future therapeutic applications.

Introduction
Retinal degeneration is the leading cause of untreatable blindness in the developed world. Current clinical treatments are limited, at best only slowing disease progression and very rarely restoring visual function. Cell transplantation offers a novel therapeutic approach, enabling the replacement of photoreceptor cells lost in the degenerative process. Photoreceptor transplantation may be more feasible than other types of neuronal transplantation, because photoreceptors are stimulated by light and their function is not, therefore, dependent on the reformation of complex afferent connections. Nevertheless, an efferent connection to host second order sensory neurons in the retina is essential for visual function and this is arguably best achieved if the transplanted photoreceptor is fully integrated into the host outer nuclear layer (ONL).

), it is likely that natural physical barriers, such as the OLM, impede migration. Transient disruption of these barriers at the time of transplantation might be one way of increasing the number integrating into the host retina.

). In this study, we show that by using an appropriate dose and route of administration, AAA can produce a transient disruption in OLM integrity. Furthermore, OLM disruption can facilitate movement of cells in the opposite direction, significantly enhancing the number of donor photoreceptors integrated into the recipient ONL after transplantation into the subretinal space. These findings suggest that the OLM represents at least one important barrier to cell integration.

α-Aminoadipic acid formulation and administration
dl
-α-Aminoadipic acid (AAA; Sigma) was prepared in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), adjusted to pH 7.5 and sterile-filtered prior to administration. Mice were anaesthetized with a single intra-peritoneal injection of 0.15 ml of a mixture of Dormitor (1 mg/ml medetomidine hydrochloride; Pfizer Pharmaceuticals, Kent UK), ketamine (100 mg/ml; Fort Dodge Animal Health, Southampton, UK) and sterile water for injections in the ratio of 5:3:42 for adult mice. AAA was administered by intravitreal, subretinal or subcutaneous injection.
For histological assessment, mice were sacrificed at various time points (3–4 mice per time-point) and the eyes were fixed in buffered formalin for 48 h at 4 °C. Retinal sections were prepared by overnight dehydration and paraffin embedding (Histocentre). Sections (5 μm thick) were cut and affixed to glass slides and stained using standard haematoxylin and eosin protocols.

Retinal sections were prepared by cryo-protecting fixed eyes in 20% sucrose, before cryo-embedding in OCT (TissueTek) and sectioning at 18 μm.

The number of apoptotic cells was determined by counting all TUNEL-positive profiles in each layer of the retina in alternate serial sections. Only sections that encompassed the site of intravitreal injection were used and are thus not representative of apoptosis in the whole eye.

However, intravitreal administration caused modest and reversible morphological changes (see below). Therefore, AAA was administered to the retina via intravitreal injection, through the inferior pars plana towards the superior hemisphere of the eye, for the remainder of the experiments described.

By 48 h, the laminar organization of the retina was disrupted and more photoreceptors were displaced from the ONL. Some retinal folds were evident at 72 h post-injection and the organization of the inner and outer segments was significantly disrupted. Recovery of the retina was first seen at 1 week post AAA injection, as lamination returned and photoreceptor inner and outer segments regained nearly normal orientation. Photoreceptor organization appeared largely normal by 2 weeks post injection.

Discussion
Here we demonstrate that the OLM in the adult mouse retina can be transiently disrupted by the intravitreal administration of AAA. OLM disruption is maximal approximately 72 h post administration. When combined with precursor cell transplantation, this time point correlates with a significantly enhanced level of transplanted photoreceptor cell integration into the recipient ONL, compared with sham-injected controls. These findings suggest that the OLM represents a natural barrier to the successful integration of photoreceptor precursor cells transplanted into the subretinal space. Consideration of the OLM may therefore be important in any future clinical photoreceptor transplantation strategies directed towards retinal repair.

). This suggests that if cells can exit the ONL following disruption of the OLM, the converse is also likely—cells in the subretinal space can migrate more readily into the ONL when the OLM is disrupted. Accordingly, pre-treatment with AAA leads to significantly greater numbers of donor cells integrating following transplantation, compared with controls. Importantly, this effect was only seen if cells were transplanted 72 h after AAA administration, i.e. only when OLM disruption is at its peak.

Based on the results of our experiments, it is therefore not inconceivable that the OLM disruption resulting from CME may make the diseased human fovea a particularly favourable site for future retinal cell transplantation strategies.

Fig. 1
The outer limiting membrane. (a) Semithin section of a wildtype mouse retina, stained with Toluidine Blue showing the location of the outer limiting membrane (OLM). Scale bar, 50 μm. Electron micrograph of the highlighted area shows the electron dense adherens junctions (black arrow head) that form the OLM (insert below). (b) Single confocal image of a retinal section from an Nrl.gfp (green) mouse, stained for zonula occludins-1 (ZO-1; red), an adherens junction protein. Nuclei were counterstained with Hoechst 33342 (blue). Scale bar, 20 μm. (c) Schematic diagram illustrating the adherens junctions (red) that form the OLM, between the cells of the mammalian retina (green photoreceptors; grey Müller cells; blue nuclei). An enlargement of an adherens junction demonstrates the presence of the actin binding protein ZO-1 at the OLM (insert). (d) The chemical structure of alpha-aminoadipic acid (AAA) showing its similarity to glutamate. ILM, inner limiting membrane; GCL, ganglion cell layer; IPL, inner plexiform layer; INL, inner nuclear layer; OPL, outer plexiform layer; ONL, outer nuclear layer; OLM, outer limiting membrane; IS, inner segments; OS, outer segments; RPE, retinal pigment epithelium.

The effect of AAA on adult wildtype retinal morphology. Light images of Haemotoxylin and Eosin (H&E) stained retinal sections from wildtype mice treated with 20 μg, 100 μg and 320 μg of AAA. Mice were sacrificed at 6 h, 24 h and 3 weeks post AAA intravitreal injection. (a, d, g) Vacuoles were present at 6 h post AAA administration in all doses (black arrow heads). (b, c) The retina recovered normal morphology by 24 h, post 20 μg AAA injection. (e, h) Displaced photoreceptor cell bodies suggested outer limiting membrane disruption at 24 h, post 100 μg and 320 μg AAA administration (white arrow heads). (f) Recovery of the retina was observed 3 weeks post 100 μg AAA injection, with a few remaining vacuoles between the outer segments (white arrow). (i) Disruption of the inner limiting membrane (black arrow), loss of retinal layers and degeneration of the photoreceptor inner/outer segments (white arrow), was present 3 weeks post 320 μg AAA injection. Highlighted sections are shown magnified to the right. ILM, inner limiting membrane; GCL, ganglion cell layer; IPL, inner plexiform layer; INL, inner nuclear layer; OPL, outer plexiform layer; ONL, outer nuclear layer; OLM, outer limiting membrane; IS/OS, inner and outer segments; RPE, retinal pigment epithelium. Scale bars, 20 μm.



Fig. 3
Intravitreal administration of AAA causes transient disruption of the outer limiting membrane. Single confocal images of retinal sections from Nrl-GFP (green) (a) and wildtype (b, c) mice treated with AAA (100 μg) 24, 48, 72 h, 1 and 2 weeks prior to sacrifice. (a) Images show sequential displacement of photoreceptors towards the subretinal space (white arrowheads). The peak of disruption occurred at 72 h and ceased after 1 week post AAA intravitreal injection. (b) Sequential staining for ZO-1 (red), an adherens junction protein, demonstrates some outer limiting membrane disruption at 24 and 48 h, and maximal disruption at 72 h post AAA administration (white arrows). (c) Apoptotic cells, demonstrated by sequential TUNEL staining (red; white horizontal arrows). Nuclei were counterstained with Hoechst 33342 (blue). GCL, ganglion cell layer; INL, inner nuclear layer; ONL, outer nuclear layer; OLM, outer limiting membrane; IS/OS, inner and outer segments. Scale bars, 20 μm.



Fig. 4
Ultrastructural recovery of the outer limiting membrane 1 week post AAA administration. Electron micrographs of retinal sections from PBS and AAA treated wildtype mice, sacrificed at 72 h (a, b) and 1 week (c) post intravitreal injection. (a) Normal retinal structure was observed in the PBS treated retina and continuous electron dense adherens junctions were present (insert). (b) Disrupted retinal lamination was observed at 72 h post AAA administration. Mislocalized photoreceptors (black arrow heads) and vacuoles (white arrow heads) were present in the segment layer, and a lack of adherens junctions was seen (black arrows and insert). (c) Relatively normal retinal structure was observed 1 week post AAA administration. A few vacuoles remained in the segment layer (white arrow heads) and almost continuous adherens junctions were present (insert). Contrast stained. ONL, outer nuclear layer; OLM, outer limiting membrane; IS, inner segments; OS, outer segments; RPE, retinal pigment epithelium. Scale bars, 5 μm; insert scale bars, 2 μm.
