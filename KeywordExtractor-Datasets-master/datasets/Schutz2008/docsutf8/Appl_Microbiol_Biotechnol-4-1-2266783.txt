 strain IF1 was able to mineralize 4-FP up to concentrations of 5 mM in batch culture. Stoichiometric release of fluoride ions was observed, suggesting that there is no formation of halogenated dead-end products during 4-FP metabolism. The degradative pathway of 4-FP was investigated using enzyme assays and identification of intermediates by gas chromatography (GC), GC–mass spectrometry (MS), high-performance liquid chromatography, and liquid chromatography–MS. Cell-free extracts of 4-FP-grown cells contained no activity for catechol 1,2-dioxygenase or catechol 2,3-dioxygenase, which indicates that the pathway does not proceed through a catechol intermediate. Cells grown on 4-FP oxidized 4-FP, hydroquinone, and hydroxyquinol but not 4-fluorocatechol. During 4-FP metabolism, hydroquinone accumulated as a product. Hydroquinone could be converted to hydroxyquinol, which was further transformed into maleylacetic acid and β-ketoadipic acid. These results indicate that the biodegradation of 4-FP starts with a 4-FP monooxygenase reaction that yields benzoquinone, which is reduced to hydroquinone and further metabolized via the β-ketoadipic acid pathway.

). None of these organisms could utilize fluorophenols as a growth substrate.
To our knowledge, studies on the metabolism of fluorophenols by a bacterial culture that is capable of using such as compound as a sole source of carbon and energy have not been reported. In the present paper, we describe the isolation and characterization of a bacterial strain growing on 4-FP as the sole source of carbon and energy. Based on the identification of several intermediates, a metabolic route for the degradation of 4-FP by this strain is proposed.

Enrichment and isolation of 4-FP-degrading cultures
 A variety of soil samples, collected from different sites in The Netherlands that are contaminated with halogenated aliphatic compounds (such as monochlorobenzene, hexachlorobenzene, and trichloropropane), were used as the initial inoculum for the 4-FP enrichments. The soil samples were used to inoculate flasks containing 30 ml of sterile minimal salts medium and 1 mM of 4-FP, supplied in the liquid phase as the sole carbon and energy source. The cultures were incubated at room temperature on a rotary shaker (150 rpm), and 40% of the suspension was transferred to a new flask containing fresh medium every 15 days. During this time, growth (optical density at 600 nm) and liberation of fluoride were monitored. Samples of the enrichment culture were periodically spread onto minimal salts agar plates containing 1 mM 4-FP and onto NB plates as soon as growth on 4-FP was established. Pure cultures were obtained by repetitive streaking onto solid MM containing 4-FP and tested separately for growth on 1 mM 4-FP liquid medium. Growth and fluoride release were again monitored to verify 4-FP degradation. Strains capable of 4-FP degradation as a sole source of carbon and energy were used for further experiments. Strain IF1 was deposited at Centraalbureau voor Schimmelcultures, Utrecht, The Netherlands, under accession number NCCB 100218.

Enzyme assays
 Catechol 1,2-dioxygenase and catechol 2,3-dioxygenase activities were measured spectrophotometrically at 260 and 375 nm, respectively. The reaction mixtures contained 0.1 mM catechol, TD buffer, and cell-free extract (0.1 mg of protein) in a final volume of 1 ml. 4-Fluorocatechol 1,2-dioxygenase was measured as catechol 1,2-dioxygenase but with 4-fluorocatechol instead of catechol as the substrate.
The 4-FP monooxygenase activity was measured spectrophotometrically by following the consumption of NADH at 340 nm in a reaction mixture containing cell-free extract (0.1 mg protein), 0.1 mM 4-FP, 0.1 mM NADH, and buffer in a total volume of 1 ml. The observed rates were corrected for substrate-independent NADH oxidation.

Hydroquinone dioxygenase was assayed spectrophotometrically by monitoring the change in absorbance between 230 and 330 nm in a reaction mixture of 1 ml final volume containing 0.1 mM hydroquinone, TD buffer, and cell-free extract (0.1 mg of protein). Hydroquinone hydroxylase and hydroxyquinol dioxygenase were assayed by using a fiber optic oxygen sensor. Reaction mixtures contained 1 mM of substrate, MM, and cell suspension (0.5 mg/ml protein) in a final volume of 1.25 ml.

 consumption was measured with a fiber optic oxygen sensor (MOPS-1, ProSense BV, Hannover, Germany). All reactions were performed in a stirred vessel at room temperature. The reaction mixtures contained 1 mM of substrate (4-FP, hydroquinone, 4-fluorocatechol, hydroxyquinol, or catechol), MM, and cell suspension (0.5 mg/ml protein) in a final volume of 1.25 ml.
Analytical methods
 For capillary gas chromatography (GC), 4 ml samples were extracted with 1 ml of diethyl ether. A model 6890 gas chromatograph (Hewlett-Packard) equipped with a flame ionization detector and a HP-5 column (Agilent 19091J-413, 30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm) were used for the analysis. GC-mass spectrometry (MS) analysis was carried out with a model 5973 mass selective detector (Hewlett-Packard) coupled to a HP 6890 series injector and a HP1 column (Agilent 19091Z-433; 30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm). High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was carried out using a Chrompack C18 column (10 cm × 5 mm) connected to a Jasco UV-1575 detector, which monitored absorbance at 214 and 254 nm, and operated with Jasco PU-980 pumps and a Jasco AS-1555 sampler. The mobile phase was water/acetonitrile (70:30), 5 mM potassium phosphate (pH = 3), and 340 mg/l sodium dodecyl sulfate, and the flow rate was 1 ml/min.
Liquid chromatography (LC)-MS was carried out with a ZMD Micromass spectrometer, equipped with a XTerra MS, Symmetry Shield C8 column (4.6 × 150 mm), a Waters 996 photodiode array detector, and a Waters 2690 separations module. Samples of 20 μl were analyzed, and compounds were isocratically eluted at a flow rate of 1 ml/min with a solution of water/acetonitrile (80:20) and 10 mM formic acid.
Concentrations of free fluoride in the culture supernatants were measured with a fluoride electrode (model 96-09, Thermo Russell, Scotland). Fresh sodium fluoride standards were prepared for calibration curves.
Chemicals
 4-FP (>98%) was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Steinheim, Germany). All chemicals were of the highest purity grade available (Sigma-Aldrich; Acros Organics, Geel, Belgium). The compound 4-fluorocatechol was kindly provided by Dr. Erik de Vries. Purity of 4-FP, 4-fluorocatechol, and hydroquinone was checked by HPLC.

Because strain IF1 showed the highest degradation rates combined with stoichiometric release of fluoride, this organism was chosen for further studies.

 sp. strain IF1
 To study the degradation potential of strain IF1, a range of organic compounds were tested as growth substrates. Cells were inoculated into MM, and different organic substrates were added at a concentration of 1 mM. After 72-h incubation growth, substrate disappearance and halide release were measured.
Growth and substrate removal were found when catechol, hydroquinone, hydroxyquinol, benzoate, phenol, 4-fluorocinnamic acid, and 4-nitrophenol were used as substrates. The organism did not grow on 2-fluorophenol, 3-fluorophenol, 4-chlorophenol, 4-bromophenol, 4-iodophenol, fluoroacetate, trifluoroacetate, fluoroacetamide, trifluoroethanol, or on 2-bromoethanol. The fact that strain IF1 is capable of growth on catechol, hydroquinone, and hydroxyquinol but not on 4-fluorocatechol indicates that 4-fluorocatechol is not the most likely intermediate in the 4-FP pathway, although toxic effects could also play a role.

The above results suggest that 4-FP is initially converted to hydroquinone. The most likely enzyme involved in such a conversion is a 4-FP monooxygenase.

When hydroquinone was used as an assay substrate, its typical spectrophotometric peak at 288 nm was not replaced by a peak absorbing at 290 to 320 nm, which would have pointed to formation of hydroxymuconic semialdehyde. Thus, no hydroquinone dioxygenase was induced, or its product was rapidly further converted. The latter was ruled out by the observation that added hydroxymuconic semialdehyde was not converted by cell extracts of strain IF1, indicating that no hydroxymuconic semialdehyde dehydrogenase was induced during growth in the presence of 4-FP. These results make it unlikely that hydroxymuconic semialdehyde is an intermediate in the 4-FP pathway by strain IF1.
When cell extracts were assayed for hydroxyquinol degradation, complete conversion of the substrate was observed with HPLC. When the reaction was monitored spectrophotometrically, the peak at 287 nm, typical of hydroxyquinol, was substituted by a peak at 245 nm, typical of maleylacetate. This indicates the involvement of a hydroxyquinol oxygenase that converts hydroxyquinol into maleylacetate, which is further converted into 3-oxoadipate.

 strain IF1, which grows on 4-FP, possesses a new pathway for the degradation of 4-FP that involves immediate defluorination by a monooxygenase. Strain IF1 avoids the accumulation of possible toxic metabolites such as 3- or 4-fluorocatechol by this initial dehalogenation.
