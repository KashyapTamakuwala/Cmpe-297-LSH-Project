The present study demonstrates that intact cTnI can be released from viable cardiomyocytes by stimulation of stretch-responsive integrins.

We hypothesize that the stretch-related process through which cTnI can be released from viable cardiomyocytes is mediated by integrin stimulation. The purpose of the present study is therefore to investigate whether (1) RGD-induced integrin stimulation causes release of intact and/or fragmented cTnI from cardiomyocytes in the absence of necrotic cell death, (2) integrin stimulation is associated with MMP2 activation and MMP2-related cTnI degradation, and (3) cTnI release in the absence of necrosis differs from the release of cTnI in the presence of necrosis.

Western blot analysis
Protein extracts were size-fractionated on NuPage Novex 12% Bis–Tris gels (Invitrogen) and transferred to Hybond PVDF membranes (Amersham Biosciences, Roosendaal, The Netherlands). Non-specific binding sites were blocked using blocking solution consisting of 20 g/l ECL advance blocking agent (Amersham Biosciences) in TBS-Tween (10 mmol/l Tris–HCl, 150 mmol/l NaCl, 0.05% Tween pH 8.0). Membranes were incubated for 1 h with the anti-TnI antibody (K83085G, Biodesign, Saco, ME, USA), which detects various cTnI degradation products. After four washes in TBS-Tween, membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody (rabbit anti-goat IgG, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Heidelberg, Germany). Chemiluminescence was induced by ECL advance detection reagent (Amersham Biosciences) and detected by exposure to Hyperfilm ECL (Amersham Biosciences).

The total LDH activity in each culture, i.e., cell+medium, was determined, and the LDH activity in cell and medium samples was expressed as a percentage of total LDH activity. The detection limit of the LDH assay was 5 U/l, the intra-assay variability was 3% (110 U/l) and 6% (48 U/l), and inter-assay variability was 12% (110 U/l).

Subsequently, cultures were incubated with digitonine (10 μmol/l) for 5 min to induce necrotic cell death in all cardiomyocytes. The extent of necrosis equalled the number of necrotic nuclei before digitonine incubation as a fraction of the number of necrotic nuclei after digitonine incubation (100%).

After electrophoresis, the gels were washed twice in 2.5% Triton X-100, were washed in enzyme buffer, and were incubated in enzyme buffer at 37°C overnight. Gels were stained with amino black and subsequently destained. Gelatinase activity was quantified by measuring the extent of gelatin digestion using a scanning densitometer (2202 Ultrascan, LKB, Paramus, NJ, USA).

Discussion
GRGDS
 leads to (1) release of intact cTnI from viable cardiomyocytes in the absence of necrosis and (2) increased levels of intracellular and extracellular MMP2 activity that, however, does not result in degradation of cTnI into its fragments. This study therefore indicates that the release mechanism of cTnI from viable cardiomyocytes upon integrin stimulation differs from cTnI release from necrotic cardiomyocytes, which is associated with extensive cTnI degradation.

The mechanism responsible for this protective effect is unlikely to be related to integrin function but may be related to protection against necrosis exerted by certain proteins such as serum components.

-treated cardiomyocytes may be explained by a difference in specific MMP2 activity. The MMP2 activity per nanogram cTnI in the study with purified cTnI was fourfold higher than that in cardiomyocytes treated with RGD. In addition, purified cTnI may be more susceptible to MMP2 cleavage than cTnI that is complexed to cTnT, cTnC, and tropomyosin. In cardiomyocytes, 93–97% of cTnI is complexed to cTnT, cTnC, and tropomyosin which may protect the MMP2 cleavage sites on the cTnI molecule.

]. This mechanism is responsible for the release of proteins, such as myocyte-derived growth factors (fibroblast growth factors 1 and 2), which are released despite the lack of a classic signal peptide sequence normally associated with exocytotic secretion. These mechanically induced alterations in cardiomyocyte’s sarcolemmal permeability may similarly be involved in the release of cTnI from the cytosolic pool of cardiomyocytes in the absence of necrotic cell death. Further study is needed to address this issue.

Conclusions
The present study demonstrates that viable cardiomyocytes release cTnI as an intact protein by a stretch-related mechanism mediated by integrins. This finding may possibly explain why, in several pathological conditions, plasma cTnI levels are elevated in the absence of myocardial necrosis.
