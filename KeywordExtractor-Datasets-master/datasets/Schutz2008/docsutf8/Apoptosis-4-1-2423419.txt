]. CAD is thought to be responsible for the majority of nuclear activity resulting in chromosomal DNA fragmentation. When apoptosis is activated, ICAD is cleaved by executor caspases, mainly caspase-3, into three fragments, after which it dissociates from CAD, resulting in CAD activation.

I sites were used as follows: forward (5′-GAATTCAGGCTGGTCTCAAACTACTG-3′) and reverse (5′-GAATTCGATCTCGCCAGATTCTGGTA-3′). The PCR reaction was carried out at 94°C for 1 min, 55°C for 1.5 min, and 72°C for 2 min, for total of 35 cycles. Each PCR product was purified and subcloned into a pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega), followed by sequencing using an ABI PRISM 310 automated DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems).

]. Firefly luciferase activity was standardized according to Renilla luciferase activity.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation
Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were performed using the ChIP assay kit (Upstate). Briefly, cells in 100-mm dishes were grown to 70% confluency over 48 h. The chromatin from formaldehyde-fixed cells was sonicated and immunoprecipitated using mouse monoclonal anti-c-Myc or anti-N-Myc antibodies (Santa Cruz). The chromatin immunoprecipitate was analysed by PCR with the following primer pairs: F1 (5′-CGAGCTCGGTATACATGCGTGTGCATCG-3′) and R1 (5′-CAAGCTTGCCTCCACAAGGTGGGACCTG-3′) for amplifying the region from nt −272 to −71 containing potential Myc-binding sites; and F2 (5′-GAGATCAAAACTGCAGTGAG-3′) and R2 (5′-CACTGTTGGAGATTGTTCAG-3′) for amplifying the region from nt −789 to −451 that does not contain Myc-binding sites.

Western blotting
Cells were washed with PBS and lysed in SDS sample buffer. Cell lysate samples were separated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrotransferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilion; Millipore). After blocking in nonfat milk solution (Blocking One; Nakaraitesk), the membranes were probed with monoclonal antibody against the ICAD protein (Santa Cruz), c-Myc (Sigma), or N-Myc (Santa Cruz), as the primary antibody for 1 h. After being washed, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse immunoglobulin as the secondary antibody, followed by visualization with SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce Biotechnology).

Huh-7 cells were transfected with 100 pmol/ml siRNA using FuGENE6 (Roche) in Opti-MEM I (Invitrogen), after which the medium was replaced by standard DMEM after 6 h of transfection.

RNA preparation and real-time quantitative RT-PCR
Total RNA was extracted using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. First-strand cDNAs were synthesized using the SuperScriptIII First-Strand Synthesis kit (Invitrogen) and then used as templates for real-time PCR. Quantitative PCR was performed using the ABI Prism 7700 sequence detection system using Taq-Man Gene Expression assays (Applied Biosystems). The standard curve was created using serially diluted total RNA obtained from Huh-7 cultures and β-actin was chosen as the internal standard to control for variability in amplification. Amplification was performed at 95°C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of amplification at 95°C for 15 s and 60°C for 60 s.

Furthermore, we demonstrated the functional importance of Myc proteins with regard to transcriptional regulation of the ICAD gene from studies examining ectopic expression of c-Myc and N-Myc, as well as with RNAi technology. We showed that expression levels of ICAD and Myc correlate in some tumors.

]. Involvement of Myc in up-regulation of ICAD expression as demonstrated in this study might present a novel mechanism of Myc-dependent inhibition of apoptosis. It is possible that elevated levels of ICAD in cells inhibit activation of endonuclear activity, thereby increasing the threshold for apoptosis signaling.
