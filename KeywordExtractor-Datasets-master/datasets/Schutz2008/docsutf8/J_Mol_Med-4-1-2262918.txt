Heat shock proteins (hsps) are protective against the harmful effects of mutant expanded polyglutamine repeat proteins that occur in diseases such as Huntington’s, prompting the search for pharmacologic compounds that increase hsp expression in cells as potential treatments for this and related diseases. In this paper, we show that celastrol, a compound recently shown to up-regulate hsp gene expression, significantly decreases killing of cells expressing mutant polyglutamine protein. This effect requires the presence of the transcription factor responsible for mediating inducible hsp gene expression, HSF1, and is correlated with decreased amounts and increased sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) solubility of polyglutamine aggregates. These results suggest the potential of celastrol as a therapeutic agent in the treatment of human polyglutamine expansion diseases.

], but these studies did not examine the mechanism by which celastrol protects cells from expanded polyglutamine protein cytotoxicity.
The results of the experiments presented in this paper demonstrate that celastrol is effective in preventing both the aggregation and toxicity of polyglutamine expression in cells and that it mediates these effects via the HSF1-mediated gene expression pathway. These results support the potential of this drug as a possible therapeutic agent for treating polyglutamine expansion diseases. The results also suggest that other drugs that stimulate HSF1 activity leading to hsp gene expression may also have beneficial activity against these disease states as well as other human diseases that are caused by protein misfolding.

-YFP) vectors were constructed using CAG repeats that were synthesized by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from human dentatorubral pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) cDNAs containing different CAG repeats. HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM; Cellgro) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 50 μg/ml gentamicin. PC12 cells were cultured in DMEM medium (Cellgro) supplemented with 5% FBS and 10% heat-inactivated horse serum (Gibco), and 100 units/ml Penicillin-Streptomycin (Gibco). HSF1+/+ and HSF1−/− mouse embryo fibroblast (MEF) cells (kindly provided by Dr. Ivor Benjamin, University of Utah) were cultured in DMEM medium (Cellgro) supplemented with 10% FBS, 1× Penicillin-streptomycin (Gibco), and 1× Non-essential amino acids (Gibco). Transfection was performed using Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen), following the manufacturer’s protocol. Celastrol (Calbiochem) was dissolved in dimethyl sulphoxide at a stock concentration of 5.54 mM.

The number of stained cells as well as the total number of cells was counted, and the percentage of stained cells was taken to represent the percentage of cell death.

Our data do indicate, however, the protective effects of celastrol with respect to polyglutamine toxicity.
