More than 30 years ago, Judah Folkman found a revolutionary new way to think about cancer. He postulated that in order to survive and grow, tumors require blood vessels, and that by cutting off that blood supply, a cancer could be starved into remission. What began as a revolutionary approach to cancer has evolved into one of the most exciting areas of scientific inquiry today. Over the years, Folkman and a growing team of researchers have isolated the proteins and unraveled the processes that regulate angiogenesis. Meanwhile, a new generation of angiogenesis research has emerged as well, widening the field into new areas of human disease and deepening it to examine the underlying biological processes responsible for those diseases.

Early evidence of tumor cells releasing specific growth factor for blood vessels

] were the first to appreciate that growing malignancies could continuously elicit new capillary growth from the host. They used a transparent chamber implanted in a cat’s skin to study the vasoproliferative reaction secondary to a wound or implantation of normal or neoplastic tissues. They showed that the vasoproliferative response induced by tumor tissues was more substantial and earlier than that induced by normal tissues or following a wound. They concluded that the growth of a tumor is closely connected to the development of an intrinsic vascular network.
3
] found that the vasoproliferative response of normal or neoplastic tissues transplanted into muscle was not significantly different with respect to the time of onset of new blood vessels, though it was stronger when the implantation was performed in a resection area. In addition, while normal tissues induced a vasoproliferative response confined to the host, tumor tissues induced the formation of neovessels that pierced the implant. Lastly, the intensity of the response seemed to be influenced by the distance between the implant and the host’s vessels: normal tissue was unable to induce a response if placed more than 50 μm away, whereas tumor tissue had a longer activity range.

]. The size of the tumors was measured daily, and the onset of vascularization of each tumor was determined in vivo with a stereomicroscope and confirmed with histological sections. Proliferation of chick capillaries occurred in the neighborhood of the tumor graft by 24 h after implantation, but capillary sprouts did not penetrate the tumor graft until approximately 72 h. During the avascular phase, tumor diameter did not exceed 1 mm. Small tumor implants of 0.5 mm or less grew to 1 mm and stopped expanding. Larger tumor implants of 2- or 3-mm shrank until they reached 1-mm diameter. During the first 24 h after penetration by capillaries, there was a rapid tumor growth. Neovascularization was not grossly observable with the stereomicroscope until after day 10 or 11. Tumors implanted on the CAM after day 11 grow at slower rate in parallel with the reduced rates of endothelial growth.

17
], the behavior of tumor grafts on the CAM was compared to grafts of normal adult and embryonic tissues. In tumor tissue, preexisting blood vessels within the tumor graft disintegrated by 24 h after implantation. Neovascularization did not occur until after at least 3 days, and only by penetration of proliferating host vessels into the tumor tissue. There was marked neovascularization of host vessels in the neighborhood of the tumor graft. By contrast, in embryonic graft, preexisting vessels did not disintegrated. They reattached by anastomosis to the host vessels within 1–2 days, but with minimal or almost no neovascularization on the part of the host vessels. In adult tissues, the preexisting graft vessels disintegrated; there was no reattachment of their circulation with the host, and adult tissues did not stimulate capillary proliferation. These studies suggest that only tumor grafts are capable of stimulating formation of new blood vessels in the host.

Isolation of the first angiogenic tumor factor
Until the early 1970s, it was widely assumed that tumors did not produce specific angiogenic proteins. The conventional widsom was that tumor vasculature was an inflammatory reaction to dying or necrotic tumor cells.

First evidence of the existence of the avascular and vascular phases of solid tumor growth
The earliest evidence of the existence of the two phases was obtained by Folkman and collaborators in 1963, who perfused the lobe of a thyroid gland with plasma and inoculated a suspension of melanoma B16 tumor cells through the perfusion fluid. These cells grew into small, clearly visible black nodules. The nodules did not exceed 1 mm in diameter and did not connect with the host’s vascular network. Their outer third generally remained vital, while the interior portion underwent necrosis. Reimplanted nodules, on the other hand, equipped themselves with a vascular network and grew very rapidly. The conclusion was thus drawn that the absence of vascularization limits the growth of solid tumors.

]. It was apparent that by 48 h there was ultrastructural evidence of regenerating endothelium, including marked increase in ribosomes and endoplasmic reticulum, scarce or absent pinocytotic vesicles, and discontinuous basement membrane. Labeled endothelial cells were seen along newly formed sprouts as well as in parent vessels. Furthermore, pericytes were also shown to synthesize DNA.
10
]. After 1 week, new blood vessels had invaded the cornea starting from the edge closer to the site of implantation and developed in that direction at 0.2 mm and then about 1 mm/day. Once the vessels reached the tumor, it grew very rapidly to permeate the entire globe within 4 weeks.

Prognostic significance of tumor vascularity

] showed that measurement of microvascular density within isolated regions of high vessel concentration (i.e., hotspots) was a prognostic indicator for human breast and prostate carcinomas.
Microvascular density counting protocols have become the morphological gold standard to assess the neovasculature in human tumors. This method requires the use of specific markers to vascular endothelium and of immunohistochemical procedures to visualize microvessels. Microvascular density determined in primary tumors is significantly associated with metastasis and prognosis in several solid and hematological tumors.

Antiangiogenesis
The existence of specific angiogenesis inhibitors was first postulated by Folkman in 1971 in an editorial. No angiogenesis inhibitors existed before 1980, and few scientists thought at that time that such molecules would ever be found.

]. The inhibitory activities are associated with the carboxy-terminal region of the molecule. The growth of human colon carcinoma in athymic mice, as well as the growth of murine melanoma, was markedly inhibited by intralesional injections, whereas tumor cells were completely insensitive to rHuPF4 in vitro at levels that inhibited normal endothelial cell proliferation. Systemic administration of rHuPF4 has so far been ineffective against tumor growth, perhaps because of rapid inactivation or clearance of the peptide.

Angiostatic steroids
40
43
]. Furthermore, when this combination of heparin and steroid was suspended in a methylcellulose disk and implanted on the young (6-day) CAM, growing capillaries regressed leaving in their place, 48 h later, an avascular zone. The antiangiogenic effect was specific for growing capillaries. Mature nongrowing capillaries in older membranes were unaffected. Nonanticoagulant heparin had the same effect. A hexasaccharide fragment with a molecular weight of approximately 16,000 was found to be the most potent inhibitor of angiogenesis (in the presence of a corticosteroid). The combination of the heparin hexasaccharide fragment and cortisone also inhibited tumor-induced angiogenesis in the rabbit cornea.
44
]. These events occur as 24–48 h and are accompanied by dissolution of the basement membrane of the new capillary vessels.

Fumagillin
Aspergillus fumigatus fresenius
45
]. A conditioned medium from fungal cultures contained an inhibitor of endothelial cell proliferation and angiogenesis, which, upon purification, was found to be fumagillin, a polyene macrolide. When capillary endothelial cells were stimulated by fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2), half-maximal inhibition was observed with fumagillin at 100 pg/ml. This antiproliferative effect appeared to be relatively specific for endothelial cells because inhibition of nonendothelial cells, including tumor cells, was observed at up to 1,000-fold higher concentrations.
Scientists at Takeda Chemical Industries (Osaka, Japan) made a synthetic analogue of fumagillin, called TNP-470, which inhibits endothelial proliferation in vitro at a concentration 3 logs lower than the concentration necessary to inhibit fibroblasts, and tumor cells.

Angiostatin and endostatin
46
]. Bouck reported that the switch to angiogenesis during tumorigenesis of transformed hamster cells was associated with downregulation of an inhibitor of angiogenesis, thrombospondin. She suggested that the switch to the angiogenic phenotype could be the result of a shift in the net balance of positive and negative regulators of angiogenesis.

49
], is a 20-kD protein with an N-terminal amino acid sequence identical to the carboxyterminus of collagen XVIII. It was purified directly from tumor cell-conditioned medium. Endostatin is also a specific inhibitor of endothelial proliferation and has no effects on resting endothelial cells or on other cell types. It is slightly more potent than angiostatin and also causes regression of large tumors to a microscopic size.

Thalidomide
50
]. Corneal neovascularization in rabbits induced by FGF-2 or VEGF was blocked by orally administered thalidomide. This activity of thalidomide was mainly the result of its direct effect on inhibiting new blood vessel formation and not on suppression of infiltrating host inflammatory cells. Histologic sections of the pretreated neovascularized corneas were virtually free of inflammatory cells. Thalidomide also inhibited corneal neovascularization in mice, but it was necessary to give the drug by the intraperitoneal route and at high doses, because mice do not metabolize thalidomide effectively.

2-Methoxyestradiol
35
]. Moreover, since 2-methoxyestradiol causes mitotic perturbations, they examined its interactions with tubulin and showed that 2-methoxyestradiol bound to colchicine site of tubulin and, depending on reaction conditions, either inhibited assembly or seems to be incorporated into a polymer with altered stability properties.

Cleaved antithrombin III
51
] in which the externally configured stressed loop of antithrombin was retracted into the body of the molecule. The 53-kD form is a specific endothelial inhibitor and a potent angiogenesis inhibitor and has no thrombin binding activity.

Caplostatin
N
52
53
53
]. Caplostatin prevents vascular leakage induced by VEGF, bradykinin, histamine, and platelet-activating factor and prevents pulmonary edema induced by interleukin-2.

Antiangiogenic chemotherapy
54
]. Conventional chemotherapy is administered at maximum tolerated doses followed by off-therapy intervals of 2–3 weeks to allow the bone marrow and gastrointestinal tract to recover. In contrast, antiangiogenic chemotherapy is administered more frequently at lower doses, without long interruptions in therapy and with little or no toxicity. During antiangiogenic chemotherapy, endothelial cell apoptosis and capillary dropout precede the death of tumor cells that surround each capillary.

Concluding remarks
Currently, several compounds with angiostatic activity are approved for clinical use, and many are in late-stage clinical development. However, the results from clinical trials have not shown the antitumor effects which were expected following preclinical studies. It appears that clinical applications of antiangiogenic therapy are more complex than originally thought.
The main problem in the development of antiangiogenic agents is that multiple angiogenic molecules may be produced by tumors, and tumors at different stages of development may depend on different angiogenic factors for their blood supply. Therefore, blocking a single angiogenic molecule was expected to have little or no impact on tumor growth. Current development of targeted antiangiogenic agents include their use in adjuvant settings and the combination of different antiangiogenic inhibitors to take a more comprehensive approach in blocking tumor angiogenesis.
Advancing insights into fundamental mechanisms will be necessary in the development of novel anticancer strategies based on inhibition of angiogenesis.
