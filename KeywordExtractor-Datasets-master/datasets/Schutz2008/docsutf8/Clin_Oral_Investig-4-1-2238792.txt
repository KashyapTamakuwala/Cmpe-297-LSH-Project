Within the context of preventing non-communicable diseases, the World Health Report (2002) and the WHO Global Oral Health Program (2003) put forward a new strategy of disease prevention and health promotion. Greater emphasis is placed on developing global policies in oral health promotion and oral disease prevention. The Decayed, Missing, Filled Teeth (DMFT) index does not meet new challenges in the field of oral health. Dental erosion seems to be a growing problem, and in some countries, an increase in erosion of teeth is associated with an increase in the consumption of beverages containing acids. Therefore, within a revision of the WHO Oral Health Surveys Basic Methods, new oral disease patterns, e.g. dental erosion, have to be taken into account. Within the last 20 years, many studies on dental erosion have been carried out and published. There has been a rapid growth in the number of indexes quantifying dental erosion process in different age groups. However, these indexes are not comparable. This article discusses quality criteria which an index intended for assessing tooth erosion should possess.

Introduction
52
]. The main orientation of the WHO Oral Health Program (2003) is that oral health is integral, essential and interrelated to general health and a determinant factor for quality of life. Proper oral health care reduce the burden of disease as well as premature mortality. Risk factors for oral diseases are common with cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases.

To identify indicators of oral health, of critical oral health care, its quality of care and of essential health resources

To strengthen the ability at the local, national and regional levels to measure, compare and determine the effects of oral health services and use of resources

To identify indicators of oral health (problems, determinants and risk factors related to lifestyle) of critical oral health care

To identify the types of data generation and management problems within the Health Information System

To identify principles for guiding the selection and use of oral health indicators

To identify a set of core indicators for oral health

To review the recent oral health-indicator selection efforts

]. The statements of the European Global Oral Health Indicators Report coincide with the experience in the field of development and using of different erosion indexes. Therefore, it would be necessary to strengthen the international alliance of dentists, epidemiologists, statisticians and other scientists and politicians, to develop an adequate oral health indicators set, i.e. as a subset or user-window of the ECHI-Database (European Community Health Indicators-Database) and within the Oral Databank of the WHO and to develop an internationally agreed and accepted erosion index.

–Which erosion indexes are mostly used in the scientific literature?

–Which quality criteria should indexes possess?

–What differences exist between individual- and population-based erosion indexes?



Finally in the discussion, we will debate whether it is possible to involve erosion indexes into Health Indicator Sets and into International Classification of Diseases (ICD; e.g. ECHI, HFA21, country databases on oral Health, ICD-11).

Individual versus population-based erosion indexes
An individual-based index should fulfill other criteria than a population-based index. The first should allow assessment of the full truth of the construct “tooth erosion”. Therefore, a very good individual-based erosion index should nearly be a gold-standard instrument. Using a population-based erosion index, the individual assessment should take less time to allow an assessment in big population samples. Therefore, for practical reasons, a population-based erosion index is often a short form of an individual-based index. However, a good population-based erosion index should possess very high validity as well as high reliability.

Discussion
48
] has been widely used in most Medline-cited cross-sectional studies. For children, there is no index that is most used. However, the literature analysis is limited. Only one search strategy was used. Some articles which do not use the mentioned key words or mesh headings might not be included in the analysis. However, the results presented help to get a first view on the different indexes on tooth erosion cited in the last 6 years.

Quality criteria of indexes for measuring tooth erosion
”. At the beginning of the study, it has to be considered how many patients and how many examiners respectively have to be involved. This is because the number of patients and examiners should be as small as possible for practical and economic reasons. On the other hand, the number of patients and examiners has to be sufficiently high because otherwise a certain degree of reliability, which actually exists, might be overlooked. Therefore, solid sample-size calculations should be conducted with the help of an experienced statistician.
So far, there is no consensus concerning a gold-standard instrument. However, a gold standard is important for comparison. Otherwise, criterion validity cannot be checked. If one attempts to develop a gold-standard instrument, the first step would be a thorough discussion of which aspects of the construct “tooth erosion” have to be included. This should be conducted by established experts to ensure content validity. When the instrument is constructed, inter-examiner reliability and intra-examiner reliability can be examined as described above. However, this should be done not only in a national but in an international context.
calibration study
, known data on the observed relationship between an independent variable of the population-based short version of the assessment instrument and the dependent variable of the gold-standard instrument are used to make estimates of other “true” values of the independent variable from new observations of the gold standard.
One of the prospective targets ought to be the inclusion of indexes on dental health prevention especially of an internationally agreed “erosion index” into the existing Health Indicator Sets. These would be the Health for All Database of the WHO (HFA21), The European Community Health Indicator Set (ECHI), Country Databases on Oral Health and the inclusion of Dental Erosion into the International Classification of Diseases and Health-Related Problems.

Conclusion
Further efforts have to be made in the development of an internationally agreed index which is able to assess dental erosion with as much reliability and validity as possible. Current recommendations of the WHO and the European Union and health task forces within countries and Dental Associations should be used to develop and to discuss the concept of tooth erosion and the development of a unified erosion index.
