Background
The majority of sentinel node (SN) positive breast cancer patients do not have additional non-SN involvement and may not benefit from axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). Previous studies in melanoma have suggested that microanatomic localization of SN metastases may predict non-SN involvement. The present study was designed to assess whether these criteria might also be used to be more restrictive in selecting breast cancer patients who would benefit from an ALND.

Methods
A consecutive series of 357 patients with invasive breast cancer and a tumor-positive axillary SN, followed by an ALND, was reviewed. Microanatomic SN tumor features (subcapsular, combined subcapsular and parenchymal, parenchymal, extensive localization, multifocality, and the penetrative depth from the SN capsule) were evaluated for their predictive value for non-SN involvement.

Results
Non-SN metastases were found in 136/357 cases (38%). Microanatomic location and penetrative depth of SN metastases were significant predictors for non-SN involvement (<0.001); limited penetrative depth was associated with a low frequency of non-SN involvement with a minimal of 10%.

Conclusions
Microanatomic location and penetrative depth of breast cancer SN metastases predict non-SN involvement. However, based on these features no subgroup of patients could be selected with less than 10% non-SN involvement.

 Predicting the chance of involvement of the non-SN would facilitate the selection of patients with a potential therapeutic benefit of ALND.

 However, none of these factors are sensitive and reproducible enough to reliably identify a subgroup of patients who might be spared ALND.

We therefore set out to study the predictive value of microanatomic location and penetrative depth of SN metastatic deposits for non-SN metastases, accurately assessed by morphometry, in a large series of SN-positive breast cancer patients.

On the same day, immediately preoperatively 0.5 mL Patent blue dye (Guerbet, Aulnay-sous-Bois, France) was injected intradermally and intra/peritumorally. The SN was identified after careful dissection of blue lymphatic channels and detection of radioactivity with a handheld gamma ray detection probe. Palpation of the open axilla was performed to detect enlarged non-SN metastases.

 also recorded that the microanatomic location of melanoma SN metastases predicts non-SN involvement, and proposed that it would be possible to safely avoid a lymph node dissection in patients with subcapsular deposits only. Indeed, subcapsular location and small tumor penetrative depth correlated with less non-SN involvement in our breast cancer study, although no subgroup of patients could be selected without non-SN involvement.
The measurement of the SN tumor penetrative depth was difficult in many cases, especially in case of extensive tumor deposits. In these cases the tumor deposits frequently extended beyond the center of the lymph node, making it difficult to determine which edge of the SN capsule should be used to measure the tumor penetrative depth. Similar difficulties were encountered when the SN had a lobulated outline. Further studies which more rigorously define the tumor penetrative depth may strengthen its predictive power and reproducibility.
In conclusion, patients with breast carcinoma and SN involvement can be stratified into subgroups at significantly different risk for non-SN involvement, according to microanatomic localization of the SN metastatic deposits and penetrative depth into the SN. However, based on these features no subgroup of patients could be selected without non-SN involvement.
