Purpose
The clinical diagnosis and management of invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) of the breast presents difficulties. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been proposed as the imaging modality of choice for the evaluation of ILC. Small studies addressing different aspects of MRI in ILC have been presented but no large series to date. To address the usefulness of MRI in the work-up of ILC, we performed a review of the currently published literature.

Materials and methods
We performed a literature search using the query “lobular AND (MRI OR MR OR MRT OR magnetic)” in the Cochrane library, PubMed and scholar.google.com, to retrieve all articles that dealt with the use of MRI in patients with ILC. We addressed sensitivity, morphologic appearance, correlation with pathology, detection of additional lesions, and impact of MRI on surgery as different endpoints. Whenever possible we performed meta-analysis of the pooled data.

Results
Sensitivity is 93.3% and equal to overall sensitivity of MRI for malignancy in the breast. Morphologic appearance is highly heterogeneous and probably heavily influenced by interreader variability. Correlation with pathology ranges from 0.81 to 0.97; overestimation of lesion size occurs but is rare. In 32% of patients, additional ipsilateral lesions are detected and in 7% contralateral lesions are only detected by MRI. Consequently, MRI induces change in surgical management in 28.3% of cases.

Conclusion
This analysis indicates MRI to be valuable in the work-up of ILC. It provides additional knowledge that cannot be obtained by conventional imaging modalities which can be helpful in patient treatment.

The morphologic aspects of ILC are not yet well defined, nor is the dynamic behavior of contrast agents in these tumors clearly documented.

Moreover, whether the MRI findings are similar to pathologic findings and can thus be used for accurate staging still needs to be established.

Finally, the impact of MRI on surgical treatment of ILC should be evaluated.


To answer these questions we performed a thorough review of the existing literature regarding the use of MRI in case of ILC and performed meta-analysis whenever possible. We subsequently reviewed the literature on other imaging modalities for this indication in order to evaluate the use of MRI from a clinical perspective.

Materials and methods
Search strategy
We performed a literature search for articles that specifically dealt with the use of MRI in patients with histologic proof of ILC published before 1 April 2006. The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE and the in-progress citations as provided by PubMed were searched using the query: “lobular AND (MR OR MRI OR MRT OR magnetic).” These databases were further searched using the “Related Articles” function in PubMed. The same query was used to browse the web using scholar.google.com.
Furthermore, the references of all retrieved articles were manually searched for relevant cross-references. Articles in all languages were accepted. All retrieved articles were then compared and from overlapping series of patients only the most recent publication was accepted.
Many different search terms were used for literature review of other imaging modalities. However, only PubMed was used as search engine.

Endpoints
What is the sensitivity of MRI for ILC?

What are the visual characteristics of ILC on MRI?

Are the findings on MRI equal to the findings at pathology?

What is the impact of MRI on surgical management of ILC?

], we defined architectural distortion, regional, segmental, ductal, multifocal, or diffuse enhancement, and multiple enhancing foci as descriptors of non-mass lesions. Nodular or focal enhancement, well-defined, round, irregular or spiculated masses, and dominant masses with small enhancing foci were defined as descriptors of mass-like lesions. Correlation between the findings on MRI and pathology was evaluated for relative tumor size (unifocal versus multifocal disease and single quadrant versus multicentric disease) and absolute tumor size. The impact on surgical management was derived from all changes implemented, based solely on MRI findings. The numbers of correct and incorrect changes were tabulated.

Eligibility criteria
Detection
: Studies had to be based on a pathology database and all subsequent patients with ILC who underwent a MRI had to be included. The total number of ILC confirmed at pathology had to be clearly stated as well as the number of lesions found with MRI.
Morphology
: Studies describing the appearance of ILC visible on MRI were eligible. Separation between mass and non-mass-like lesions had to be possible.
Dynamic curve analysis of contrast behavior
: Studies that described the enhancement versus time curve were eligible. However, as time to peak and shape of the final phase of the enhancement curve were our main endpoints, these had to be described.
Quantitative analysis of contrast behavior
: Studies performing quantitative analysis of the contrast-enhancement parameters were eligible.
Relative correlation with pathology
: Studies presenting data on the unifocal versus multifocal correlation or single quadrant involvement versus multicentric involvement were eligible.
Absolute correlation with pathology
: Studies comparing sizes measured on MRI with those measured at pathology and presenting a correlation coefficient or sufficient raw data to calculate such a value were eligible.
Detection of additional lesions
: Any study describing additional lesions apart from the index lesion detected by MRI only with subsequent acquisition of histologic proof of malignancy was considered eligible. Lesions in the ipsilateral breast and the contralateral breast were evaluated separately.
Impact on surgical treatment
: Studies mentioning all changes in surgical strategy based on MRI findings were eligible.

Both studies did not, however, include sufficient patients to produce meaningful results, other than a high variability in the values of these parameters and the presence in some tumors of enhancement very much like enhancement in normal breast tissue. It was noted that K21 values appeared to be an order of magnitude less in ILC than in IDC lesions.

Thus, the sensitivity of MRI found for ILC in the studies presented herein and the overall sensitivity of 93.3% calculated from these studies are not different from those known for malignancy in the breast in general. The relatively low heterogeneity of all studies describing lesion detection as well as detection of additional lesions in the ipsi- and contralateral breast show that the applied MRI technique only has a minor impact on the ability of MRI to detect lesions.
34
]. This study reported a sensitivity for ILC of only 83%, a discrepancy that may well be explained by the fact that the slice thickness in this study was 4.2 mm, thicker than in any of the other presented studies, which could have had a negative impact on sensitivity. Moreover, 15 of 23 patients in their series were scanned with a FLASH 3D sequence with TR 8.4/TE 3.0, resulting in image acquisition with a phase-shift of water and fat, which might have further decreased their sensitivity, although this was not apparent from their data.

Additional lesions and effect on surgical treatment
Especially important in this analysis is the detection of additional lesions apart from the index lesion in patients with ILC. The co-existence of other invasive malignant lesions apart from the index lesion in the ipsilateral breast in 32% of patients only visualized by MRI is high. Moreover, the detection of contralateral cancer in another 7% of patients by MRI only, seems to make MRI indispensable. These findings are confirmed by the rate of change in treatment of the ipsilateral breast based on MRI. The fact that change in treatment was considered correct, as verified by pathologic findings in the specimen, in 88% of cases shows that ILC is often more extensive than appreciated on conventional imaging.

]. However, in view of the MRI findings (additional malignant lesions in 32% of patients), we can only conclude that in a large number of patients with ILC, surgery is not curative but merely debulking. As recurrence rates are fortunately much lower, we must assume that curative treatment is to be expected from adjuvant therapy. Unfortunately, because there is no possibility to determine which additional findings will respond to adjuvant therapy, the detection of additional lesions on MRI currently still requires a change of treatment when malignancy has been proven by core biopsy. This may further reduce the rate of recurrence in patients with ILC and may even improve survival. However, this requires confirmation in future studies.


Conclusion
Magnetic resonance imaging has a high sensitivity for ILC, not achieved by other imaging modalities. Therefore MRI is helpful in cases where conventional imaging is inconclusive. Morphology is often mass-like and a typical ILC presents as an irregular or spiculated mass. However, asymmetric enhancement that can be ductal, segmental, regional, or diffuse in nature may be the only sign of tumor. MRI measures disease extent with a high reliability. Although underestimation and overestimation of lesion size by MRI still occurs, it is more accurate than size determination by other modalities, indicating often more extensive tumor burden than expected.
The underestimation by other imaging modalities results in more failure of BCT, more re-excisions and more conversion to mastectomy in series where MRI is not used. MRI has an effect on surgical management in that when used to assess disease extent, surgical management was changed in 28.3% of which 88% were judged necessary based on pathology. Larger series of patients are required to confirm the findings of this review; especially evaluation of tumor morphology and dynamic profile seems feasible.
