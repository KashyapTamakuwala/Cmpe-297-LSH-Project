It is well established that several inflammatory-type conditions, such as arthritis, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and irritable bowel disease exist comorbidly and at an increased incidence in patients with psoriasis. Psoriasis and other associated diseases are thought to share common inflammatory pathways. Conditions such as these, with similar pathogenic mechanisms involving cytokine dysregulation, are referred to as immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs). Considerable evidence for the genetic basis of cormobidities in psoriasis exists. The WHO has reported that the occurrence of chronic diseases, including IMIDs, are a rising global burden. In addition, conditions linked with psoriasis have been associated with increasing rates of considerable morbidity and mortality. The presence of comorbid conditions in psoriasis patients has important implications for clinical management. QoL, direct health care expenditures and pharmacokinetics of concomitant therapies are impacted by the presence of comorbid conditions. For example, methotrexate is contraindicated in hepatic impairment, while patients on ciclosporin should be monitored for kidney function. In addition, some agents, such as beta blockers, lithium, synthetic antimalarial drugs, NSAIDs and tetracycline antibiotics, have been implicated in the initiation or exacerbation of psoriasis. Consequently, collaboration between physicians in different specialties is essential to ensuring that psoriasis treatment benefits the patient without exacerbating associated conditions.

Psoriasis: from gene to clinic
A satellite symposium held at the Royal College of Physicians, London, United Kingdom, in December 2005 investigated the associations between psoriasis, comorbid diseases and concomitant therapy and their significance for long-term patient treatment. The programme generated substantial debate and raised some clinically significant issues, which are further outlined here.

These identified diseases associated with psoriasis have led clinicians to look at underlying mechanisms that might be involved and start considering how managing comorbid conditions may impact treatment selection and outcome for the psoriasis patient.

The increased cardiovascular risk in psoriasis may result from

• The increased prevalence of associated risk factors, such as smoking, obesity, hypertension and alcohol misuse.

• The use of dyslipidaemic therapies, such as corticosteroids, acitretin and ciclosporin.

• An associated unfavourable lipid profile (high triglycerides, low HDL).

• Endothelial dysfunction.

• Uncontrolled inflammation. 

• Combination of some or all of the above.





Unfortunately, there is a shortage of published studies corrected for traditional risk factors and no published study has formally assessed systemic vasculature inflammation in psoriasis.

Effect of psoriasis treatment on comorbidities
The importance of considering the impact of treatment of diseases associated with psoriasis cannot be stressed enough. Working with physicians in different specialties (e.g., rheumatology, gastroenterology and cardiology) would allow physicians an opportunity to ensure that the psoriatic treatments do not worsen the associated condition and where possible provide additional benefits.

Drug interactions and precipitating disease in psoriasis
A diagnosis of psoriasis also has implications regarding treatment for physicians from specialities other than dermatology. The potential of some drugs (eg, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, beta blockers, NSAIDs) to ‘trigger’ psoriasis means that these drugs should be avoided where possible and awareness of this potential should be raised. The potential for drug interactions with some psoriasis drugs is high and this should also be considered when designing therapeutic regimens. Furthermore, the increased risk of cardiovascular events associated with psoriasis should be considered when conducting global cardiovascular risk assessments. If possible, lower cut-off points for treatment should be used in psoriasis patients in an effort to take into consideration their overall cardiovascular risk.



Discussion and conclusions
Psoriasis is a multifaceted systemic condition that is not restricted to cutaneous symptoms. There is a need for further research to fully understand the reasons for comorbidities and their implications on treatment and management of psoriasis patients. Data are required to fully characterise risk of cardiovascular disease in psoriasis patients and whether treatment can impact this level of risk. Could effective (systemic) treatment of psoriasis reduce the risk of comorbidities or, conversely, could effective treatment of comorbidities improve psoriasis? Investigation of the genetics of psoriasis and related inflammatory conditions may provide insight into their pathogenesis and points of commonality, which could reveal novel drug targets
However, while research is conducted, there is a pressing need for education about comorbidities in psoriasis. Dermatologists need to be aware of the likelihood of comorbid conditions to ensure their detection and that psoriasis is managed with consideration of the possible impact on associated comorbid inflammatory conditions. Similarly, physicians from other specialities should be aware of the potential impact of their management strategies on psoriasis and take care not to exacerbate psoriasis when treating associated conditions. A focus on rapid and profound systemic control of inflammation in psoriasis may have added benefits by controlling inflammation associated with comorbid conditions. It is clear that TNFα is a central mediator in psoriasis and many of the recognised associated diseases. Knowledge and awareness of the common inflammatory processes involved should provide the opportunity to more effectively treat the common causes of inflammatory conditions benefitting both physicians and patients. Managing the psoriasis patient as a whole with integrated therapy is likely to maximise outcomes.
