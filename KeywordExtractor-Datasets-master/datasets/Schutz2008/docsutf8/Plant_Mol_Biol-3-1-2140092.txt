Thus, we hypothesized that cells in dormant axillary buds are regulated through suppression mechanisms of cell cycle control suppression mechanisms similar to those in mammals.

]) whose products are required for either G1/S transition or DNA replication. Thus, by negatively regulating E2F family proteins, pRB negatively controls cell cycle progression. pRB is highly phosphorylated by several types of cyclin and cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) complexes in response to environmental signals or developmental programs to progress the cell cycle. E2F family proteins are released from hyper-ppRB and promote the transcription of genes for G1/S transition or DNA replication. Thus, pRB regulates the arrest and progression of the cell cycle based on its phosphorylation state.

Protein concentrations were determined with the DC Protein Assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Proteins were separated using sodium dodecyl sulfate—polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE, 10% acrylamide gels [acrylamide:bis-acrylamide = 37.5:1]), or 10% low bis-acrylamide gels [acrylamide:bis-acrylamide = 142:1]), and blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane (BA-S 85, Schleicher & Schuell, Dassel, Germany). The membrane was blocked with 5% skim milk and 0.05% Tween 20 in Tris-buffered saline (50 mM Tris–HCl [pH 8.0], and 150 mM NaCl), and incubated with the anti-PsRBR1 antibody at a dilution of 1:1000. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Pierce, Rockford, IL) was used as the secondary antibody at a dilution of 1:2000.

Discussion
In intact plants, the pea shoot apex inhibits growth; i.e., cell elongation and cell division of the dormant axillary buds. The cell cycle of dormant axillary buds is arrested at the G1 phase. Therefore, from the point of view of cell cycle control, the transition from dormancy to outgrowth in axillary buds seems to be from the G1 phase to the S phase. In animal cells, RB family proteins function as negative controllers in G1 arrest, and the activities of RB family proteins are controlled by their phosphorylation states. Here, we investigated phosphorylation states of the pea RB-related protein, PsRBR1, during the dormancy-to-growth transition in axillary buds. The results of the present study provide a basis for further studies of the molecular mechanisms underlying apical dominance and cell cycle control.

). Thus, plant RB-related proteins can function not only as plant factors, but also as animal factors. These results strongly suggest that the functions of plant RB-related proteins, including PsRBR1 protein, are similar to those of the mammalian RB family proteins in G1/S transition, and that plant and animal cells might use similar regulatory proteins and pathways for cell cycle control during the G1 phase. Therefore, the maintenance of this high degree of similarity throughout evolution (in plants, insects, and vertebrates), further emphasizes the critical roles of RB-related proteins.

(C), however, it appears that there was no increase in the non-phosphorylated form (lane 3) compared to the other lanes. The reason for this might be that a 40-kDa polypeptide was also detected by immunoblotting with the anti-PsRBR1 antibody (data not shown). The 40-kDa polypeptide was probably derived from in vitro-dephosphorylated PsRBR1 protein by degradation during λ-PPase treatment. In vitro-dephosphorylated PsRBR1 protein might be more unstable than in vivo-dephosphorylated PsRBR1 protein, despite the presence of proteinase inhibitors, though the reason for this is not clear.

). In the present paper, using λ-PPase treatment and in vivo labeling followed by immunoprecipitation with the anti-PsRBR1 antibody, we showed that PsRBR1 protein exists in three phosphorylated forms in axillary buds. Although we could not determine the number of phosphorylation sites in the Lp- and Hp-forms, the Lp- and Hp-forms might correspond to the hypo- and hyper-phosphorylated forms of PsRBR1 protein, respectively.

. D-type cyclin forms a complex with CDKs and immediately phosphorylates RB-related protein. The Hp-form induces gene expression for the G1/S transition in axillary bud cells. It is likely that RB-related protein controls the cell cycle in axillary buds during the dormancy-to-growth transition. Further analyses will provide more insight into the regulation of dormancy-to-growth transition in axillary buds.
