To assess the detection rate of nutcracker syndrome in children with isolated hematuria, renal Doppler ultrasound examinations were routinely performed on 216 consecutive children (176 microscopic hematuria and 40 gross hematuria). Renal Doppler ultrasound was also performed on 32 healthy normal children. The peak velocity (PV) was measured at the hilar portion of the left renal vein (LRV) and at the LRV between the aorta and the superior mesenteric artery. The PV at the aortomesenteric portion (P=0.003) and the PV ratios of the LRV (P=0.003) were significantly higher in children with hematuria than in normal children, while the PV at the hilar portion was not different. If a PV ratio of the LRV of at least 4.1 (the cut-off level set at the mean ±2 SD of the value for the normal children) was defined as abnormal, 72 cases (33.3%) in children with hematuria and no cases in normal children were diagnosed as having nutcracker syndrome. The prevalence of nutcracker syndrome is relatively high in children with isolated hematuria, and the inclusion of renal Doppler ultrasound as a screening examination has a substantial effect on the detection of nutcracker syndrome.

Therefore, we carried out a prospective study of routine renal Doppler ultrasound in children presenting with isolated hematuria at our Nephrology Unit. The main aim was to assess the detection rate of nutcracker syndrome by renal Doppler ultrasound as a screening examination.

Methods
Patients
All consecutive 221 children with isolated hematuria (gross and microscopic) who visited our Nephrology Unit between 1 January 2002 and 31 December 2004 were routinely offered a renal Doppler ultrasound to detect cases of nutcracker syndrome in addition to a complete blood cell count, electrolytes, biochemistry, coagulation profile, serology for hepatitis B, antinuclear antibody, anti-streptococcal O titer, complement C3 and C4, urine culture, urinary calcium/creatinine, two-dimensional ultrasonography and excretory urography.
Hematuria was defined as the presence of at least five red blood cells (RBCs) in a centrifuged specimen. A urine sample from each parent and sibling was examined for hematuria, and a family history of urolithiasis was considered positive if a sibling, parent, grandparent, or parental sibling had a history of renal-stone disease. We excluded proteinuria by urinalysis in most patients, but also collected 24-h urine collections if proteinuria was suspected by urinalysis in some patients with gross hematuria. We collected 24-h calcium and creatinine if the urinary calcium/creatinine ratio was more than 0.2. Hypercalciuria was defined when 24-h calcium excretion was more than 4 mg/kg. Children with a documented urinary tract infection (n=2), Henoch-Schoenlein purpura (n=1), and systemic lupus erythematosus (n=2) were excluded, because the causes of hematuria were evident in these patients.
Therefore, 216 patients were included in this study: 176 showed microscopic hematuria on several examinations (170 through mass urinary screening and 6 through routine urinalysis during admission due to other diseases) and 40 gross hematuria. The hematuria was intermittent in 19 patients and permanent in 197. Blood pressure was normal in all patients. Also, 32 age- and sex-matched normal healthy children with no evidence of renal disease or other chronic diseases were selected for comparison. This study was approved by the institutional review board and the research ethics committee of Yonsei Severance Hospital.

Renal Doppler ultrasound
Renal Doppler ultrasound was performed at the first visit by one experienced radiologist, not knowing whether the subjects had hematuria or were control subjects. A HDI 5000 sonography system with 5- to 8- and 4- to 6-MHz convex transducers (Philips, Ultrasound, Bothell, Wash.) was used, and the Doppler spectrum could be successfully obtained in most cases, except in one with a retroaortic left renal vein.
After the patients had fasted for 6 to 8 h, renal Doppler ultrasound was performed with the patients in the supine position. Peak velocity (PV) was measured in the transverse plane at two points in the LRV, one at the lateral portion of the LRV near the hilum (PV1) and the other where the LRV courses between the aorta and the superior mesenteric artery (aortomesenteric portion, PV2).
Doppler spectra of the LRV at the hilum were obtained with the transducer placed on the middle of the upper abdomen. Doppler spectra of the LRV at the aortomesenteric angle were obtained with the transducer placed on the right or left subcostal area for keeping the Doppler angle of the LRV less than 60°. It was relatively easy to obtain the PV at the hilar portion of the LRV with the Doppler angle of less than 60°, but there were some patients in whom the measurements of the PV at or beyond the aortomesenteric portion of the LRV were somewhat difficult with the Doppler angle of 60°. The median Doppler angle was 60° (range 32–66°) at the hilar portion and 60° (range 56–70°) at the aortomesenteric portion of the LRV. Ratios of the PV of the LRV between the two portions (Aortomesenteric PV/Hilar PV, PV2/PV1) were calculated.

Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed with Student’s t-test and chi-square test, using SPSS for Windows (version 11.0). The mean ±2 SD of PV2/PV1 ratios was calculated for normal controls and was used as the cut-off value for diagnosing nutcracker syndrome. A P value of 0.05 or less was defined as significant.

], the cause of isolated hematuria was defined in only 27% of their patients when routine diagnostic tests for hematuria were performed. However, they found that idiopathic hypercalciuria was the most common cause of hematuria with a prevalence of 26% in children with isolated hematuria by the routine evaluation of urinary calcium excretion. Nevertheless, the cause of hematuria in the remaining 47% of the patients could not be explained.
In the present study, we could not identify the cause of hematuria in 149 (69%) of the 216 patients when renal Doppler ultrasound was not performed, but 40 percent was found to have nutcracker syndrome by renal Doppler ultrasound. Thus, nutcracker syndrome was the most common cause of isolated hematuria in children without urinary tract infection or proteinuria in our study, and we speculate that childhood nutcracker syndrome might have been underestimated in the past.

]. Compression of the LRV between the aorta and the SMA may cause an increase in flow velocity in the LRV at the aortomesenteric angle, and this flow can be measured noninvasively by using Doppler ultrasound. Although anatomical definition of nutcracker syndrome is the compression between the aorta and the SMA, the changes (narrowing at the aortomesenteric portion and dilatation at the hilar portion) in diameters of LRV are variable according to the stage of nutcracker syndrome. This would be the reason that Doppler ultrasound had been developed to detect nutcracker syndrome in both adults and children.

] reported the PV at the hilar portion in hematuric adults with nutcracker syndrome was significantly lower than that in normal adults, suggesting compression of the LRV at the aortomesenteric portion could change the flow pattern in the hilar portion of the LRV. Similarly, our study also demonstrated that the PV at the hilar portion in the nutcracker group is significantly lower than that of the non-nutcracker group, suggesting the entrapment of the LRV might also influence the PV at the hilar portion.

]. Therefore, renal biopsy should be delayed in children with asymptomatic microscopic hematuria if nutcracker syndrome is detected. However, if hematuria persists despite the improvement of Doppler findings, renal biopsy might be necessary to detect other causes of hematuria.

]. Despite these limitations, our data suggested that nutcracker syndrome might be one of the leading causes of isolated hematuria during childhood.
