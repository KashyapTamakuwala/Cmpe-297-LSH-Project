Background
After a systematic mass mammography breast cancer screening programme was implemented between 1991 and 1996 (attendance 80%), we evaluated its impact on survival according to socioeconomic status (SES).

Methods
n
 = 4939). Multivariate analyses were performed using Cox regression analysis.

Results
P
P
 = 0.01). Survival was similar for all socio-economic groups in 1983–1990, but after the introduction of the screening programme women with low SES had lower age- and stage-adjusted survival rates (HR 2.0, 95%CI: 1.3–3.0). Survival was better for patients diagnosed in 1997–2002 compared to 1983–1990 for all socioeconomic strata; it was substantially better for the high SES group (HR 0.36, 0.2–0.5) compared to the lowest SES (HR 0.77, 0.6–1.1).

Conclusion
Although survival improved for women from each of the socio-economic strata, related to the high participation rate of the screening programme, women from lower socio-economic strata clearly benefited less from the breast cancer screening programme. That is also related to the higher prevalence of comorbidity and possibly suboptimal treatment.

Introduction
Mammography screening aims at early detection of breast cancer so that adequate treatment will eventually lower breast cancer mortality. In a mass screening programme, it is therefore especially important to reach women who have the highest chance of being diagnosed with advanced stage or have the lowest survival rates.

12
] we were able to investigate survival according to SES for a sufficient period of time after introduction.
We studied whether survival according to SES was affected differentially by the implementation of the screening programme.

Methods
The Eindhoven Cancer Registry records data on all patients newly diagnosed with cancer in the south–eastern part of the Netherlands, an area with now 2.4 million inhabitants (about 15% of the Dutch population) and only general hospitals. Trained registry personnel actively collect data on diagnosis, staging, and treatment from the medical records after notification by pathologists and medical registration offices.

].
For our analyses we included all patients age 50–69 years diagnosed in 1983–2002 with invasive breast cancer in the eastern part of the registration area (about 1 million inhabitants). This population has been followed-up for vital status up to 1-1-2005. Information on the vital status of all patients was obtained initially from the municipal registries and since 1998 from the Central Bureau for Genealogy. These registers provide virtually complete coverage of all deceased Dutch citizens.
12
11
]. We also used both SES indicators for the whole study period (1983–2002) to make sure any effect of diagnostic period was not attributable to the indicator we used.
We calculated distribution of age and stage of disease according to period of diagnosis.
14
]. Patients with either positive lymph nodes or metastases were considered to have advanced disease.
T
-tests were performed of differences between two groups.
Crude survival analyses were performed. The log-rank test was used to evaluate significant differences between survival curves in univariate analyses. We used Cox regression models to compute multivariate rates. The proportional hazard assumption of the predictor was evaluated by applying Kaplan–Meier Curves. The predictor satisfied the assumption of proportionality as the graphs of the survival function versus the survival time resulted in graphs with parallel curves as did the graphs of the log(−log(survival)) versus log of survival time. The independent prognostic effect of SES was investigated, adjusting for age and stage of disease, and stratified according to period of diagnosis (1983–1990, 1991–1996, 1997–2002). We also calculated the age and stage-adjusted effect of period of diagnosis stratified according to SES.

Results
Median age was similar for all three periods of diagnosis (59, 60, and 59 years, respectively).

Discussion
We found that the proportion of breast cancer patients with a low SES has decreased since the introduction of a mass biennial mammography screening programme with high response rates. Although stage distribution improved for all socio-economic groups, the proportion with advanced disease decreased the most in the highest socio-economic group. In the 1980s survival was similar for all socio-economic groups, but since the introduction of screening the survival of women with a high SES has improved more than that for low socio-economic classes, also after adjustment for age and stage.

] which may explain differences in survival if comorbidity occurs more frequently in low SES groups.
Since the Eindhoven Cancer Registry has recorded comorbidity for all newly diagnosed patients since 1993, we checked whether the prevalence varied across socioeconomic strata. Indeed, the proportion of patients with comorbidity was higher among those with a lower SES (70% of patients in the lowest SES group had one or more concomitant conditions compared to 60% of the high SES group). In particular, the prevalence of diabetes and cardiovascular disease was highest in the low SES groups (diabetes in 10% with low SES and 4% with high SES, cardiovascular disease 7% and 4%, respectively).

In conclusion, despite a very high participation rate women from lower socio-economic strata clearly benefited less from the introduction of the breast cancer screening programme than those with a lower SES, probably due to a higher prevalence of comorbidity and suboptimal treatment (for both the cancer and the concomitant disease).
