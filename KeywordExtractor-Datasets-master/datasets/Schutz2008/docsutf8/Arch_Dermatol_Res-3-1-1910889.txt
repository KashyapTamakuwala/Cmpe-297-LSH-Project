Adverse events triggered by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are among the most common drug-related intolerance reactions in medicine; they are possibly related to inhibition of cyclooxygenase-1. Coxibs, preferentially inhibiting cyclooxygenase-2, may therefore represent safe alternatives in patients with NSAID intolerance. We reviewed the literature in a systematic and structured manner to identify and evaluate studies on the tolerance of coxibs in patients with NSAID intolerance. We searched MEDLINE (1966–2006), the COCHRANE LIBRARY (4th Issue 2006) and EMBASE (1966–2006) up to December 9, 2006, and analysed all publications included using a predefined evaluation sheet. Symptoms and severity of adverse events to coxibs were analysed based on all articles comprising such information. Subsequently, the probability for adverse events triggered by coxibs was determined on analyses of double-blind prospective trials only. Among 3,304 patients with NSAID intolerance, 119 adverse events occurred under coxib medication. All adverse events, except two, have been allergic/urticarial in nature; none was lethal, but two were graded as life-threatening (grade 4). The two non-allergic adverse events were described as a grade 1 upper respiratory tract haemorrhage, and a grade 1 gastrointestinal symptom, respectively. In 13 double-blind prospective studies comprising a total of 591 patients with NSAID intolerance, only 13 adverse reactions to coxib provocations were observed. The triggering coxibs were rofecoxib (2/286), celecoxib (6/208), etoricoxib (4/56), and valdecoxib (1/41). This review documents the good tolerability of coxibs in patients with NSAID intolerance, for whom access to this class of drugs for short-term treatment of pain and inflammation is advantageous.

]. We therefore reviewed the relevant literature in a systematic and structured approach for evidence of coxib tolerance in patients with NSAID intolerance.

Methods
Search strategy
We searched MEDLINE (1966–2006), the COCHRANE LIBRARY (4th Issue 2006) and EMBASE (1966–2006) up to December 9, 2006. The following search terms were used: rofecoxib OR celecoxib OR valdecoxib OR parecoxib OR etoricoxib, combined with hypersensitivity OR intolerance. Those coxibs used in veterinary medicine (deracoxib, tiracoxib and cimicoxib) were not included in the literature search. No language or publication restriction was predefined. All publications reporting individual patients with NSAID intolerance and subsequent exposure to a COX-2 Inhibitor were identified and the reference lists of these articles were hand-searched for further publications. If articles could not be retrieved in full text, a copy was requested from the corresponding author and/or journal editor.

Data extraction and synthesis
All articles were analysed using a predefined evaluation sheet. Uncertainties were resolved by consensus decisions among the investigators. Data synthesis was qualitative and descriptive. The Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0 (CTCAE) was used to categorize adverse events.


Results
We identified 230 publications on coxibs and/or NSAID intolerance. Hundred and forty-six references not focusing on individual patients with NSAID intolerance were excluded. Unclear medication schemes or outcome reports led to exclusion of two articles. Eighty-four publications were evaluated for severity and type of adverse reactions to coxibs. Thirteen publications on double-blind studies were used to determine the probability of adverse reactions to coxibs.

]. This implies that our current understanding of NSAID-triggered intolerance is still imperfect, and its pathogenesis cannot be reduced to cyclooxygenase-mediated effects alone, but needs to take into account clinically relevant additional NSAID-mediated effects such as secretion of leukotrienes from mast cells and other leukocytes.
25

]. On the other hand, substantial evidence described here points towards a good tolerability of coxibs in patients with NSAID intolerance. Given the wide use of NSAIDs in the short-term treatment of trivial signs and symptoms, the availability of coxibs for these indications would be advantageous for this relevant subpopulation of patients, since this type of application is unlikely to increase cardiac risk.
