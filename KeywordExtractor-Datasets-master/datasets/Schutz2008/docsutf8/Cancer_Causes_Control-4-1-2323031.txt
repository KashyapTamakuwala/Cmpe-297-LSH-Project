Objective
Since screening for cancer has been advocated, funded, and promoted in France, it is important to evaluate the attitudes of subjects in the general population and general practitioners (GPs) toward cancer screening strategies.

Methods
EDIFICE is a nationwide opinion poll that was carried out by telephone among a representative sample of 1,504 subjects living in France and aged between 40 and 75 years and among a representative sample of 600 GPs. The questionnaire administered to subjects queried about previous screening for cancer.

Results
Ninety-three percent of women stated that they had undergone at least one mammography. Although rated “A” recommendation—strongly recommended—by the US Preventive Services Task Force, screening for colorectal cancer received less attention than prostate cancer screening which is rated “I”—insufficient evidence—(reported screening rates of 25% and 36%, respectively). Six percent of subjects stated that they had undergone lung cancer screening. GPs’ attitudes toward cancer screening showed similar inconsistencies.

Conclusions
It thus appears that understanding of cancer screening practices in the French general population does not match scientific evidence. To a lesser extent, this also holds for GPs.

]. The objectives of the nationwide EDIFICE opinion poll carried out in France were to collect data at the national level (the level of funding) about (1) subjects’ individual access to cancer screening procedures (through organized programs or on subjects’ own initiative) and (2) about general practitioners’ (GPs) attitudes toward cancer screening. Four frequent cancer types were selected on the grounds of their different screening statuses: BC and CRC for evidence of efficacy of screening and existence of a national screening program and prostate and lung cancers for neither evidence of efficacy of screening nor official screening program.

Methods
General population opinion poll

], based on the following criteria: sex, age (five categories), profession (eight categories), community size (five categories), and regional distribution (nine categories).

General practitioner opinion poll
A nationwide opinion poll was carried out by telephone from 31 January to 18 February, 2005 among a representative sample of 600 GPs practicing in France. Sample representativeness was assessed based on the following criteria: age (four categories) and regional distribution (five categories).

Fig. 1
Adherence to cancer screening strategies according to the French nationwide EDIFICE opinion poll (1,504 subjects, 600 general practitioners). In France, there are organized mass-screening programs for breast cancer by mammography (100% of the population covered at the time of the opinion poll) and for colorectal cancer using Hemoccult (almost 30% of the population covered). In contrast, there is no mass-screening program for prostate cancer and lung cancer. For subjects in the general population, figures indicate the rates of subjects stating that they had undergone at least one screening test. For general practitioners, figures indicate the rates of general practitioners stating that they systematically recommended cancer screening




The corresponding percentages of GPs who stated that they recommended cancer screening tests to their patients were consistent with the proportions of subjects who had undergone screening tests for each tumor type: 68%, 18%, 58%, and 4% of the interviewed GPs stated that they systematically recommended screening for BC, CRC, PC and LC, respectively.

Discussion
In the present study, we describe the adherence to different screening programs for four types of cancers (BC, CRC, PC, and LC) in France. It is important to point out that this opinion poll does not report an accurate incidence of subjects actually screened for cancer but indeed the proportion of subjects stating that they had undergone at least one screening test. It is also worth mentioning that the French national health insurance system currently makes the corresponding screening tests (FOBT, mammography, prostate specific antigen—PSA—testing and X-ray) available for free (or almost free) to all affiliates.

EDIFICE showed, on the one hand, two “rational rates” of screening—high rate of women having undergone mammography and low rate of subjects having performed LC screening—and, on the other hand, two “inadequate rates” of screening—abnormally low rate of CRC screening (nationwide coverage by the on-going program is expected by the end of 2007) and abnormally high rate of PC screening. Even more striking, the French GPs’ behavioral pattern of recommending individual cancer screening exhibited the same inconsistencies.

].
Whereas GPs’ and subjects’ statements in EDIFICE appeared in rather good agreement with respect to the proportions of interviewed subjects having undergone cancer screening tests and of GPs recommending cancer screening to their patients, the reasons put forward why screening tests were not performed are different, indeed even opposite: based on their statements, GPs overestimated the negative impact of fear of the results on subjects’ participation in cancer screening and they underestimated their own role. Nevertheless, both GPs and subjects interestingly seem to attach a more dreadful meaning to the result of BC screening than to the result of CRC screening. Indeed, fear of the result acting as a check upon carrying out cancer screening tests was cited by 18% of the subjects for BC screening whereas only 3% cited this reason for not undergoing CRC screening tests. Comparatively, 44% and 16% of GPs cited fear of the result as the reason for subjects not undergoing BC and CRC screening tests, respectively.
It thus appears that there is a need for more research in social science as well as in biology and public health to improve the effectiveness of cancer screening in the framework of a national health system.
