 < 0.05). Neither sex nor age differences were detected in BRI across studied children and adolescents. The values of Bonn Risk Index were constant during growth and there was a limited influence of age and sex on BRI in children over 3 years of age. The BRI may be valuable in the evaluation of pediatric patients at risk for kidney stones, particularly if the BRI from stone formers is demonstrated to be higher than in normal children.

/L). Prior to inclusion, all participants were screened regarding serum levels of protein, albumin, calcium, phosphate, potassium, uric acid, creatinine and alkaline phosphatase as well as urine concentrations of citrate, oxalate, potassium, calcium and phosphate. Urinary dipstick testing (Bayer Diagnostics, Bridgend, UK) detecting nine parameters, including leukocytes, protein and blood, did not reveal any abnormalities. Children with a family history of kidney stones were excluded from the study. Subjects with diseases known to affect oxalate, calcium and phosphate metabolism and children treated with antibiotics were excluded. All children were screened using renal ultrasound examination to exclude urolithiasis (Toshiba SSH-140A apparatus; probe Convex 3.75 MHz). Participants and their legal guardians gave informed consent, and the study was approved by the Ethical Committee of the Medical University of Bialystok.

For the purpose of plotting the curve of spontaneous crystallization (an association between the number of calcium ions and the amount of added ammonium oxalate leading to the spontaneous crystallization), we used the computer program with the range of values as a scatterplot with the option of adding curves.

). However, statistical analysis did not show significant differences between the age subgroups. The minimum value of BRI was 0.02 1/L, and was found in 11-year-old children, whereas the maximum value was 3.1 1/L in children aged 10 and 17 years. The BRI values for older children corresponding to the 5th percentile ranged between 0.05 and 0.13 1/L, whilst the 95th percentile was from 1.69–2.66 1/L.
The crystallization values of CaOx, based on BRI in healthy children aged 3–18, did not exceed 2.66 1/L. No significant differences were found in the BRI values between boys and girls in either age group.

 and BRI/kg behaved similarly. High correlations between BRI, BRI and body weight, and BRI and body surface area of studied subjects enable practical, more objective use of BRI and allow for comparisons between individuals. For this reason, these results are presented as median values with ranges for the 5th to 95th percentiles for the whole study group.
The study has several limitations. So far, the use of our normative data appears to be limited to the Polish population. It is difficult to relate the results to other geographical regions or to different ethnic groups as there are no published data regarding BRI in children. Further comparative and prospective investigations are needed because a cross-sectional study is not able to reveal whether some children with a normal BRI value will be at risk for stone disease in the future. Moreover, some studied children may have had urolithiasis despite normal results of renal ultrasound. However, this study provided consistent normative data on BRI, due to both the large age representation and the stringent selection criteria.
In summary, the Bonn Risk Index, expressed as the ratio of ionized calcium to the amount of ammonium oxalate necessary to initiate spontaneous CaOx urinary crystal formation, is lower in healthy children and adolescents aged 3–18 years than in studies of adults by other authors. The BRI during growth appears to be independent of age and sex. Thus, our results may contribute to the effective screening of kidney stone disease in pediatric subjects. We conclude that the BRI may be valuable in the evaluation of pediatric patients at risk for kidney stones, particularly if the BRI from stone formers is demonstrated to be higher than in normal children.
