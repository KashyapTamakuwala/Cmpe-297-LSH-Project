t
 tests were used to compare VAS scores in the three groups, before and after the intervention. Entonox and pethidine decreased the pain score significantly, while compressed air did not. There was no significant difference between pain relief by Entonox and pethidine. This study demonstrates for the first time that inhalational Entonox is an effective analgesic regimen for ESWL. Entonox can be regarded as an appropriate alternative to analgesics like opioids in relieving pain during ESWL.

The aim of this study was to compare the clinical efficacy of inhalational Entonox and pethidine for pain relief during outpatient ESWL.

Methods
A total of 150 patients (97 men and 53 women) with stones located in the renal pelvicalyceal system were prospectively randomized to receive Entonox (prefixed equimolar nitrous oxide and oxygen mixture), pethidine, or compressed air for sedoanalgesia during lithotripsy with a third generation electromagnetic lithotripter (Dornier Compact Delta magneto lithotripter).
After institutional review board approval, written informed consent was obtained during the anesthesia consultation, which was performed at least 48 h before ESWL. During this consultation, the method of pain assessment was explained to the patients. Patients were asked to rate their pain on a scale from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain).
Patients were included in the study if they were older than 15 years of age, had pelvicalyceal stones, and understood the pain scoring. Patients were excluded from the trial if they had any of the following: (1) serum creatinine > 200 μmol/l; (2) history of chronic use of analgesics and/or sedatives; (3) allergy to any of the study medications; or (4) history of middle ear surgery within the previous month.
Just before entering the lithotripsy room, the patients were randomly assigned to one of the three treatment groups (Entonox, pethidine, 1 mg/kg intravenously over 10 min, or compressed air, each to be provided if the patient asked for pain relief during ESWL) by opening a sealed envelope. All patients were assessed by a single physician who was blinded to the patient group assignment. All patients received no premedication and they were told not to eat or drink for at least 4 h prior to the procedure.
The control group received compressed air, followed by Entonox gas if pain relief was considered inadequate by the patient.
Pain was assessed before and 2 min after receiving pain medication by using a visual analogue scale (VAS) with two anchor points, zero denoting no pain and ten for the worst pain the patient had ever experienced.
Statistical analysis
t
 test was used to analyze VAS score before and after medication. Comparison of means (VAS decrease) in the three groups was performed using one-way ANOVA. Comparison of percentages was performed using Chi-square analysis.

Several studies have compared different local and systemic analgesia regimens for pain relief during ESWL, but this, to our knowledge, is the first randomized clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of Entonox in the treatment of ESWL-associated pain.

]. Further studies are, therefore, warranted to compare the efficacy and safety of Entonox with those of other analgesic regimens.

Conclusions
Entonox can provide easy, rapid, and adequate pain relief for patients undergoing ESWL, and is associated with few and minimal side effects.
