Objective
Sepsis intervention studies need better patient stratification methods, and one way to realize this is the introduction of stable biomarkers. A set of recently developed novel biomarkers, based upon precursor-fragments of short-lived hormones, was previously shown to be increased during sepsis. However, it is not known whether these biomarkers are influenced by sepsis intervention strategies. Therefore we investigated the markers in a model of human endotoxemia intervened by increasing doses of prednisolone.

Design and setting
Prospective, open-label study in a specialized clinical research unit of a university hospital.

Subjects
Thirty-two healthy male volunteers.

Interventions
n
Escherichia coli
 lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (4 ng/kg). Blood samples were drawn during 24 h after LPS injection.

Measurements and results
LPS injection caused an increase in levels of midregional pro-adrenomedullin (MR-proADM), midregional pro-atrial natriuretic peptide (MR-proANP), C-terminal pro-arginine–vasopressin (CT-proAVP) and procalcitonin (PCT). Prednisolone caused a dose dependent inhibition of MR-proADM, MR-proANP and CT-proAVP levels.

Conclusions
These results show that a set of novel, highly stable sepsis biomarkers was increased during human endotoxemia and was dose-dependently inhibited by corticosteroid pre-treatment.

]. In theory, the biomarker assays may measure levels of both cut prohormone fragments and full-length prohormones. However, the meaning of this relationship remains unclear in plasma because no well-defined methods are currently available for measurement of full-length prohormone plasma levels.

]. With these limitations in mind, we demonstrate here that the levels of the novel biomarkers MR-proADM, MR-proANP, CT-proAVP and PCT are all increased after LPS injection, and that the levels of MR-proADM, MR-proANP and CT-proAVP can be inhibited by prednisolone. These results add to their potential as biomarkers in sepsis.
