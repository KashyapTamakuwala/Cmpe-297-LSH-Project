]. This is particularly important, as many obstetricians are unfamiliar with disability-related complications. A multidisciplinary approach, which involves nursing and social work, can further improve pregnancy outcomes. This shared approach to pregnancy management can also increase the level of comfort for women with disabilities, by knowing that more than one health care provider is looking out for their well-being.

An increasing number of women with disabilities are becoming pregnant. Despite this little is known about the reproductive experiences of these women. Population-based data describing the reproductive experiences of women with disabilities is virtually non-existent. Currently, disability is not regularly included in national or statewide surveys and surveillance tools related to pregnancy. Consequently, the true magnitude of health concerns, including reproductive issues, facing women with disabilities is largely unknown. To improve our understanding of these issues, disability should be included as a demographic variable in all national and state-level surveys addressing reproductive health issues.
All women of childbearing age, including women with disabilities, should have access to preconception care that addresses the medical, psychological and social impacts of pregnancy. Women with disabilities can and do have healthy pregnancies. Accurate knowledge of disabling conditions and a shared multidisciplinary approach to pregnancy management are critical components for good pregnancy outcomes among women with disabilities.
