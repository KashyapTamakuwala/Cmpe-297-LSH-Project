In all higher nonhuman primates, species survival depends upon safe carrying of infants clinging to body hair of adults. In this work, measurements of mechanical properties of ape hair (gibbon, orangutan, and gorilla) are presented, focusing on constraints for safe infant carrying. Results of hair tensile properties are shown to be species-dependent. Analysis of the mechanics of the mounting position, typical of heavier infant carrying among African apes, shows that both clinging and friction are necessary to carry heavy infants. As a consequence, a required relationship between infant weight, hair–hair friction coefficient, and body angle exists. The hair–hair friction coefficient is measured using natural ape skin samples, and dependence on load and humidity is analyzed. Numerical evaluation of the equilibrium constraint is in agreement with the knuckle-walking quadruped position of African apes. Bipedality is clearly incompatible with the usual clinging and mounting pattern of infant carrying, requiring a revision of models of hominization in relation to the divergence between apes and hominins. These results suggest that safe carrying of heavy infants justify the emergence of biped form of locomotion. Ways to test this possibility are foreseen here.

). Mechanical analyses of constraints for safe infant carrying in the usual primate pattern are reported. Measurements of tensile and friction properties of hominoid hairs are presented and conditions for mechanical equilibrium determined. The usual pattern of primate carrying of heavy infants is shown to be incompatible with bipedalism. This brings a new perspective to the hominization process and to the basic changes at the divergence between apes and hominins.

robust
 conclusion can be thus extracted. It is clear that to withstand the clinging infant weight, a large number of hairs held together is required. Results obtained evidence that bunches of about 100 hairs are necessary to carry infants weighing a few kilogram-force. Infant hands (and feet) can possibly grasp a bunch of hairs available in some square centimeters of skin so that safety in the usual pattern of nonhuman primate infant carrying critically depends on the density of hairs.

). This ensures safety for carrying their light young in their acrobatic arboreal life. The arboreal but heavier orangutans (adult females weigh around 50 kgf and males 90 kgf) compensate the lower hair density by longer, thicker, and stronger hairs and thicker skin. Orangutan infants live with their mothers for about 7 years.

 value, combined with hair density and length, indicates that load up to 40 kgf could be supported by clinging. However, the weight limit for clinging depends also on several other variables. Increase in hair pull-out or break in the dynamic situation, capacity of the infant to withstand its own weight and to grasp hairs without sliding, and skin capacity to withstand the load without rupture are all variables that may decrease the infant weight limit for clinging.

It may be concluded that slipping imposes clear limits on the maximum body angle attained by heavy ape species carrying infants, representing a hindrance against evolution towards bipedality. This might explain the persistence of knuckle-walking among the great African apes.

, corresponding to the solution adopted by quadruped savanna monkeys in the arid savanna. It seems clear that habitual bipedalism would not be reached by continuous increase of the body angle. However, among hominoids, reduction of friction between infant fingers and mother hairs could reduce infant grasping capacity, increasing the period of mother’s manual support of newborns and eventually inducing habitual bipedalism.

Concluding remarks and future perspectives
An important conclusion from this work refers to interest in systematic study of tensile properties of hairs from an evolutionary point of view. The other clear conclusion is that models on locomotion and bipedalism evolution must focus on females carrying infants, who are the target of the strongest selective pressures, and this conclusion is independent of the form of locomotion of hominid ancestors (knuckle-walkers, terrestrial or arboreal quadrupeds, or full-time arboreal climbers).
To disentangle the divergence between apes and hominins, several directions of research become clear from this work. Studies of living apes focused on the mechanical problem of infant carrying, as well as determination of the elastic limits of the ape skin and the limits for grasping capacity of ape infants, which are all essential to identify the critical factor responsible for emergence of bipedalism.
It should be stressed that in a scenario with bipedalism emerging for safe infant carrying, the selective pressure would act particularly on females. This is not a problem, as only genes in the nonrecombinant part of the Y chromosome are not transmitted to both sexes and therefore cannot be associated with species locomotion. The process correlates with increase in the mother–infant bond, characteristic of the human lineage.

). It has dramatic effects on skin but is present in many hair shampoos and lacquer.
In order to test the effect on hair tensile properties, ten single human hairs from two volunteers with long hairs (five from a blond woman and five from a man with brown hair) were each cut in three pieces of about 6 cm. Three hair treatments were performed: one piece remained as control, and two pieces were immersed in formaldehyde (36% aqueous solution) for a week; one dried afterwards and the other immersed in baths of distilled water for hours before drying. Each piece of hair was examined under an optical microscope before and after treatment and thickness measured in three positions along its length. The average of such three values was considered in further analysis of the five treatment procedures (control plus before and after two treatments). The ten single hairs gave a total of 150 measurements of hair thickness ∅ (10 × 3 × 5).
The treatment had some effect on hair external appearance, as formaldehyde straightened curled hairs, and water restored curls. Only one piece out of ten treated with formaldehyde and not washed afterwards broke into small pieces and revealed under the microscope inner corrosion due to damage to the cuticle; none of the ten pieces washed after treatment showed such damage. One of the smaller pieces of the damaged hair was kept for the tensile study.
Tensile curves of the 30 pieces of human hairs were measured under the same condition as ape hairs. The small piece of the damaged hair showed abnormal tensile curve, which was discarded. Several statistical tests were performed to analyze values of tensile parameters and ∅.
