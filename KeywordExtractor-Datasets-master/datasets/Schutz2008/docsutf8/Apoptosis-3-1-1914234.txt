Background
Hyperhomocysteinaemia (HHC) is thought to be a risk factor for cardiovascular disease including heart failure. While numerous studies have analyzed the role of homocysteine (Hcy) in the vasculature, only a few studies investigated the role of Hcy in the heart. Therefore we have analyzed the effects of Hcy on isolated cardiomyocytes.

-Hcy) induced apoptosis and necrosis. This loss of cell viability was accompanied by a thread-to-grain transition of the mitochondrial reticulum, ATP depletion and nuclear NOX2 expression coinciding with ROS production as evident from the presence of nitrotyrosin residues. Notably, only at this concentration we found a significant increase in S-adenosylhomocysteine which is considered the primary culprit in HHC.

Conclusion
We found concentration-dependent effects of Hcy in cardiomyocytes, varying from induction of reversible flip-flop of the plasma membrane phospholipids, to apoptosis and necrosis.

Polyclonal α-Nitrotyrosine IgG (1:50) (Molecular Probes Inc, Eugene, OR, USA) was used as an antibody to measure nitrotyrosin residues which is an indicator for ROS production. In this case, Cy5-labeled goat-anti-rabbit-Ig (1:50) (Jackson Immuno Research, West Grove, PA, USA) was used as a secondary antibody. Isotype controls and PBS were used to determine aspecific binding. Monoclonal antibody 1501R against pan-actin (1:6000; Chemicon International, Inc, Temecula, CA, USA) was used as a loading control for the western blot analysis.

Detection of caspase-3 activity
Cells were grown in a 96−wells plate (20,000 cells/well). After treatment with Hcy and/or Z-VAD FMK, cells were lysed and incubated with DEVD-rhodamine 110 substrate (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) for 1 h at 37°C. Subsequently the amount of free rhodamine was determined at a microplate fluorescence reader (TECAN spectrafluor, Switzerland). The developed fluorochrome was proportional to the concentration of activated caspase-3 and could be quantified by a calibration curve of diluted free rhodamine. Each condition was measured in triplo per measurement (total of three measurements).

Immunofluoresence microscopy
To measure the expression of NOX2 and the putative formation of nitrotyrosin, cells were incubated with or without Hcy for 24 h in the 4-well chamber slides (Nalge Nunc International, Naperville, IL, USA). Cells were washed with PBS and fixated with 4% formaldehyde for 10 min at 37°C. Cells were subsequently washed with PBS, permeabilized with acetone–methanol (70%–30%) for 10 min at −20°C, and then washed again with PBS/Tween-20 (0.05% (v/v) Tween-20 in PBS). Subsequently cells were incubated with primary antibodies against NOX2 and nitrotyrosin for 60 min at room temperature followed by incubation overnight at 4°C. PBS and isotype controls were also tested to determine nonspecific binding of the antibodies and background signal. The following day the cells were washed with PBS/Tween and incubated with the secondary antibodies for 30 min at room temperature. After subsequent washes in PBS/Tween and PBS, the slides were covered in mounting medium containing DAPI (Vector Laboratories Inc, Burlingame, CA, USA) to visualize nuclei. Thereafter the slides were covered with coverslips.

Western blot analysis
After treatment H9c2 cells were harvested into modified ELB lysis buffer (250 mM NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mM HEPES pH 7.0, 5 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM DTT) wherein protease inhibitor cocktail (PIC, 1:40; Sigma) was added, and the cell suspension was mixed rigorously and then incubated for 30 min on ice. After determination of the protein concentration of the samples with the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA), reducing sample loading buffer (0.25 M TRIS pH 6.8, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), glycerol, 2-mercaptoethanol, bromophenol blue) was added and the samples were mixed and heated at 95°C for 10 min. A total of 50 μg protein of each sample was then subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and analyzed for NOX2 expression with monoclonal antibody 48 (1:250 dilution) and for pan-actin with monoclonal antibody 1501R as a loading control (1:6000), followed by horseradish–peroxidase–conjugated rabbit–anti-mouse immunoglobulins (RαM-HRP; 1:1000 dilution; DakoCytomation, Glostrup, Denmark). The blots were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham Biosciences AB; Uppsala; Sweden). Staining was quantified with a charge-coupled device camera (Fuji Science Imaging Systems; Düsseldorf, Germany) in combination with AIDA Image Analyzer software (Isotopenmessgeräte; Staubenhardt, Germany).

], which is supported in this study by the observation that complete inhibition of caspases by Z-VAD-FMK did not affect this phenotype. The caspase-dependent pathway of apoptosis was, therefore, not yet activated at this concentration of Hcy, probably related to the lack of nuclear nitrotyrosin residues.

 is modified in a concentration-dependent manner, and thereby supports the concept that Hcy-induced apoptosis mainly follows the mitochondrial pathway, also in cardiomyocytes. However, in addition we found that translocation of NOX2 to the nucleus coinciding with the presence of nitrotyrosin residues indicative for ROS production is even more important in the effector phase of the process of apoptosis induction in cardiomyocytes.

]. To our knowledge, no reports have yet been published on the effect of Hcy on cardiomyocytes specifically. Our study now clearly indicates that Hcy, and possible SAH, indeed affects also cardiomyocytes, primarily by inducing apoptosis/necrosis in a concentration-dependent manner, in which nuclear ROS production, related to nuclear NOX2 expression, is crucial.
