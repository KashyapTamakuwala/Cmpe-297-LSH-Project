In the past years, identification of alternative splicing (AS) variants has been gaining momentum. We developed AVATAR, 
          a database for documenting AS using 5,469,433 human EST sequences and 26,159 human mRNA sequences.  AVATAR contains 
          12000 alternative splicing sites identified by mapping ESTs and mRNAs with the whole human genome sequence. AVATAR 
          also contains AS information for 6 eukaryotes. We mapped EST alignment information into a graph model where exons 
          and introns are represented with vertices and edges, respectively. AVATAR can be queried using, (1) gene names, 
          (2) number of identified AS events in a gene, (3) minimal number of ESTs supporting a splicing site, etc. as search 
          parameters. The system provides visualized AS information for queried genes.

] To address this problem we used EST (short, single pass cDNA 
      sequences generated from randomly selected library clones produced in a high throughput manner from different tissues, 
      individuals and conditions) and mRNA sequences to detect AS variants. The detected variants (using 5,469,433 EST and 
      26,159 mRNA sequences) were stored in a database called AVATAR.
Although, AS databases are available in the public domain, not many contain AS information for multiple eukaryotes 
      (a comparison summarized in AVATAR web site). Therefore, it is important to document AS information for multiple 
      eukaryotes. Hence, we developed AVATAR containing AS information for six eukaryotes. Here, we describe AVATAR development, 
      its content and utility.

Methodology

] Gene information and 
      mRNA sequence were downloaded from the NCBI RefSeq project.

Identification of AS

 panel A and B). The matched regions and gaps correspond to exons and introns, respectively. EST and mRNA 
      alignments with scores greater than 94% were used for further analysis.

Step 2:
      Clustering EST and mRNA
Figure 1
 panel C). EST and mRNA with overlapping 
      regions were then assembled together.

Step 3:
      Detection of AS sites
The mapping of EST alignment with genome sequence to intron positions helps to identify skipped exons and 
					included exons.
      



Searching AVATAR
AVATAR can be queried using keywords. The keywords include accession number, gene name, gene isoform, gene location, 
      cytogenetic locations, chromosome number and number of AS events. The database search produces AS visuals for queried gene.
      

Utility to the Biological Community
AVATAR is a collection of AS information for 6 eukaryotic organisms. The database can be queried simultaneously for 6 
      organisms. It can also be searched using gene names and desired number of AS events. EST sequences are error prone resulting 
      in the detection of aberrant transcripts. Frequency of EST alignment at a specific site provides improved detection in AVATAR.
      

Caveats
AS information on paralogous genes in eukaryotic genomes are not included in AVATAR due to the difficulty in identifying 
      their corresponding chromosomal locations using EST sequences.      

Future developments
New EST sequences are generated in laboratories every day. Hence, it is a time consuming to keep AS databases updated due 
      to the growth of genome and mRNA sequences. Hence, we are in the process of developing a computer agent which can update AVATAR 
      automatically. We also plan to include tumor specific AS data.
