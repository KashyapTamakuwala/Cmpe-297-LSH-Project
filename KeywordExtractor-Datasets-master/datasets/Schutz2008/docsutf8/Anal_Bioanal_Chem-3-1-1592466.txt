A capillary-assembled microchip (CAs-CHIP), prepared by simply embedding square capillaries in a lattice polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) channel plate with the same channel dimensions as the outer dimensions of the square capillaries, has been used as a diffusion-based pretreatment attachment in capillary electrophoresis (CE). Because the CAs-CHIPs employ square-section channels, diffusion-based separation of small molecules from sample solutions containing proteins is possible by using the multilayer flow formed in the square section channel. When a solution containing high-molecular-weight and low-molecular-weight species makes contact with a buffer solution, the low-molecular-weight species, which have larger diffusion coefficients than the high-molecular-weight species, can be collected in a buffer-solution phase. The collected solution containing the low-molecular-weight species is introduced into the separation capillary to be analyzed by CE. This type of system can be used for CE analysis in which pretreatment is required to remove proteins. In this work a fluorescently labeled protein and rhodamine-based molecules were chosen as model species and a feasibility study was performed.

]. Because the CAs-CHIP employs a square-shaped channel structure, however, the characteristic multilayer flow formed in the square section channel can also be used as a useful pretreatment process which can be integrated. The CAs-CHIP is, therefore, expected to enable the integration of universal pretreatment processes by using different kinds of chemically-functionalized capillary and multilayer flow-based chemical processes; this is usually difficult to achieve using other reported techniques.
In this paper, we report preliminary results concerning the preparation of a CAs-CHIP as a deproteinization attachment for CE separation. Deproteinization was achieved by use of the multilayer flow obtained in the PDMS microchannel, and the small molecules separated from the mixed protein sample were injected into the separation capillary connected directly to the CAs-CHIP, to be analyzed by CE. In this work a fluorescently labeled protein and rhodamine-based molecules were chosen as model species, and feasibility study was performed.

. Immediately after injection, high voltage was applied manually by use of a standard high-voltage power supply (Matsusada Precision, Shiga, Japan).

Capturing fluorescence images and laser-induced fluorescence measurement
Fluorescence images of the microchannel were obtained by using an optical/fluorescence inverted microscope (Eclipse TS100-F, Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). Photographs were captured using a 3CCD color camera (HV-D28S, Hitachi Kokusai Electric, Tokyo, Japan) installed at the front port of the microscope. Fluorescent images were collected using a mercury lamp as a light source and a filter block (G-2A and FITC, Nikon, Tokyo, Japan).
CE with laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) detection was performed on a home-built system based on an inverted fluorescence microscope (IX70, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Light at 488 nm from an argon ion laser (Newport Spectra Physics Laser Division, Mountain View, CA, USA) was introduced into the microscope. The laser beam was filtered through a 460–490 nm band-pass filter, reflected by a 510 nm dichroic mirror, then focused on the detection point by means of a 20× objective lens. Fluorescence was collected by use of the same objective lens, filtered through a 515 nm high-pass filter, and finally detected by use of a CCD camera (Model PMA-11, Hamamatsu Photonics, Shizuoka, Japan). To obtain electropherograms fluorescence at 600 nm was used throughout.

]. Here we used this technique to separate small molecules from a mixed protein sample. When the sample solution containing small molecules and proteins made contact with the buffer-solution flow, the small molecules, which have larger diffusion coefficients than the proteins, diffused into the buffer solution. In this study, RB and SR were used as models for small molecules and F-BSA as that for a large molecule.

]. Because these molecular weights are very close to those of the molecules used in this study, an approximately tenfold difference between the diffusion coefficients of the small and large molecules enabled successful separation of small molecules from mixed protein sample solution. Although the difference between diffusion coefficients is a primary principle of diffusion-based separation, it should be noted that the optimum conditions may change, depending on the concentration ratio of the protein and small molecules. Therefore, careful optimization experiments may be required when the concentrations of the small molecules are very low.

Conclusions
We have demonstrated deproteinization and CE separation on a single device using CAs-CHIP technology. Diffusion-based deproteinization in a CAs-CHIP was successfully achieved by choosing an appropriate flow rate, and subsequent CE separation of small molecules was achieved by use of a separation capillary connected directly to the CAs-CHIP.
Because diffusion-based separation is, in general, based on dilution of the sample solution, preconcentration before CE separation will be required in the next step. Because the CAs-CHIP is prepared by simply embedding square capillaries, however, further integration of the preconcentration process using chemically-functionalized capillaries, or the on-line preconcentration techniques reported to date, can be also used. These applications are currently under investigation.
