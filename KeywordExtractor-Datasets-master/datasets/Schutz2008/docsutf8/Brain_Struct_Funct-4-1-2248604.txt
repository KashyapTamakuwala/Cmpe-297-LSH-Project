The aim of this study was to dissociate the contributions of memory-based (cognitive) and adaptation-based (sensory) mechanisms underlying deviance detection in the context of natural speech. Twenty healthy right-handed native speakers of English participated in an event-related design scan in which natural speech stimuli, /de:/ (“deh”) and /deI/ (“day”); (/te:/ (“teh”) and /teI/ (“tay”) served as standards and deviants within functional magnetic resonance imaging event-related “oddball” paradigm designed to elicit the mismatch negativity component. Thus, “oddball” blocks could involve either a word deviant (“day”) resulting in a “word advantage” effect, or a non-word deviant (“deh” or “tay”). We utilized an experimental protocol controlling for refractoriness similar to that used previously when deviance detection was studied in the context of tones. Results showed that the cognitive and sensory mechanisms of deviance detection were located in the anterior and posterior auditory cortices, respectively, as was previously found in the context of tones. The cognitive effect, that was most robust for the word deviant, diminished in the “oddball” condition. In addition, the results indicated that the lexical status of the speech stimulus interacts with acoustic factors exerting a top-down modulation of the extent to which novel sounds gain access to the subject’s awareness through memory-based processes. Thus, the more salient the deviant stimulus is the more likely it is to be released from the effects of adaptation exerted by the posterior auditory cortex.

Methods
Subjects
Twenty right-handed adult healthy subjects, native speakers of English, 8 women and 12 men, participated in the study. Subjects ranged in age from 23 to 28. All subjects gave informed consent to participate in the study.

Experimental protocol
2005
). Each subject participated in 12 functional imaging runs. The speech stimuli were grouped into two types of blocks “oddball” and “control”. In the first type of block, the “oddball” block, deviant exemplars occurred quasi-randomly embedded within standard stimuli so that the frequency of occurrence throughout the block was balanced among exemplars. The interval between two successive deviants varied quasi-randomly with gaps of 4, 6, 8, 10 or 12 standards with the constraint that gap size was balanced throughout the block. In the “Oddball” blocks deviants appeared 42 times out of a total of 354 stimuli (probability of occurrence = 12%).
In the “control” blocks the same physical deviants and standards as in the “oddball” blocks (deviant-counterparts and standard-counterparts, respectively), occurred quasi-randomly, while deviants were constrained by the same spacing rule mentioned above. However, each of the “control” blocks contained eight different equiprobable stimuli, including the deviant and standard counterparts. Thus, in the control runs the seven stimuli beside the deviant-counterpart served as “filler” or contextual stimuli which were added to the sequence so that the deviant-counterpart will appear at the same probability as any other stimulus in the sequence. Each of the stimuli in the “control” block (a total of eight different stimuli) repeated 42 times and appeared with equal probability which was identical to that of the deviants in the “oddball” block (12%). There were three blocks of each type (“oddball”/“control”). Each block was repeated twice. In total, 12 blocks of approximately 6 min each were randomly presented for each subject within a session.
Three non-words, /de:/ “deh”; /te:/ “teh”; and /teI/ “tay”, and one word, /deI/ “day”, were recorded from a male native English speaker in a sound-proof chamber. These stimuli comprised the following standard-deviant pairs that resulted in the three “oddball” runs: (1) deh (standard)–day (deviant); (2) day–deh and (3) teh–tay. Thus, “deh” and “day” swapped their roles as standard and deviant in the second “oddball” block, whereas the third block controlled for the acoustic change associated with the transition from a monophthong (/e:/) to a diphthong (/eI/) occurring in the first standard-deviant pair. Additional four stimuli, /pe:/ “peh”; /peI/ “pay”; /be:/ “beh”; and /beI/ “bay”, together with the previous four mentioned above were embedded within three control runs, each containing a deviant-counterpart , either “day”, “deh” or “tay” appearing with the same probability and obeying the same spacing rule as in the oddball blocks.

The reason for using three tokens for each consonant-vowel stimulus was to control as much as possible for acoustic factors, other than those inherent in the structure of the stimulus, which could confound the elicitation of a deviant response. Using three different exemplars for each consonant-vowel (CV) stimulus diminished the likelihood of a contingency developing between a specific deviant-standard pair because of an uncontrolled acoustic facet associated with either the deviant or the standard.

The numbers attached to the stimuli indicate different exemplars of the same CV stimulus. Each contrast was computed across all exemplars of a specific CV. In the “oddball” sequence “day1” serves as a deviant and “deh1” functions as a standard. In the “control” condition “deh3” is a standard control counterpart and “day2” serves as a deviant control counterpart

Behavioral assessment of discrimination between stimuli
Thirteen subjects (out of the 20 participating in the study) rated the stimuli in a behavioral session performed outside of the magnet. The behavioral assessment was carried out in a different session. Stimuli were presented simultaneously with recorded MR scanner noise. The stimuli and the scanner noise were both presented in 62 dB SPL which was a convenient hearing level for both the stimuli and the noise presented together.
Subjects were presented with “triplets” comprised of stimuli containing /e:/ and /eI/. In each block, 15 triplets were presented separated by a 2 s interval of silence allowing the subject to respond. The stimuli were the same as those presented in the fMRI experiment. There were several patterns of triplet presentation in each block, as follows. There were three triplets in which “day” was presented first followed by two “deh”-s; three triplets in which “day” was presented last and preceded by two “deh”-s; three triplets where “deh” was presented first followed by two “day”-s and three triplets were “deh” was last and preceded by two “day”-s. In addition, there were three triplets in which “day”, “deh” and “tay” each appeared in the middle position, respectively, while the neighboring stimuli (in the first and third positions) where either the /eI/ or /e:/ counterparts (i.e., “deh” “day” “deh”; “day” “deh” “day” and “teh “tay” “teh”).
Overall, four blocks of 15 triplets each were presented to the subjects. The order of triplets was randomized within each block. The three different exemplars representing each CV stimulus were balanced across the four blocks. The subjects were required to indicate the outlier in each triplet by pressing the key (either “1”,”2” or “3” on the keyboard) that corresponded to the position of the outlier in the triplet. The outliers were assigned mainly to the extreme positions (1 or 3) in the triplet to simulate more closely the “oddball” design in which the deviant is surrounded by repetitive standards. The trials with the outlier appearing in the middle position were introduced to minimize the probability of guessing the identity of the third stimulus in the triplet after hearing the first two which were non-identical. Thus, subjects could guess the identity of the outlier with more confidence only after hearing two identical stimuli in a row.

Data acquisition parameters
Data was collected on a 3T Siemens Trio scanner. Each study began with two localizers: a three-plane localizer and a multiple-slice sagittal localizer. These were followed by the acquisition of twenty-five 6 mm T1-weighted axial slices (TR = 300 ms, TE = 2.47 ms, flip angle = 60°, FOV = 220 mm, 256 acquisition matrix). For each subject, 12 functional imaging scans were collected with slices in the same locations as the anatomical T1-weighted data. Functional images were recorded using a gradient-echo EPI sequence (TR = 1,550 ms, TE = 30 ms, flip angle = 80°, FOV = 220 mm, 64 acquisition matrix). Each functional run involved the acquisition of 245 volumes with twenty-five 6-mm axial slices. Images were converted to analyze format and the first ten volumes of each functional series were removed to account for the approach to steady-state magnetization, leaving 235 volumes for analysis.

Functional image data were motion corrected by realigning the time sequence imaging to the first image in the middle run of the sequence using SPM99.

). The data were normalized to a signal measure of 100 and were spatially smoothed with a 8.08 mm Gaussian kernel to account for variations in the location of activation across participants. The output maps are normalized beta-maps which are in the acquired space (3.44 mm × 3.44 mm × 6 mm).

Statistical analyses
We used a two-stage random-effects model to analyze the data. In the first stage, statistical maps were calculated in the comparison of interest for each subject as described above. In the second stage, across subject analyses were conducted and the distribution of the individual subjects’ statistics were tested for significance.

The non-word “tay” was excluded from the baseline, since it was the only non-word with a diphthong (/eI/), and to avoid contrasting it with itself.

Across subject analyses
Composite maps.
 Two types of composites were created: three composites of deviant maps, one for each deviant (“deh”, “day”, “tay”) and three composites of the deviant-control maps, one composite for each control run that included either “deh”, “day” or “tay” as a deviant-counterpart, respectively.

Reaction time is given for each of the three positions in the triplet and for each stimulus that served as a deviant in the “oddball” blocks. ±Standard deviation



This confirms our prediction that reaction time will be shorter in case of an outlier presented in the third position following two identical stimuli. However, the fact that the main effect of Stimulus as well as the interaction between Stimulus and Position did not reach significance confirms that the stimuli were equally discriminable in the context of the “oddball” paradigms used in this experiment.

Thus, the positive differential BOLD observed in the ACC and in the frontal gyrus is a direct result of contrasting “deh” with a baseline of “day” deviants to create the map reflecting the sensory component for “deh” standard.
