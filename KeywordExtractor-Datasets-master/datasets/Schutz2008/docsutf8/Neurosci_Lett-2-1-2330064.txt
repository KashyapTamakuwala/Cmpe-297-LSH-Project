. Baseline measurements of fluorescence were calculated as a mean of the 10 s of recording prior to agonist application. Peak changes in fluorescence for neuronal and glial cells were expressed as a ratio of the baseline (increases in fluorescence are expressed as a self-ratio, baseline value is 1).

. Phospho ERK intensity was corrected for loading using non-phosphorylated ERK blotting and expressed as fold over basal.

. PCR reactions were carried out with 2 μl of cDNA and a final concentration of 500 nM of each primer. Amplification took place in a Techne Genius PCR machine (Techne, Cambridge, UK) using the following protocol: denaturation at 94 °C for 5 min; repeated cycles of denaturation at 94 °C, followed by annealing at 57 °C and extension at 72 °C, each for 30 s; final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. Thirty-five cycles were used. The amplification products were examined by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel and visualized using ethidium bromide under UV light.
