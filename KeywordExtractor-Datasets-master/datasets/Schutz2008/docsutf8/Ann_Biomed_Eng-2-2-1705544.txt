Motivated by our interest in examining meniscal mechanotransduction processes, we report on the validation of a new tissue engineering bioreactor. This paper describes the design and performance capabilities of a tissue engineering bioreactor for cyclic compression of meniscal explants. We showed that the system maintains a tissue culture environment equivalent to that provided by conventional incubators and that its strain output was uniform and reproducible. The system incorporates a linear actuator and load cell aligned together in a frame that is contained within an incubator and allows for large loads and small displacements. A plunger with six Teflon-filled Delrin compression rods is attached to the actuator compressing up to six tissue explants simultaneously and with even pressure. The bioreactor system was used to study proteoglycan (PG) breakdown in porcine meniscal explants following various input loading tests (0–20% strain, 0–0.1 MPa). The greatest PG breakdown was measured following 20% compressive strain. These strain and stress levels have been shown to correspond to partial meniscectomy. Thus, these data suggest that removing 30–60% of meniscal tissue will result in the breakdown of meniscal tissue proteoglycans.

 This altered loading state may cause a direct breakdown of matrix components such as proteoglycans (PG), or indirectly affect matrix production by induction of catabolic biomolecules.
The objectives of this study were (1) to design and build a practical, cost-effective device for applying homogeneous strains to tissue explants, and (2) to utilize the system to overload and underload meniscal tissue and measure the biochemical output. In this communication, we show that the ensuing device is a simple biocompatible design that applies accurate and reproducible strains and is made of components that can be sterilized. We utilized the bioreactor to apply both load and displacement controlled dynamic compression tests. Dynamic strain compression tests showed PG breakdown following overloading of meniscal tissue. No significant changes in concentration of PG released to the conditioned media was measured following various levels of dynamic compressive stress. A comparison between stress controlled dynamic compression versus strain controlled dynamic compression was also made.

A strain gage load cell (Model 1210AF, Interface, Scottsdale, AZ) with a load capacity of 1334 N (sensitivity of ∼1.3 N) was utilized. For tests that require loads near or above 1334 N, a dimensionally identical load cell with 8896 N (sensitivity ∼2.17 N) (Interface, Scottsdale, AZ, USA) capacity is interchangeable with the current load cell. This design feature of interchangeable load cells allows for a larger range of loads to be accurately measured. A 2100 series signal conditioner (Vishay Instruments, Raleigh, NC, USA) amplifies the load cell signal to produce a 5 V signal at the maximum load.

Accuracy Evaluation of the System
Ultra-low pressure film (Sensor Products Inc., East Hanover, NJ, USA) was used to measure well pressure during compression. First, the repeatability of the pressure film was tested by loading the film (seven times) between flat platens in a tensile testing machine (Model 8872, Instron Corp., Canton, MA, USA) to a 70 N target load, corresponding to a pressure of 0.477 MPa for the given indentor size. Calibration of the pressure film was also done using the tensile testing machine and included loading pieces of pressure film ranging from 0.2 to 1.64 MPa. Pressure film analysis was completed using commercial software (Scion Image, National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) to measure the density of the pressure film samples. Film was compressed between the platens and a piece of rubber similar to the rubber used for testing well pressure.
To determine well pressure in the bioreactor, a machined plate was set on top of the dish with a 3 mm thick piece of uniform rubber. Pressure film was placed on top of the rubber and the plunger was lowered near the surface of the film. Four tests were conducted, each to the same pressure (0.477 MPa) to determine the repeatability of the bioreactor in load control. The film from the bioreactor was analyzed and density measured to determine the difference between each compression rod. The difference in film density and the maximum percentage error was determined to demonstrate the accuracy of the system.

Compliance of the System
The compliance of the system was determined by placing a flat stainless steel plate over the wells and running a load-deformation test in the absence of menisci. The test was repeated three times and the load-deformation data recorded.

Determination of Displacement Repeatability
The micrometer measurements from the body filler showed that the bioreactor was extremely repeatable. Well 3 had the largest standard deviation in height, 3.4 ± 0.01 mm, whereas well 1 had the lowest standard deviation 3.4 ± 0.0015.

DISCUSSION
The explant compression system meets the criteria necessary to obtain a realistic representation of physiological forces present in the knee joint. This system is able to apply known pressures to six explants at once, which is important when trying to gather data for hypothesis testing. It is capable of applying physiological and supraphysiological levels of load and displacement, and has the ability to test in load or displacement control. SMI programming allows for flexibility in frequency, duration, amplitude, and waveform. The system is small enough to fit in a standard incubator and is made of materials that can endure autoclaving and alcohol. An important feature to this system is the ability to keep the explants and media sterile from the culture hood to the incubator. The plunger, dish, and cap form an enclosure that allows easy transport between the culture hood and incubator without allowing open air and bacteria to infect the sample. Since the cap incorporates a linear bearing it does not need to be removed for testing. Utilizing the system features and designing the correct protocol will help maintain a physiological loading sterile environment.

 In addition, the present system is capable of 1 Hz cyclic compression in a sinusoidal wave using displacement or load control. The bioreactor can be used to compress any tissue that fits under an 8 mm compression rod and in a 10 mm deep well. All surfaces are machined to a smooth, frictionless finish, to ensure the sample is exposed to pure unconfined compression. Although we believe this bioreactor to be an improvement over others, we realize that there are some limitations that need to be compensated for. For example, this system can only perform unconfined compression currently. However, the system could be modified to run confined compression tests as well by outfitting a new plunger/well assembly.

 showed that dynamic compression (0.1 MPa for 24 h at 0.5 Hz) increased both GAG synthesis as well as release to the media compared to unloaded controls. Our loading scheme was designed to simulate approximate physiological walking conditions (2 h, 1 Hz). It is difficult to compare our GAG data to a study of a single injurious insult, or dynamic compression for 24 h. We created an approximate daily physiological loading environment that might occur during walking, and simulated loads from unloaded to overloaded due to meniscectomy. In the future, we will investigate the mechanisms of GAG release, whether it is mechanical damage or activation of enzymatic activity.
It was surprising that explants tested at 0.05 MPa showed greater PG breakdown than explants tested at 0.1 MPa for the superficial zone. One possible reason for this result might be related to the cell viability. A compression of 0.1 MPa may induce more cell death than 0.05 MPa of compression and hence fewer cells may be available for production of metalloproteases that may contribute to the breakdown of PG. Current studies are underway to document the degree of cell death in the explants.

 strain, the duration of strain levels, or most likely the loading history. Before definitive clinical implications can be made regarding the effects of meniscectomy on meniscal tissue, we must first determine if the levels of PG breakdown noted in this study correspond to changes in the load-bearing capacity of the tissue and its function in the knee joint.

 Since all samples in this study were bisected, the relative differences found are still significant. It should be noted that the measured response may be due not only to mechanical stimuli but also growth factors released due to cutting the samples. In addition to bisecting the samples, other factors, such as FBS concentration and post-incubation time may effect the absolute concentrations of GAG analyzed in this study. Therefore, only relative comparisons between treatment groups should be considered.
In summary, this simple and practical experimental system allows for reproducible application and quantification of homogeneous stresses or strains to explants tissues, thereby providing a systemic and quantitative method for correlating external mechanical stimuli to cellular and molecular mechanisms of mechanotransduction.
