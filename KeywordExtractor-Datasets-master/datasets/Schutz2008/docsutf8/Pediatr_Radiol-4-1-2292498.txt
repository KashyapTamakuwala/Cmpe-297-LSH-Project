Voiding urosonography (VUS) encompasses examination of the urinary tract with intravesical administration of US contrast agent (UCA) for diagnosis of vesicoureteric reflux (VUR). The real breakthrough for US examination of VUR came with the availability of stabilized UCAs in the mid-1990s. This article presents a comprehensive review of various procedural aspects of VUS. Different US modalities are available for detecting the echogenic microbubbles: fundamental mode, colour Doppler US, harmonic imaging and dedicated contrast imaging with multiple display options. The reflux is graded (1 to 5) in a similar manner to the system used in voiding cystourethrography (VCUG). The most commonly used UCA for VUS, Levovist, is galactose-based and contains air-filled microbubbles. The recommended concentration is 300 mg/ml at a dose of 5–10%, or less than 5%, of the bladder filling volume when using fundamental or harmonic imaging modes, respectively. There are preliminary reports of VUS using a second-generation UCA, SonoVue. Here the UCA volume is less than 1% of the bladder filling volume. There is no specific contraindication to intravesical administration of UCA. The safety profile of intravesical Levovist is very high with no reports of side effects over a decade of use in VUS.

Introduction
Diagnostic imaging for vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) is a common procedure in children. Currently, three modalities are available for reflux diagnosis, namely voiding cystourethrography (VCUG), radionuclide cystography (RNC) and voiding urosonography (VUS). The last of these is carried out using US in combination with intravesical administration of US contrast agent (UCA). This allows the use of ionizing radiation to be avoided, which is not the case in RNC and VCUG. However, in VCUG a marked reduction in radiation dose has been achieved with the introduction of digital pulsed fluoroscopy.

]. The indirect methods for reflux diagnosis were based on US of the urinary tract, without administration of any kind of substance into the bladder. These included depicting various sonomorphological changes of the urinary tract as a result of VUR, detecting newly appearing or an increase in existing ureteral or pelvicalyceal dilatation during voiding and assessing ureteric jet changes with duplex and colour Doppler US. The direct means used to diagnose VUR required instilling different substances intravesically. The most frequently administered fluid was physiological saline solution. Ballooning of the renal pelvis during the filling of the bladder was the criterion for diagnosis of VUR. Application of air bubbles, by shaking the normal saline before administration or adding carbon dioxide, were also tried. US studies were also carried out, in which the empty bladder was solely filled with air. In addition to low diagnostic accuracy, all the above methods had major procedural drawbacks making them impractical for widespread integration into routine imaging.

]. Its very short imaging window of approximately 5 min, however, prevented its routine application. The breakthrough in US diagnosis of VUR in children came about the mid-1990s with the availability of UCAs containing stabilized microbubbles. Levovist (Levograf, Schering Spain, Madrid, Spain; SHU-508-A, Schering, Berlin, Germany) was the first such UCA to become available for clinical use in Europe. This opened the door for rapid development of VUS and its introduction as part of the routine diagnostic imaging option of VUR.

Physicochemical properties
35
]. The effects of power output, transducer frequency and injection rate were found to be comparable to those during IV administration. The physicochemical properties of particular relevance for intravesical use are described below.
Interaction with normal saline solution

]. Collapse of the microbubbles means that echo enhancers are not available. In practice, the use of normal saline solution from plastic containers is preferred.

Interaction with urine
38
]. It is postulated that urea affects the bonding between water molecules and facilitates the formation of more microbubbles. Thus, having some urine in the bladder when performing VUS actually has a positive effect on imaging.

Ascent of microbubbles in the ureter
39
]. Given constancy of gravity, the density difference between gas and fluid and the viscosity of fluid, the velocity of ascent is proportional to the square of the microbubble radius. The typical microbubble radius of Levovist is 1–2.5 μm. Calculation of velocity of ascent indicates that for all practical purposes passive ascent can be excluded. Furthermore, in an in-vitro simulation of VUS with a set-up imitating the worst-case scenario (90°, glass tube (no adsorption), constant stirring of fluid suspension, and absence of counter-flow) the possibility of passive ascent was evaluated using an ultraviolet spectrometer for the detection of microbubbles. The result of this experiment was also negative. These findings suggest that the microbubbles in the ureter do not ascend passively and that reflux pressure is necessary for propagation, particularly in vivo with a constant counter-flow of urine from the renal pelvis to the bladder.



Procedural details

40
]. Optionally, a transperineal US of the urethra and/or cyclical filling of the bladder may be added. Various US modalities are available for performing VUS. The main differences between the modalities are in the degree of conspicuity of the microbubbles and sensitivity of reflux detection.

]. It was possible to detect more reflux with the burst colour Doppler US compared to regular colour Doppler US or fundamental imaging and even VCUG. No systematic evaluation is available regarding the application of power Doppler US for VUS. Overall, adding optimized colour Doppler US to fundamental imaging seems to have some advantage and should be tried when other contrast-specific modalities are not available.

Harmonic imaging
43
]. This may be optimized to receive harmonics from either tissue or microbubbles, thus creating “tissue-specific harmonic imaging” or “contrast-specific harmonic imaging”, respectively. Some US machines only use the second harmonic for imaging (narrow band), whereas others are capable of implementing a wider range of harmonics (wide band). There may be some degree of difference in image quality between these different technical approaches, in general the latter being of higher quality.

Procedural steps
Precontrast scans of the bladder, ureters and kidneys
28
]. Particular attention should to be paid to documentation of subtle changes in the retrovesical region, the vesicoureteric junction and any dilated ureter. The renal pelves (and/or the calyces) are imaged with maximum magnification. A scan in the supine position may suffice if adequate visualization of the renal pelves on both sides is possible, even though scanning the kidneys with the child in the prone position definitely allows better demonstration of the pelvicalyceal system. It should always be kept in mind that not performing a precontrast scan reduces the duration of the whole examination. This should be the case whenever harmonic or other dedicated contrast imaging is used.

Intravesical administration of normal saline and US contrast agent
13
28

28
]. In such a case, turning the child several times from side to side hastens the homogeneous distribution of the UCA in the bladder. The administration of normal saline is continued until the child has the urge to micturate or there is the first slight sign of back pressure to the infusion or injection.

Postcontrast scan of the bladder, ureters and kidneys
28
23
] the need for UCA to demonstrate reflux was again emphasized. They compared indirect non-contrast VUS with contrast-enhanced VUS in 47 children with 93 PUUs. In the former there was no catheterization and bladder filling and any increase in renal pelvic and proximal ureteric width during voiding was considered as a sign of VUR. Compared to VUS with UCA this was found to have low diagnostic accuracy of only 59%, which is not sufficiently reliable for routine use.

Postcontrast scan of the bladder, ureters and kidneys during and after voiding
28
]. Other alternatives to consider are to have the child sit on a potty and to scan the kidneys from the back. A “music potty” that signals voiding with music is helpful. In older boys the option to micturate into a urine bottle while standing and being scanned from the back may be offered. At the end the bladder is checked for residual urine.

]. In this prospective study a total of 146 children (87 boys, 59 girls) with a mean age of 3.3 years (8 days to 14 years) were recruited. In the voiding part of VUS, primarily transperineal US of the urethra was performed. During voiding the catheter was removed. The diameters of the anterior and posterior parts of the urethra were measured at maximum dilatation during voiding. In boys the normal value was found to be 6.1 ± 0.8 mm (2.8–7.1 mm) and 6.3 ± 0.67 mm (3.7–7.2 mm), respectively. In girls the urethral diameter was 4.2 ± 1.0 mm (2.5–7.8 mm). This was the basis for evaluation of pathological changes in the urethra. In all children the US study was followed by VCUG. There were three boys with posterior urethral valves detected on US with dilated posterior urethra, reduced diameter of the anterior urethra and delay in UCA flow at the valve. Furthermore, urethral stenosis was diagnosed in two boys. Seven children were evaluated after resection of the posterior urethra valves and were found to have a normal posterior urethral diameter in the presence of dilatation of the anterior part without any flow delay. In all children these findings were confirmed on VCUG. All girls and 75 boys showed a normal urethra at both transperineal US and VCUG. Thus sensitivity and specificity were each 100%. The approximate mean duration for VUS including transperineal voiding US was 30 min. In conclusion, transperineal contrast-enhanced VUS of the urethra has not only been shown to be possible but also to be a potential adjunct to VUS in routine examinations.

In the first cycle 28 of 35 and in the second 33 of 35 of the PUUs were positive. In the first cycle only just 2 of 35 refluxes (both grade II) were detected. The VUR diagnosed in the second cycle alone comprised six PUUs with grade II and one PUU with grade III reflux. Not only were 25% more refluxing units detected in the second cycle but also 50% more grade III refluxes.

At the end of VUS and bladder emptying there can still be a “layer” of UCA lining the mucosa of the empty bladder. The configuration of the bladder in transverse section in combination with the remaining echogenic UCA resembles the mouth part of a “smile sign”. This sign indicates that there is still sufficient UCA in the bladder and if considered necessary a second filling with normal saline only would suffice to carry out cyclical VUS

Overall, these studies show that the duration of VUS shows a wide range and is longer than that of VCUG. As mentioned above the precontrast US may not be necessary when using harmonic or other dedicated contrast imaging modalities, resulting in a reduction of the duration of VUS by almost one-third. This would put the duration of VUS equivalent to that of VCUG.

]. This osmolality corresponds to that of previously used ionic radiographic contrast agents, which were likewise instilled into the bladder. No adverse events attributable to the osmolality were observed with these agents. Apart from this, the amount of UCA administered is small and in the bladder there is usually urine and/or normal saline, resulting in dilution of the hyperosmolar solution. Hyperosmolality of the UCA can, therefore, be ignored in VUS, particularly as it lies approximately in the physiological range of osmolality of urine. No animal study has been published on the potential effect of insonation of the urothelium in the presence of microbubbles, particularly at high MI settings. Potential alterations of the urothelium cannot be excluded with absolute certainty. Over the last 10 years, predominantly in Europe, it is roughly estimated that some 20,000 VUS examinations have been conducted in children (publications, reports and personal communications). There have been no reports of clinical adverse effects related to the intravesical administration of Levovist.
