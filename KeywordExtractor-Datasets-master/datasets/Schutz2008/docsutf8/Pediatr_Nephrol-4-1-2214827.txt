Arterial hypertension is very common in children with all stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD). While fluid overload and activation of the renin–angiotensin system have long been recognized as crucial pathophysiological pathways, sympathetic hyperactivation, endothelial dysfunction and chronic hyperparathyroidism have more recently been identified as important factors contributing to CKD-associated hypertension. Moreover, several drugs commonly administered in CKD, such as erythropoietin, glucocorticoids and cyclosporine A, independently raise blood pressure in a dose-dependent fashion. Because of the deleterious consequences of hypertension on the progression of renal disease and cardiovascular outcomes, an active screening approach should be adapted in patients with all stages of CKD. Before one starts antihypertensive treatment, non-pharmacological options should be explored. In hemodialysis patients a low salt diet, low dialysate sodium and stricter dialysis towards dry weight can often achieve adequate blood pressure control. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers are first-line therapy for patients with proteinuria, due to their additional anti-proteinuric properties. Diuretics are a useful alternative for non-proteinuric patients or as an add-on to renin–angiotensin system blockade. Multiple drug therapy is often needed to maintain blood pressure below the 90th percentile target, but adequate blood pressure control is essential for better renal and cardiovascular long-term outcomes.

]. Therefore, good antihypertensive management can substantially contribute to better renal and patient survival of adults with childhood-onset CKD.
As in many other complications of chronic renal failure, patients often do not report symptoms of hypertension, so an active screening approach is needed to prevent end-organ damage.
This article aims to give a short overview of the different pathophysiological pathways that lead to hypertension in CKD in order to explain how these can be targeted by different therapeutic approaches.

Once hypertension has been confirmed, good management should not focus only on pharmacological therapy, but also on detection and treatment of end-organ damage and, where appropriate, improvement of the dialysis regime and consideration of therapeutic life-style changes.

Calcium channel blockers are very potent anti-hypertensive drugs and, therefore, useful as add-on therapy in children with resistant hypertension. Dihydropyridine (DHP) drugs (e.g. nifedipine, amlodipine) act mainly as vasodilators and do not have cardiac side effects. Amlodipine has pediatric labeling and is available as a suspension, and doses need not to be adjusted to renal function.

Beta blockers can be used as second-line therapy for renal hypertension in children. However, they are contraindicated in asthma and can cause fatigue. All beta blockers require dose reduction with progression of CKD. They should be used with caution in heart failure, and their adverse metabolic effects make them less suitable for diabetics. The largest clinical experience, especially for infants, is available for propranolol. A sustained-release form of this drug allows once daily administration in larger children. However, other agents, such as atenolol, which have the advantage of being both long acting and β1-selective, may be preferred in clinical practice.
Other drugs are used less commonly, mainly due to their more severe side-effects profiles. Alpha blockers (such as prazosin) can be used in patients who also require them for control of bladder emptying or Raynaud’s phenomenon. Centrally acting alpha agonists (such as clonidine) act via reduction of sympathetic nervous outflow. Rebound hypertension after discontinuation is a major problem of this drug. The vasodilators hydralazine and minoxidil are less suitable in CKD as they are less effective and cause salt and water retention.

Conclusion
Adequate management of hypertension in CKD requires an active screening approach in order to prevent the significant renal deterioration and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality associated with high blood pressure. Owing to the plethora of different pathophysiological mechanisms involved, a whole range of therapeutic options is available. Non-pharmacological options should not be disregarded for obese children or for children on hemodialysis. Inhibitors of the renin–angiotensin system should be preferred for proteinuric patients and, probably, also for non-proteinuric patients. Multiple drug therapy is often necessary to reach target blood pressure below the 90th percentile. For this, diuretics and calcium channel blockers are the most suitable options.


Questions
(Answers appear after the reference list)
is mainly a feature of the later stages of CKD.

is caused by volume overload with normal total peripheral resistance.

increases renal blood flow and, therefore, helps to maintain residual renal function.

can be caused by fluid overload, sympathetic nervous system hyperactivity and/or activation of the renin–angiotensin system.




serum sodium levels are not indicative of total body sodium load.

reduction of fluid overload by intensified dialysis will swiftly lower blood pressure.

low sodium dialysate causes intra-dialytic hypotensive symptoms and is therefore not advisable.




is hard to achieve with monotherapy. Therefore fixed-dose combination therapy should be started as first-line therapy.

is possible in a large number of hemodialysis patients on strict fluid management without antihypertensive drugs.

can be assumed once a patient has normal clinic blood pressure values.

makes screening for end-organ damage unnecessary.




thiazides should always be preferred to loop diuretics due to their longer duration of action.

loop diuretics should always be preferred to thiazides due to their more potent diuretic action.

diuretics can be dosed sparingly in CKD due to greater sensitivity of the nephrons.

2
 body surface area, thiazides should be preferred to loop diuretics.

diuretics have additional antihypertensive efficacy if hypertension is still uncontrolled by renin–angiotensin system blockade.




retard progression of CKD only because they lower blood pressure.

retard progression of CKD only because they reduce proteinuria.

should not be used in proteinuric patients who already receive angiotensin receptor blockers.

may cause hyperkalemia, increased serum creatinine, hypotension and cough but are generally well tolerated.

should not be used in patients with polyuria, as they are mild diuretics.




renal hypertension is usually so pronounced that pharmacological treatment is needed, and burdening patients with therapeutic life-style changes is therefore unnecessary.

low salt diet is not necessary in obese children.

there are no studies to show that weight loss, healthy diet, increased exercise or cessation of (passive) smoking are helpful in children with CKD.




erythropoietin (EPO)-induced hypertension is mainly due to the increase in hematocrit.

calcium channel blockers may be a specific therapy for EPO-induced hypertension.

beta blockers may be a specific therapy for EPO-induced hypertension.

growth hormone causes salt and water retention with clinically relevant hypertension in children with ESRD.

cyclosporine A causes hypertension via constriction of the efferent glomerular arteriole.




the 95th age- and height-dependent percentile in all children with CKD.

the 50th percentile in children with CKD stage 4 and above.

independent of co-morbid diseases.

still being debated but at least the 90th percentile in children with end-organ damage or CKD.
