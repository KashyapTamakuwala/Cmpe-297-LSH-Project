Introduction
Flavoprotein oxidases catalyze the oxidation of a wide range of compounds, while at the same time they reduce oxygen to hydrogen peroxide. They are valuable biocatalysts for the oxidative activation of biomolecules, as they usually selectively oxidize their substrate at a specific position, leaving other positions unaffected. Due to their ability to use molecular oxygen as electron acceptor, no expensive coenzymes like NAD(P)H are needed. This makes oxidases inexpensive and rather straightforward in usage compared to other redox enzymes.

Positives were picked and cultivated overnight in 5 ml liquid LB medium and subjected to another screening cycle to assure that color formation was caused by single clones.

The pH optimum for putrescine oxidase was determined by measuring the activity at different pH values at 25°C. The following buffers were used: 50 mM Pipes buffer (pH 6.4–7.2), 50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.4–8.8), and 50 mM Ches buffer (pH 8.7–9.6). The enzyme activity was measured using the HRP-AAP/DCHBS assay.

 all oxygen was removed by flushing with argon and an absorbance spectrum was recorded from 650 to 300 nm. After adding 50 μM putrescine, another spectrum was recorded for the reduced enzyme. Reoxidation was monitored by collecting spectra in time after the cuvet was exposed to air. A spectrum of the unfolded enzyme was recorded by adding 0.1% SDS and heating for 5 min at 80°C.
