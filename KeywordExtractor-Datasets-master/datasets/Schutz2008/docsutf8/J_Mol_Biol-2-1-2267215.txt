Abstract
Activation of the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) by neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) is essential for NCAM-mediated neurite outgrowth. Previous peptide studies have identified two regions in the fibronectin type 3 (FN3)-like domains of NCAM as being important for these activities. Here we report the crystal structure of the NCAM FN3 domain tandem, which reveals an acutely bent domain arrangement. Mutation of a non-conserved surface residue (M610R) led to a second crystal form showing a substantially different conformation. Thus, the FN3 domain linker is highly flexible, suggesting that it corresponds to the hinge seen in electron micrographs of NCAM. The two putative FGFR1-binding segments, one in each NCAM FN3 domain, are situated close to the domain interface. They form a contiguous patch in the more severely bent conformation but become separated upon straightening of the FN3 tandem, suggesting that conformational changes within NCAM may modulate FGFR1 activation. Surface plasmon resonance experiments demonstrated only a very weak interaction between the NCAM FN3 tandem and soluble FGFR1 proteins expressed in mammalian cells (dissociation constant > 100 μM). Thus, the NCAM–FGFR1 interaction at the cell surface is likely to depend upon avidity effects due to receptor clustering.

FN3 with two FGFR1 ectodomain constructs. We conclude that the NCAM–FGFR1 interaction at the cell surface may be transient or stabilised by avidity effects resulting from receptor clustering and that conformational changes within NCAM may have a profound role in FGFR1 activation.

 The neuroglian tandem, which has an extensive domain interface that incorporates a bound sodium ion, adopts a conformation that is intermediate between the two conformations we report for the NCAM tandem. Thus, a similar bend in the FN3 linker(s) may be a general feature of other animal CAMs containing FN3 domains in their membrane-proximal region.

 and 3 mM KCl), and eluted with 500 mM imidazole in PBS. The eluate was concentrated using Vivaspin centrifugal devices (Sartorius AG) and further purified on a 24-ml Superdex 200 size-exclusion chromatography column (GE Healthcare) with Tris-buffered saline (TBS) buffer, pH 7.4, as the running buffer. Purified proteins were analysed by SDS-PAGE, quantified by measuring their absorption at 280 nm, concentrated to the final desired concentrations and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen for storage at − 80 °C. Final yields were 10–20 mg of pure protein per litre of cell culture medium.

The proteins to be immobilised (50–100 μg/ml in 10 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.5–5.5) were allowed to pass over activated flow cells to reach ∼ 2000–8000 RU, after which unreacted groups were blocked with 20 μl of 1 M ethanolamine, pH 8.5. Reference flow cells without protein were treated identically. The chips were equilibrated in 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 50 μM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and 0.005% surfactant P20 (HBS-EP buffer), and serial dilutions of analyte proteins in PBS (our recombinant proteins or FGF1 from PeproTech) were injected at 20 μl/min for 300 s, followed by 200 s of pure buffer to monitor dissociation. Chips were regenerated using HBS-EP with 1 M glycine–HCl, pH 3.5. The sensorgrams were analysed with the BiaEvaluation 4.1 software.

Schematic drawing of NCAM and FGFR at the cell surface. The cell membrane is represented by a thick horizontal line. Ig and FN3 domains are represented by ovals and rectangles, respectively. The cytosolic tyrosine kinase domain of FGFR is represented by a hexagon; the acid box (AB; see the text) is represented by a filled black rectangle. The arrow indicates the interaction of two NCAM regions (FRM and FGL; see the text) with FGFR.

FN3 and (b) its M610R mutant. The FRM and FGL sequences (see the text) are shown in red and yellow, respectively.



Fig. 5
SDS-PAGE analysis of recombinant NCAM and FGFR1 proteins. Coomassie blue-stained gel of His-tagged soluble proteins expressed in 293-EBNA cells. The positions of molecular mass standards (in kilodaltons) are indicated on the left. The FGFR1 proteins are modified by extensive glycosylation; the NCAM proteins are not glycosylated.
