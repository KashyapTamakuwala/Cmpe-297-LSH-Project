Magnetic induction tomography (MIT) is a low-resolution imaging modality for reconstructing the changes of the complex conductivity in an object. MIT is based on determining the perturbation of an alternating magnetic field, which is coupled from several excitation coils to the object. The conductivity distribution is reconstructed from the corresponding voltage changes induced in several receiver coils. Potential medical applications comprise the continuous, non-invasive monitoring of tissue alterations which are reflected in the change of the conductivity, e.g. edema, ventilation disorders, wound healing and ischemic processes. MIT requires the solution of an ill-posed inverse eddy current problem. A linearized version of this problem was solved for 16 excitation coils and 32 receiver coils with a model of two spherical perturbations within a cylindrical phantom. The method was tested with simulated measurement data. Images were reconstructed with a regularized single-step Gauss–Newton approach. Theoretical limits for spatial resolution and contrast/noise ratio were calculated and compared with the empirical results from a Monte-Carlo study. The conductivity perturbations inside a homogeneous cylinder were localized for a SNR between 44 and 64 dB. The results prove the feasibility of difference imaging with MIT and give some quantitative data on the limitations of the method.

 suggest that the basic requirements for the applicability of this kind of back-projection are not fulfilled in realistic anatomical structures, so that a more appropriate inverse approach is necessary. This paper is dedicated to demonstrating the feasibility of the 3-D reconstruction of a spherical perturbation within a cylindrical conducting body by means of a regularized one-step Gauss–Newton reconstructor. The conductivities were chosen in the physiological range of human tissues.

This method provided always stable images independently of the regularization matrix and was considered as a good basis for a fair comparison between the different regularization methods.

It represents a true 3-D-arrangement which delivers theoretically 512 independent measuring combinations, i.e. 512 data points for one image reconstruction.

It is similar to our experimental system which employs 16 excitation sites in one plane and 14 planar gradiometers which are formed by connecting in counter-phase the coils in the upper and in the lower receiver plane.

The calculation of the complete sensitivity matrix required 48 forward solutions according to the Mortarelli-approach.

Theoretical Limits of Resolution and Contrast/Noise Ratio
30
 while no such study exists for MIT. A similarly rigorous discussion for MIT is certainly beyond the scope of this paper. However, a simplified analysis on resolution and CNR was carried out for our linear reconstruction scheme so as to have a certain theoretical basis for interpreting our empirical results.
There is a fundamental limit for the resolution which depends on the amount of available information in the data. This information depends on the number of data points, i.e. the number of possible sensor–detector-combinations and on the degree of independence between these data points. In the case of EIT and MIT the number of independent data points is usually much lower than the number of voxels, so that the system is under-determined. Moreover the different data are correlated to a certain degree, so that the effective rank is comparatively low. In EIT, e.g. 16 electrodes provide 104 independent data points so that the information is no more than 104 ‘effective pixels’. Including some a priori-information in the form of the regularization terms leads to a defined ‘smearing’ of this information over the imaging plane and provides the typical diffuse images known from EIT.

 whereby P is the set of the indices of all voxels inside the true perturbation. This equation clearly shows that the CNR must decrease when the size of the perturbation shrinks. Assuming a small perturbation and an approximately constant PSF inside this region the CNR is approximately inversely proportional to the volume of the perturbation. The detectability limit can then be defined as the one where the CNR equals 1.

In analogy to EIT the PSF depends strongly on the location, showing the broadest distribution in the center of the cylinder. This is reflected by increasing resolution when moving from the center towards the periphery. Increasing the amount of regularization or decreasing the truncation level according to increasing measurement noise the PSF broadens and its center of gravity is shifted towards the borders of the cylinder. Moreover increasingly strong ringing in form of star-like patterns becomes observable close to the border (not shown explicitly in this paper).

Mean and CNR of the pixel values in the center of gravity of each reconstructed perturbation. These parameters quantify the correctness of the reconstructed values as well as their uncertainty. The theoretically expected values are listed for comparison. The center of gravity was chosen as evaluation point because the reconstructed perturbations deviate more or less from the spherical shape and show significant outward shift with increasing noise level.

Radial outward shift of the spheres in the reconstructed image (fidelity of the location). This shift was determined by localizing the center of gravity for each spot within a wedge-shaped search region with a height of 2.6 times the sphere’s radius and excluding the outermost 2 mm as well as the innermost 40 mm in radial direction from the center. The restriction of the search region to this volume prevented spurious contributions from outliers and negative image values far away from the real perturbing regions. Also for this parameter we present theoretical values as expected from the PSF.

,0,0) decreases from 0.02–0.03 S/m to 0.002–0.006 S/m, compared to the true value of 0.1 S/m. This means that even under nearly ideal conditions (64 dB SNR) the conductivity changes are strongly underestimated. NM and TSVD yield nearly the same central voxel values as TSVD while VU produces much lower values.

IM and NM perform nearly identically, also their optimal regularization parameters are almost identical. VU yields, in general, larger values in the perturbed regions but also a larger STD.

Discussion

 in MIT the sensitivity is not concentrated within a field tube between excitation and receiver coil but increases with the distance from the tube axis, according to the increase of the eddy current density. This may be the main reason why the reconstructed solution tends to be displaced towards the nearest border of the cylindrical tank, especially at higher noise levels. An extreme case for this effect can be observed if the perturbation is placed exactly in the origin and if the senders and receivers are all in the same plane (image not shown due to space restrictions). Instead of the expected spot in the origin two widely separated spots appear on the cylinder axis close to the top and bottom of the cylinder, respectively. In fact such a coil arrangement cannot distinguish between an object in the center and two objects on the cylinder axis placed symmetrically with respect to the origin, because it is always possible to find two corresponding conductivitiy changes so that the field perturbations in the median plane are the same. Obviously, in this ambiguous situation, the algorithm favors the splitted solution according to the sensitivity distribution. A similar ambiguity occurs when using differential sensors, such as the gradiometers employed in our setup. For getting rid of such artifacts it is very important to use a less symmetric transceiver setup which provides enough spatial information in 3-D.

 are typical features of the PSF as well as the ‘star-artifact’ in the TSVD-images. Therefore these ringing artifacts do not stem from inaccuracies of the reconstruction method or measurement errors, but, instead, are inherent in the PSF.

 should also show the dependence of the resolution on contrast, size and location of the perturbation at a given noise level. However, such a comprehensive analysis requires a separate paper and should not be given here.

a is that at higher noise levels the CNR-curves cross the curve for 64 dB. This means that very close to the periphery noisier data yield higher CNR values than less noisy data. The reason for this counter-intuitive effect is not yet entirely clear but may be related to the strong outward shift of the PSF at higher noise. In those cases the evaluation of the CNR at the original position of the perturbation may not be appropriate any more and should be interpreted with caution.
In the case of weak perturbation we can assume that the CNR depends approximately linearly on the conductivity difference Δσ. The dependence on the volume of the perturbation is, in general, more complicated because the PSF depends on the location and is therefore not constant throughout the whole perturbation. Only in the case of small spatial extension of the perturbation an approximately linear dependence on the volume can be assumed.
The low number of significant singular values even at comparatively low noise (64 dB SNR) suggests that, similar as in EIT, a significant amount of sensor combinations does not provide enough independent information. Intuitively one would expect this finding because there exist pairs of excitation/receiving coils which nearly fulfill the reciprocity condition and hence reduce the amount of useful combinations to about half of the number of possible combinations, i.e. to 256 in our case.
Further investigations should determine the maximum ‘useful’ number of sensors in one plane, i.e. that number beyond which additional sensors do not increase the resolution significantly. Adding more sensors off-plane may add more 3-D-information and hence still provide improvement. This possibility should be studied in further research.
When comparing the regularization schemes after application of the Morozov-criterion, the IM and the NM approach yield the smoothest visual appearance and the highest CNR. However, they also tend to displace the perturbations towards the border of the tank. The best localization is obtained with VU, probably because the imposed variance counteracts somewhat the lower sensitivity in the center of the object. However, VU yields also the lowest CNR, i.e. the less homogeneous images and more pronounced ghosts. The failure of TSVD at a SNR of 44 dB was not expected theoretically, although, in general, it produces the poorest theoretical resolution. In terms of separability of the two perturbations VU performs best, especially when also taking into account the correct localization.
In neither case, however, the single-step solution provides the correct values for Δσ. Even at a SNR of 64 dB the reconstructed differences are too low by a factor of at least 5, thus demonstrating that the method yields the correct search direction but not the correct step size.
The highest mean voxel values are provided by VU and TSVD, the drop with the noise levels being lowest. However, on the other hand VU yields the highest standard deviations. Moreover VU tends to produce more pronounced ‘ghost objects’ in the homogeneous region than IM and NM. As expected from the PSF TSVD tends to produce ‘star-artifacts’ at the cylinder border, i.e. a periodic pattern with 16 peaks close to the centers of the receiving coils. This artifact gets worse at increasing noise level.
First experiments with smaller models and at least 10 iterations with an iterative solver show that the solution converges towards the correct voxel values. Nevertheless the single-step method may be completely justified in cases where only qualitative changes are sought for or where proportions are to be reconstructed, e.g. in frequency differential spectroscopic imaging. Therefore the area of applicability of a single-step approach has to be analyzed carefully in future work.

 However, our results have only been achieved with two single focal perturbations with a relatively large diameter of 20% of the background object. In a more advanced study the stability and the resolution of the images should be investigated for a series of perturbations with different diameter and spacing. For the monitoring of brain edema which usually do not split up in separate sub-regions our approach may be sufficiently stable. This hypothesis has to be tested both theoretically and empirically for centrally placed perturbations (worst case).
18
28
 an improvement of the SNR by a factor of 5–10 is still technically possible, thus reaching 50–60 dB, which is obviously sufficient for producing fairly acceptable difference images.
Another open question is the influence of the mesh quality on the reconstruction results. We used a comparatively coarse non-uniform grid for the reconstruction. Therefore non-negligible numerical errors are to be expected which may explain the discrepancies between theoretically expected and the reconstructed values for CNR and radial displacement. Also the apparently somewhat worse spatial resolution in the reconstructed images than theoretically expected may be due to such numerical problems. The influence of the mesh and the optimization of mesh quality should be a major issue for further developments.
The results were obtained at a single frequency only. Future work should concentrate on the exploitation of the frequency dependence of the tissue conductivity and measurements at frequencies up to several MHz. A multi-frequency approach is expected to increase significantly the available information and thus the quality of the images. Possible applications may then in fact be the same as for EIT (lung function monitoring, lung edema monitoring) and hydration monitoring in the brain.
