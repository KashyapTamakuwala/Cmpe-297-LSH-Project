Impingement syndromes of the ankle involve either osseous or soft tissue impingement and can be anterior, anterolateral, or posterior. Ankle impingement syndromes are painful conditions caused by the friction of joint tissues, which are both the cause and the effect of altered joint biomechanics. The distal fascicle of the anterior inferior tibiofibular ligament (AITFL) is possible cause of anterior impingement. The objective of this article was to review the literature concerning the anatomy, pathogenesis, symptoms and treatment of the AITFL impingement and finally to formulate treatment recommendations. The AITFL starts from the distal tibia, 5 mm in average above the articular surface, and descends obliquely between the adjacent margins of the tibia and fibula, anterior to the syndesmosis to the anterior aspect of the lateral malleolus. The incidence of the accessory fascicle differs very widely in the several studies. The presence of the distal fascicle of the AITFL and also the contact with the anterolateral talus is probably a normal finding. It may become pathological, due to anatomical variations and/or anterolateral instability of the ankle resulting from an anterior talofibular ligament injury. When observed during an ankle arthroscopy, the surgeon should look for the criteria described to decide whether it is pathological and considering resection of the distal fascicle. The presence of the AITFL and the contact with the talus is a normal finding. An impingement of the AITFL can result from an anatomical variant or anteroposterior instability of the ankle. The diagnosis of ligamentous impingement in the anterior aspect of the ankle should be considered in patients who have chronic ankle pain in the anterolateral aspect of the ankle after an inversion injury and have a stable ankle, normal plain radiographs, and isolated point tenderness on the anterolateral aspect of the talar dome and in the anteroinferior tibiofibular ligament. The impingement syndrome can be treated arthroscopically.

] founded in 10 of the 46 specimens an accessory ligament. This ligament was parallel and distal to the AITFL. The fibres of the accessory ligament descended obliquely from the lateral, anterior, and distal borders of the tibia to the anteromedial aspect of the lateral malleolus, approximating the fibular insertion of the anterior talofibular ligament (ATFL).

Type 1
Multiple fascicles (more than three) with or without small gaps between adjacent fascicles

  1A
The inferior fascicle is separated from the rest of the ligament by a gap and possesses its own distinct proximal and distal attachments

  1B
The inferior fascicle is not completely separated from the rest of the ligament by a gap. Either its proximal or its distal attachment is continuous with the rest of the ligament

  1C
Multiple fascicles without gaps intervening between them

Type 2
Three fascicles or less. A distinct inferior fascicle with both its proximal and distal attachments separate from the rest of the ligament. The inferior fascicle is separated completely from the main portion of the ligament by a gap

Type 3
Three fascicles or less. A distinct inferior fascicle with either its proximal or its distal attachment continuous with the rest of the ligament. A gap does not completely separate the inferior fascicle from the rest of the ligament

Type 4
Three fascicles or less. The lower portion of the ligament possesses an inferior fascicle with both its proximal and distal attachments for the rest of the ligament

Type 5
Three fascicles or less. A ligament with no separations or gaps within its structure. It may or may not possess a fascicular arrangement






Pathomechanism of the impingement syndrome

It should be stressed that most studies were carried out in vitro and do not take muscular tonus and the effects of weightbearing into consideration, we performed a review of the pathomechanism of the impingement syndrome caused by the distal fascicle of the AITFL.

]. Mean width and length of the fascicle with bending during dorsiflexion and dorsiflexion-eversion were significantly higher than the fascicle without bending. Therefore this wider and longer fascicles had more potential to become pathological than thinner ones. They also conclude that if the fibular insertion point is far from the joint level, the fascicle has more potential to become pathological. These findings might be useful during arthroscopic procedures of the ankle.

On base of these studies we conclude that anterolateral hyperlaxity results in anterior extrusion of the talar dome with dorsiflexion, which contacts the inferior fascicle of the AITFL with more pressure and friction. This hyperlaxity was most likely due to an injured ATFL. Wider and longer fascicles and a fibular insertion point far from the joint level have more potential to become pathological. Often contact between the AITFL and the superolateral corner of the talus and an abraded region of the cartilage of the talus can be observed during arthroscopy.

] arthroscopically resected the distal fascicle of the AITFL in 21 patients with chronic ankle pain after an ankle sprain. During the procedure an impinging distal fascicle of the AITFL was found in all cases. Following anterolateral synovectomie, the fascicle was excised. At an average follow-up of 3 years good to excellent results were obtained in 17 patients. Nineteen patients were satisfied with the procedure and 17 patients returned to previous level of activity. Two patients who had mild laxity were graded as poor because neuromas of the terminal branches of the superficial peroneal nerve. These patients became asymptomatic after an injection of steroids.

] treated seven patients who had talar impingement by an AITFL and they were followed for a mean of 39 months. Two patients had arthroscopy and five had an arthrotomy. In all patients, a thickened distal fascicle of the AITFL was resected. Five patients also needed debridement of an area of abraded hyaline cartilage on the anterolateral aspect of the talar dome at the point where the distal fascicle made contact. Post-operative management consisted of 2–4 days of immobilisation, followed by progressive weightbearing. Four patients reported no pain in their ankle or limitation in activity, and the results were considered to be excellent. Two patients reported improvement, with only occasional pain related to overuse, and the result was considered good. The last patient had been followed for only 6 months with excellent results.

] treated nine athletes with anterolateral ankle pain during and following athletic activities without history of ankle injury. After 3 months conservative management each patient was explored arthroscopically. Patients’ outcomes were rated subjectively and objectively based on the UCLA ankle scoring system. Pathological characteristics were easily identifiable through arthroscopy. The structure may be resected during this procedure without sacrificing the stability of the ankle joint. They report that good to excellent results can be expected from this procedure including in the highest level of athleticism at an average follow-up of 18 months.
The decision to perform an arthroscopy of the ankle is typically based on the patient’s history and physical examination. When an impinging distal fascicle of the AITFL and an abraded anterolateral region of the talus were observed during an ankle arthroscopy, the surgeon should look for the criteria described above to decide whether it is pathological and needs to be resected.

Conclusion

Because of the lack of evidence only preliminary conclusions can be drawn. The AITFL started from the distal tibia, 5 mm in average above the articular surface, and descended obliquely between the adjacent margins of the tibia and fibula, anterior to the syndesmosis to the anterior aspect of the lateral malleolus. The incidence of the accessory fascicle differs very widely in the several studies. The presence of the distal fascicle of the AITFL and also the contact with the anterolateral talus is probably a normal finding. It may become pathological, however, due to anatomical variations and/or anterolateral instability of the ankle resulting from an ATFL injury. When observed during an ankle arthroscopy, the surgeon should look for the criteria described to decide whether it is pathological and considering resection of the distal fascicle.
