Musculoskeletal disorders often have associated pain, functional impairment and work disability, and, not surprisingly, are the most common reasons for utilizing healthcare resources. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and fibromyalgia (FM) are causes of musculoskeletal pain and disability. Research indicates that there is a widespread impact of RA and FM on physical, psychological and social factors in affected individuals, and thus, outcome measures that encompass multiple aspects of quality of life are needed. Generic measures of quality of life identify associations between physical conditions and mental health and highlight the need to address psychological functioning to ultimately improve the individuals’ quality of life.

]. Measures such as the SF-36 provide the building blocks to create models of quality of life and study the different perspectives of this process across a range of chronic physical conditions as well as healthy individuals. Within this framework, using generic measures of quality of life can offer opportunities to frame research and interventions that appropriately target the quality of life of individuals with musculoskeletal disorders.

]. Measures such as the SF-36 clearly identify the associations between chronic physical conditions and mental health and further highlight the importance of addressing psychological functioning in both research and interventions to ultimately improve the individuals’ quality of life.
RA and FM are of course not mutually exclusive. The pathophysiology of each disorder is different, and many patients with RA also have FM, as do many other patients with a variety of chronic rheumatic diseases. The substrate of FM lies in the pain system, which can be functionally activated by distress, a common feature of chronic painful and disabling disorders. How much of the FM mechanism contributes to the low quality of life of RA? Further exploration of the mechanisms causing FM, with its resultant highly significant effect on the quality of life, will have a great impact on the management of not only FM itself but also RA and related musculoskeletal conditions.
