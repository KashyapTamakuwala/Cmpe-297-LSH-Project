 < 0.01). With six out of ten items, the JAFAS classified the child as less disabled than with corresponding CHAQ activities. Overall, associations with measures of disease activity and ROM were higher for the CHAQ than for the JAFAS. A performance test (JAFAS) does not appear to have an added benefit over the questionnaire-based assessment (CHAQ) of physical function in a cross-sectional study.

]. As minor average disability in patients with JIA is nowadays a reality, identifying those tasks that can discriminate among lower levels of disability becomes all the more important. In addition, as performance tests are time consuming and require specific equipment and trained assessors, it is relevant to know whether they have an added benefit over a questionnaire-based instrument.
The aim of the present study was therefore to compare the measurement properties of the JAFAS and the CHAQ in an unselected population of children with JIA on the level of individual items.

] and no other medical conditions interfering with functional ability. The patients were visiting the outpatient paediatric rheumatology clinic of the Leiden University Medical Centre. The clinic, which has two part-time working paediatric rheumatologists, is a tertiary referral centre for children with rheumatic diseases from the Leiden district and surrounding area (1 million inhabitants). The Medical Ethics Committee approved the study, and all patients and their parents gave written informed consent.

Assessment methods
The JAFAS (range 0–20) was developed as an objective measure of functional ability in children with rheumatic diseases between 7 and 18 years. With the JAFAS, the observed time needed to perform ten activities is compared with a standard ‘criterion’ time. The JAFAS was administered by one well-trained paediatric physical therapist (Bekkering).
The CHAQ, including 30 activities in eight different domains, with a total score ranging from 0 (no limitation) to 3 (maximal limitation), was completed by interviewing the children.

Results
Characteristics of the patients
From the 33 eligible children who visited the outpatient paediatric rheumatology clinic in the study period, two children refused to participate, and three did not fulfil the inclusion criteria (two children had serious mental retardation and one child had the attention deficit hyperactivity disorder). Thus, 28 children, 12 boys and 16 girls, were included. Their median age was 10.0 years (range 7.3–12.8), and the median disease duration was 3.3 years (range 0.1–10.2). A majority of the children had a polyarticular (nine patients) or oligoarticular pattern (11 patients) of joint involvement. Systemic onset JIA (three patients), arthritis and psoriasis (four patients) and enthesitis type JIA (one patient) were less frequently seen. Twenty (71%) children used anti-rheumatic medication, of whom 17 (68%) used disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs and three (11%) used oral corticosteroids.
The median scores of the ESR (7.7 mm/h, range 2–54), the JC-swollen (1.0, range 0–28), the JC-tender (0.8, range 0–8), the VAS-well-being (0.2, range 0–2.5), VAS-pain (0.1, range 0–1.5) and VAS-paediatrician (0.2, range 0–2.7) point at a relatively low level of disease activity. With respect to joint ROM, the median JC-limitation score was 1.0 (range 0–17), and the median EPM-ROM score was 0. 5 (range 0–19.5).

].
The children’s version of the CHAQ was originally designed and validated with the questionnaire self-administrated by the patients. In this study, the questions were read out and filled in by the investigator to ensure appropriate completion. Although it is likely that with this method, the same results are obtained as with self-administration, a possible influence on the final scoring cannot be totally ruled out.

]. Which items should be included has to be further examined, as the nine CHAQ items this study focusses on are only selected because they corresponded with the JAFAS. With any future research, the conduction of large, prospective follow-up studies is to be advised.
