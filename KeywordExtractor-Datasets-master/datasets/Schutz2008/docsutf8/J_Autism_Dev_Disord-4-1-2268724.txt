Children with PDD-NOS demonstrated a more attention-demanding strategy of face processing, and processed neutral faces more similarly to complex patterns whereas children with MCDD showed an advantage for face recognition compared to complex patterns. Results further suggested that any disadvantage in face recognition was related more to the autistic features of the PDD-NOS group rather than characteristics specific to MCDD. No significant group differences emerged for identifying facial expressions.

). This study aims to directly compare children with MCDD to those with PDD-NOS on two measures of social cognition: face recognition and identification of facial expressions. Both of these skills are important to examine given the difficulties in social functioning reported in children with MCDD. Such studies are valuable since any emerging differences in social-cognitive functioning between these two groups of children would further support the validity of MCDD as a separate diagnostic construct. Further validation of the concept of MCDD would emphasize the importance of investigating etiology and efficacy of treatments for MCDD separately from PDD-NOS.

). Although children with MCDD may demonstrate similar core social deficits as seen in children with PDD-NOS, parallels between the symptoms and biological reactivity in children with MCDD, and adults with schizophrenia spectrum disorders, suggest that a different pattern of performance on social cognitive tasks might emerge compared to children with PDD-NOS. We aimed to examine whether children with MCDD could be differentiated from children with PDD-NOS on two important aspects of social cognition: face recognition and the identification of facial expressions.

Aims and Predictions of the Study

). Considering MCDD as qualitatively distinct from PDD-NOS has implications for treatment. Viewing MCDD as a subgroup of PDD-NOS may focus treatment on the improvement of social skills, whereas if the emphasis in MCDD was on the thought disorder and its relation to psychotic development as well as on anxiety symptoms, a more medication-focused approach might be preferred. However, if social cognitive skills were quite the same, such a finding could also suggest that the diagnostic boundaries of the DSM-categories are weak: people with schizoid/psychotic symptoms might have a neurobiological condition different from that of people with only PDD-symptoms though sharing important PDD core features. Such a finding would stress the necessity for profiling patients along various dimensions including their psychophysiological responsiveness and (social) cognitive capacities.
We predicted that children with MCDD would differ from those with PDD-NOS on recognizing neutral faces in comparison to complex patterns. More specifically, if indeed children with MCDD are not well-placed under the PDD’s, we would expect them to be faster and more accurate on face recognition compared to children with PDD-NOS, but perform similarly on especially complex pattern recognition.

Children with MCDD would show differences in the identification of facial expressions, particularly a bias toward processing fear and anger expressions, as compared to children with PDD-NOS. Any significant differences found should not be explained by differences in mental age.





Methods
Participants
The study sample was selected from 503 children, aged 6–12 years old, who were consecutively referred to the outpatient department of child and adolescent psychiatry, between July 2002 and September 2004. Referrals were comprised of a large variety of child psychiatric disorders (externalizing disorders, internalizing disorders, PDDs). Research criteria for MCDD and PDD-NOS were rated incompletely for 12 (2.4%) children, who were excluded from further analyses. Complete MCDD and PDD-NOS criteria were rated for 491 children.
Twenty-nine (5.9%) children met research criteria for a diagnosis of MCDD. Eleven children (44%) meeting MCDD research criteria also met research criteria for PDD-NOS. These children were placed in the MCDD group. The parents of four of these children refused to participate in the study. Seventy-nine children met research criteria for a diagnosis of PDD-NOS without meeting research criteria for MCDD (PDD-NOS group). These children did not meet DSM-IV criteria for autism or Asperger syndrome. Children with an IQ score of less than 70 were not administered the neuropsychological battery; two children in the MCDD group, and 13 children in the PDD-NOS group were not administered the neuropsychological tasks on this basis. A further two children meeting MCDD criteria had missing data for the face recognition (FR) task and identification of facial expressions task (IFE). Thus, the MCDD group included a total of 21 children. In addition to the children without neuropsychological data due to a low IQ, five children in the PDD-NOS group were missing data for the FR task, and four were missing data for the IFE task, resulting in a total of 61 PDD-NOS children with FR task data, and 62 children with IFE task data.

Ethics
Participation was voluntary, and informed consent was signed by all parents/caretakers prior to participation in the study. Children who were 12 years old also signed the consent forms themselves. The Medical Ethics Committee of the Erasmus Medical Center approved the study.

An interrater reliability study was conducted for 30 randomly selected children (27%). Two clinicians independently rated all MCDD and PDD-NOS research criteria. Agreement between the raters on the presence or absence of a PDD-NOS diagnosis was good (κ = .62). Agreement for MCDD diagnosis could not be calculated, as MCDD did not occur once in this subsample.

Materials
Procedure
Children were assessed on two occasions, separated by a week. Testing was conducted in a quiet room in the outpatient department of the hospital. On the first occasion, the full Weschsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC-R) was administered, taking on average, 2 h per child. The social-cognitive tasks were administered on the second visit the following week as part of a larger neuropsychological battery taking approximately one and a half hours. Children were always tested in the morning to minimize the effects of fatigue and to maximize concentration.

As with the FR task, there were 20 trials for the target condition and 20 trials for the non-target condition, each for the easy condition and the complex condition. Easy and complex patterns as target and non-target trials were presented in a random manner.

Examples of different expressions in the Identification of Facial Expressions (IFE) task. Children are presented with four different tasks (each corresponding to one of four target emotions: happy, sad, anger, and fear). For each task, children are required to focus on a particular emotion, and to judge whether the face displays a specific target emotion. The target consists of an adult face expressing one of four emotions. When the face matches the emotion a ‘yes’ response is required, when the face does not match the emotion, a ‘no’ response is required. A total of 40 trials per emotion condition were presented, with half of those trials requiring a ‘yes’ response (target), and half requiring a ‘no’ response (nontarget). RT and accuracy (i.e. proportion correct) for target and non-target conditions were calculated

To test our hypothesis, two types of repeated measures analyses were conducted, each on our measures of accuracy and speed of processing separately. In the first type we compared the easy condition of the PR task with the performance of the FR task, in the second type we compared the complex condition of the PR with the FR task. Each analysis included two within-subjects variables: (1) “task” (FR versus PR) and (2) “response type” (target versus non-target). The between-subjects variable was group. Significant group by task interactions would indicate that the groups differ in their manner of processing neutral faces as compared to abstract patterns.

Our first hypothesis was therefore partially supported: children with PDD-NOS were less accurate than children with MCDD in recognizing that a neutral face was present in the response set, but this effect was not seen when they were asked to note whether an abstract pattern was present amongst similar ones (i.e. complex condition). There was, however, no group difference in task dependent RTs.

), using data from the same participants as in the present study, reported that children in the MCDD group (36.0%) fulfilled criteria for ADOS-G classifications of autism or autism spectrum to a lesser extent compared to children in the PDD-NOS group (62.2%). Hence, the more time-consuming and therefore attention-demanding strategy of face processing described by Serra and colleagues and seen in our group of children with PDD-NOS could be due to the more ‘autistic’ characteristics of our PDD-NOS group. Face recognition appeared to be less attention-demanding in our MCDD group that did not meet the diagnostic criteria for a PDD-NOS. Our results therefore suggest that MCDD symptoms are associated with disadvantages in especially the speed of recognizing unfamiliar faces only to the extent to which they are accompanied by social problems severe enough to meet the diagnostic criteria for PDD-NOS.

) do not translate to a more basic level of emotion recognition. Differences between the two groups in the production and regulation of affective states are nevertheless quite likely, since especially children with MCDD appear to have substantial difficulties regulating their affective state. Future work should incorporate tasks that allow for the examination of each of the three of the above-mentioned components of emotion-processing. In order to provoke changes in affective state such a task should take into account real-life situations or experiences that may trigger strong emotional reactions in these children. Such a task might help to extract further information on how the symptoms associated with MCDD may or may not discriminate emotion-processing ability from those with PDD-NOS.

) directly compared children with MCDD to PDD-NOS, and reported differences in symptom profiles using similar-sized groups while standard deviations in the dependent measures relative to their means (i.e. the variance coefficients) were greater in that study than those of, for example, the reaction times in our study. This suggests that the hypothesized group differences could have been smaller in order to be detected as significant. We are therefore not inclined to interpret the few significant differences in our study as being due to a power problem. We cannot exclude the possibility that children with MCDD and PDD-NOS use different cognitive strategies to achieve the same end level of performance. The use of neuro-imaging technologies and ERP studies would help to rule out this possibility, and may yield greater insight into the mechanisms underlying social cognition in these children.

Conclusion
Despite the existence of thought disorder in children with MCDD, the symptom level differences between PDD-NOS and MCDD children, and the biological/psychophysiological differences between MCDD children and other comparison groups, we found little evidence that children with MCDD are clearly distinguishable from those with PDD-NOS on the identification of facial expressions. Surprisingly, the high rates of anxieties and fears clinically characteristic of children with MCDD did not translate to any significant effects on our emotion-processing task. Further work is needed to probe whether more subtle emotion-processing differences exist. Such studies should focus on examining children’s processing of emotional stimuli within a context more relevant to ‘real-life’ as well as detailed evaluation of children’s emotion regulation ability.
The only significant difference to emerge was that children with MCDD not meeting the criteria for a PDD diagnosis demonstrated fewer errors and a faster processing of unfamiliar neutral faces compared to children with PDD-NOS who processed faces more similarly to how they processed complex patterns. This suggests a disadvantage in face processing being related to the autistic characteristics of the PDD-NOS. Based on these findings, it is recommended that the impact of autistic features (amount and severity) are carefully considered when evaluating a child with MCDD symptoms since such features may yield relevant information about the child’s social cognitive abilities. Ideally, future work should include prospective designs which follow up children with MCDD who do and do not demonstrate autistic characteristics.
