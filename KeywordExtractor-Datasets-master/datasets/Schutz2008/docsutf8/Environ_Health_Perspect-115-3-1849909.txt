Objective
Isocyanates (di- and poly-), important chemicals used worldwide to produce polyurethane products, are a leading cause of occupational asthma. Respiratory exposures have been reduced through improved hygiene controls and the use of less-volatile isocyanates. Yet isocyanate asthma continues to occur, not uncommonly in settings with minimal inhalation exposure but opportunity for skin exposure. In this review we evaluate the potential role of skin exposure in the development of isocyanate asthma.

Data sources
We reviewed the published animal and human literature on isocyanate skin-exposure methods, workplace skin exposure, skin absorption, and the role of skin exposure in isocyanate sensitization and asthma.

Data extraction
We selected relevant articles from computerized searches on Medline, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Occupational Safety and Health Administration, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, and Google databases using the keywords “isocyanate,” “asthma,” “skin,” “sensitization,” and other synonymous terms, and our own extensive collection of isocyanate publications.

Data synthesis
Isocyanate production and use continues to increase as the polyurethane industry expands. There is substantial opportunity for isocyanate skin exposure in many work settings, but such exposure is challenging to quantify and continues to be underappreciated. Isocyanate skin exposure can occur at work, even with the use of personal protective equipment, and may also occur with consumer use of certain isocyanate products. In animals, isocyanate skin exposure is an efficient route to induce sensitization, with subsequent inhalation challenge resulting in asthma-like responses. Several lines of evidence support a similar role for human isocyanate skin exposure, namely, that such exposure occurs and can contribute to the development of isocyanate asthma in certain settings, presumably by inducing systemic sensitization.

Conclusions
Integrated animal and human research is needed to better understand the role of skin exposure in human isocyanate asthma and to improve diagnosis and prevention. In spite of substantial research needs, sufficient evidence already exists to justify greater emphasis on the potential risks of isocyanate skin exposure and the importance of preventing such exposures at work and during consumer use of certain isocyanate products.

Isocyanates, a group of reactive chemicals [with the functional group N = C = O (NCO)] used extensively in the production of numerous polyurethane foams, coatings, and a wide array of consumer products, are a major cause of occupational asthma worldwide. The polyurethane industry has expanded dramatically, along with the number of workers and consumers at risk for exposure. Inhalation has long been considered the primary route of isocyanate exposure, induction of sensitization, and asthma; research, practice, and regulation have focused almost exclusively on understanding and preventing inhalation exposures. Airborne isocyanate exposures have been reduced through improved controls and use of less-volatile isocyanates. Yet isocyanate asthma continues to occur, not uncommonly in work settings where measured isocyanate respiratory exposures are very low or nondetectable, but where there is opportunity for skin exposure.
Karol et al. (1981)
Nicholson et al. 2005

). Over the past several years there has been a growing, but largely unrecognized, collection of animal, industrial hygiene, clinical, and epidemiologic data related to isocyanate skin exposure and its role in the development of isocyanate sensitization and asthma. Our primary purpose in this article is to review and synthesize this multi-disciplinary literature to address several key unresolved issues, including the extent of isocyanate skin exposures in the workplace, the effectiveness of personal protective equipment, and most importantly, whether human skin exposure contributes to the development of isocyanate asthma. The findings may be relevant to the larger issue of the role of skin as an important underrecognized site of exposure and sensitization for other environmental allergens.

Bello et al. 2004

). Skin or respiratory sensitization typically refers to the route of exposure that results in systemic sensitization, rather than localized immune responses at those sites.

Literature search
We have been active in the field of isocyanate research and have collected > 800 published and unpublished articles and documents from 1951 to the present; these articles and documents are related to isocyanates and span many disciplines. In addition, we performed computerized searches of the literature on Medline [1966 to the present (National Library of Medicine, Bethesda, MD)], National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) databases and Google (google.com) using the key words “isocyanate,” “diisocyanate,” “asthma,” “sensitization,” “exposure,” “dermal,” “skin,” “occupational,” “methylene diphenyl diisocyanate,” and other synonymous terms. Additional articles were identified from the reference lists of the selected relevant articles. We reviewed primarily English-language articles, as well as selected articles in German, Danish, and French. Human and animal articles that addressed isocyanate skin exposure, sensitization, and health effects were retained for further analysis. We also included clinical, epidemiologic, and biomarker studies and case reports that mentioned skin as a potential route of exposure or had low isocyanate air levels based on exposure data or work processes.

) is undoubtedly higher today, given industry growth and new applications. Most commercial isocyanate products are complex isocyanate mixtures of variable molecular mass, volatility, and isocyanate content. Workplace exposures can occur in the form of isocyanate vapors, aerosols, or both, depending on the isocyanate type as well as the application method and other factors. Isocyanates are commonly mixed with various solvents, polyols, and other substances, such as catalysts and blowing agents, which may affect isocyanate reactivity, skin absorption, and health effects.

Measuring isocyanate skin exposure
Quantification of isocyanate skin exposure is important for research, prevention, and control. Assessment of skin exposure, in general, is much less developed than that of inhalation exposure. Skin exposure sampling methods typically are nonstandardized, have undergone limited validation, and can be technically challenging. Isocyanate skin sampling is further complicated by several factors, including the reactivity of NCO groups toward skin proteins, water, or other compounds, and the complexity of most isocyanate exposures. Biomarkers such as urinary metabolites, if available, could potentially be used to assess internal dose, but would not distinguish between skin and respiratory exposure.

 recently evaluated several different TDI sensitization scenarios (inhalation, subcutaneous, topical) and challenge protocols (vapor, tracheal instillation) in mice. Topical sensitization followed by tracheal instillation of TDI most closely reproduced the Th2-type lung inflammatory response seen in human asthma, whereas sensitization with vapor TDI was not effective.

Herrick et al. 2002
Karol et al. 1981
Vanoirbeek et al. 2004
). Although issues of comparability with humans are inevitable, such as differences in skin permeability, much can be learned from animal models regarding exposure–response relationships and the mechanisms that lead to skin sensitization and asthma.

Human studies
Mapp et al. 2005
Wisnewski et al. 2006
Liss et al. 1988
Welinder et al. 1988
Wisnewski et al. 2006
). Isocyanates are considered a potent respiratory sensitizer in humans, based largely on circumstantial evidence rather than on clear demonstration that respiratory exposure alone (without associated skin exposure) leads to isocyanate asthma.
Donnelly et al. 2004
Legris et al. 1995
Sommer et al. 2000
Valks et al. 2003
). Consistent across these case reports is the development of MDI asthma in settings where skin exposure to MDI occurred and where MDI air levels, if measured, were non-detectable or extremely low and opportunity for MDI respiratory exposure was very limited. These cases strongly suggest that skin exposure was the predominant exposure route and contributed to the development of isocyanate sensitization and asthma. They also demonstrate that isocyanate asthma can occur in settings where measured isocyanate respiratory exposures are below the level of detection, even when sensitive analytical methods are used.
Petsonk et al. (2000)
 investigated a group of new workers exposed to MDI resins in a facility designed for minimal airborne exposures and noted new asthma-like respiratory symptoms in 27% of the workers with the highest potential for MDI exposure. These symptoms were associated with liquid MDI skin exposure, as evaluated by worker questionnaires and workplace observations.
Leanerts-Langanke (1992)
 described an investigation of about 500 coal mine workers who used MDI for rock consolidation. Quantitative air sampling results were at or below the detection limit (1 ppb). MDI skin exposure was reported in about half the workers; MDI-IgE was detected in several workers; and 2 were diagnosed with isocyanate asthma based on a positive specific challenge. Elevated levels of MDI metabolites in urine were found in 6 of 8 workers seen after “massive skin contamination.” The authors concluded that skin could be an important route of exposure, leading to sensitization and asthma.
Bernstein et al. (1993)
 studied a cohort of 243 workers in a urethane molding plant that consistently maintained low MDI airborne exposures (< 5 ppb). Isocyanate asthma and/or sensitization (MDI-IgE) was diagnosed in several workers, most of whom were reported likely to have had MDI skin exposure.

), have been considered important contributing factors in such cases. Typically, such exposures are unpredictable and frequently accidental, making them difficult to investigate and quantify.
Basketter et al. 2006

). There are insufficient data to address isocyanate skin exposure–response relationships in humans; however, as noted above, in animal models relatively small skin doses can induce sensitization, and dose–response relationships may be variable.

Bakke et al. 2006

). Wider dissemination and improved hazard communication of this information by occupational and environmental health professionals, as well as better personal protection among workers, are needed. Inclusion of “skin” notation may encourage such protection for all isocyanates (diisocyanates and polyisocyanates).

Research needs
In this review we highlight several important areas for further research regarding isocyanate skin exposure, ideally using multidisciplinary approaches involving animal models and clinical and epidemiologic investigations. Such approaches should lead to a better understanding of the mechanistic pathways that result in isocyanate asthma and the role of skin exposure in this process. A key research need not unique to issues regarding skin exposure is the development of a good marker of isocyanate sensitization or “pre-clinical” asthma that correlates well with the subsequent development of asthma. Such a marker would greatly enhance isocyanate research, including elucidation of exposure–response relationships, and facilitate diagnosis and prevention.
There is a need to better assess isocyanate skin exposures in the workplace and other environments and to incorporate these exposure data into epidemiologic and clinical studies. The typically more sporadic nature of such exposures further complicates real-world exposure assessment and requires algorithms that employ a combination of daily activities (diaries), questionnaires, and task-based exposure data. Development of route-specific bio-markers, such as those specific for skin or lung, would greatly facilitate isocyanate exposure assessment. Skin exposure methodologies and biomarkers of exposure can be further developed and validated using integrated animal models.
Numerous host and environmental determinants of isocyanate skin exposure have barely been investigated. Isocyanate skin absorption likely depends on various factors including molecular size and coexposures (e.g., polyols, solvents, and other additives), which could enhance absorption. The role of host factors, such as history of eczema and hand washing, warrant further investigation, as does the effectiveness of gloves, protective clothing, and other preventive strategies.

Conclusion
Munn (1965)
:
The more one knows about these fascinating compounds [isocyanates] the more fascinated one becomes. So diverse are their uses, it is obvious that they are here to stay, and that their use will increase. So numerous have been the accounts of their effects, it is obvious not merely they are hazardous but that the nature and extent of their hazard has not always been fully appreciated.
