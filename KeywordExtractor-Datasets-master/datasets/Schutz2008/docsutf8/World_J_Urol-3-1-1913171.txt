To study the influence of microwave induced thermo-chemotherapy on high-grade urothelial cell carcinomas. Five groups of each three patients were formed of whom initial biopsies and cystectomy samples were collected. Patients were treated 2 days prior to cystectomy with mitomycin-C (group 1), hyperthermia (group 2) or thermo-chemotherapy (group 3). Group 4 patients had been treated with a cycle of six thermo-chemotherapy treatments prior to cystectomy and group 5 patients served as control (no treatment). Tumour samples were stained with Haematoxylin and Eosin, monoclonal antibody Ki-67 and the monoclonal antibody p53. In six out of the nine patients treated with hyperthermia a decrease in proliferation activity in the tumour was found. Seven out of nine patients treated with hyperthermia showed a decrease in p53 activity. A decrease in proliferation activity and p53 activity illustrate the potential role of thermo-chemotherapy as a promising intravesical treatment.

Introduction

]. Bladder cancer incidence is still rising moderately in most developed countries. Of all these malignant bladder tumours, more than 90% are transitional cell carcinomas of which two third is superficial and one third is muscle invasive. The management of these two types of transitional cell carcinoma differs enormously. The management of superficial bladder cancer consists of transurethral resection in the first place, whereas the primary treatment for muscle invasive bladder cancer consists of cystectomy, a complete different approach.

In this descriptive study the influence of different treatment modalities on bladder tumours (thermo-chemotherapy, chemotherapy and thermotherapy) was investigated by several immunohistochemical stainings.

]. This system consists of a 915 MHz intravesical microwave applicator that delivers hyperthermia of the bladder walls via direct irradiation. The applicator is part of the specially designed 20F transurethral catheter. The catheter also contains five thermocouples. Two thermocouples measure the temperature in the prostatic urethral tract; the other three are spread out and pushed tangentially against the posterior and lateral walls of the bladder. To avoid urethral overheating, the solution is continuously pumped out of the bladder and re-instilled after being cooled. Hyperthermia was delivered within a temperature range of 41–42°C.
Group 3 patients were treated 2 days before cystectomy with two times 30 min intravesical MMC (20 mg in 50 ml sterile water) combined with local microwave induced hyperthermia delivered by the SB-TS 101 system. Group 4 patients were treated with a cycle of six thermo-chemotherapy treatments during the last 3 months. Finally, group 5 patients served as control group. These patients did not receive any intravesical instillations within 3 months prior to cystectomy.

Immunohistochemistry
All tumour tissue samples were fixed in a 10% buffered formaldehyde solution. The specimens were embedded in paraffin blocks and sections of 4 μm were cut. All specimens were deparaffinized and stained with Haematoxylin and Eosin. A microscopic examination of the samples was performed and the extend of inflammation (1+ to 3+) haemorrhage (1+ to 3+) were semi quantitatively scored.

 in a 40% methanol solution was used for 30 min to block endogenous peroxidase activity. Slides were pre-treated with 10% normal swine serum for 10 min to block non-specific staining followed by adding primary antibody DO-7 for 1 h at 20°C. After extensive rinsing, sections were incubated for 30 min with biotinylated swine anti mouse antibody (1:200 dilution) and then for 30 min with avidin-biotin complexes (1:50 dilution) at 20°C. Diaminobenzidine (DAB) staining were finally followed by haematoxylin nuclear counter staining. The slides were dehydrated and mounted with a xylene-soluble mounting medium.

Immunoreactivity scoring
The screening of tumour tissue samples was performed by two independent investigators (CH and AH). The sections were screened for positive cells, defined as cells with nuclear staining. The amount of Ki67 or p53 staining is scored in percentages. The threshold for p53 “positivity” is ≥20% positive staining. The areas with maximal immunohistochemical staining were used for scoring. In total, 300–500 tumour cells were scored. In the visual estimation only definitely brown nuclei were recorded as positive. The results were expressed as percentage of immunoreactive tumour cell nuclei.

The intensity of inflammation increased in three out of nine patients treated with hyperthermia. In three out of five patients from the MMC group and control group an increase was seen. The intensity of haemorrhage increased in four out of nine patients treated with hyperthermia, one patient showed a decrease and four patients did not show any difference. In the MMC group and in the control group two patients showed an increase, one patient a decrease and two patients did not show any difference.

]. In this study hyperthermia was delivered within a temperature range of 41–42°C, the clinical situation. This makes comparison between the different groups more accurate.
The sample size of the group studied is small due to the fact that recruitment of patients was difficult. Patients had to agree on an extra treatment session only two days before cystectomy, which did not give them any benefit at all.

 = 2). In the group treated with thermo-chemotherapy 2 days before surgery the degree of inflammation was initially already maximal. In the group treated with a cycle of six thermo-chemotherapy treatments during the last 3 months the degree of inflammation apparently had returned to baseline again.
At least one patient per group (except the control group) showed an increase in the degree of haemorrhage. Patients from group 1 (solely MMC) showed the highest degree of haemorrhage.
13
]. Nevertheless, since solely MMC and solely hyperthermia gives an increase in haemorrhage, it would have been logical to find a higher extend of haemorrhage after the combination of both treatments. Possibly, this is not found due to the small sample size.

]. However, in these in vitro studies solely hyperthermia did not cause a significant decrease in cell proliferation. Nevertheless, there is a difference between in vitro and in vivo studies. This in vivo study is the first one showing a decreased proliferation activity in humans treated with microwave-induced hyperthermia with or without MMC. The effect of hyperthermia was seen in six out of nine patients treated with hyperthermia preceding cystectomy.
Furthermore, the group treated with solely MMC did not show a significant decrease in proliferation activity. This is probably due to the limited penetration properties of this intravesical used drug, especially after one single treatment.
p53 is known to be responsible for repair or apoptosis in response to DNA damage. The p53 activity, in other words the expression of mutant p53, decreased exclusively in patients treated with hyperthermia with or without MMC.

]. Furthermore the results of this study are based on a small number of patients, which makes statistic analysis unreliable. On the other hand, the current results suggest that thermo-chemotherapy could be an effective treatment in patients with a p53 tumour suppressor gene mutated tumour. In all, the results show several trends and encourage carrying out larger experimental studies.

Conclusion
The degree of inflammation and haemorrhage in bladder tumours did not increase in patients treated with hyperthermia. This, in combination with a decrease in proliferation activity and a decrease in p53 activity, implies that thermo-chemotherapy is a safe and promising treatment.
