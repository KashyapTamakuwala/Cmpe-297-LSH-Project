Chronic kidney disease (CKD) in children is irreversible. It is associated with renal failure progression and atherosclerotic cardiovascular (CV) abnormalities. Nearly 60% of children with CKD are affected since birth with congenital or inherited kidney disorders. Preliminary evidence primarily from adult CKD studies indicates common genetic risk factors for CKD and atherosclerotic CV disease. Although multiple physiologic pathways share common genes for CKD and CV disease, substantial evidence supports our attention to the renin angiotensin system (RAS) and the interlinked inflammatory cascade because they modulate the progressions of renal and CV disease. Gene polymorphisms in the RAS-cytokine pathway, through altered gene expression of inflammatory cytokines, are potential factors that modulate the rate of CKD progression and CV abnormalities in patients with CKD. For studying such hypotheses, the cooperative efforts among scientific groups and the availability of robust and affordable technologies to genotype thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across the genome make genome-wide association studies an attractive paradigm for studying polygenic diseases such as CKD. Although attractive, such studies should be interpreted carefully, with a fundamental understanding of their potential weaknesses. Nevertheless, whole-genome association studies for diabetic nephropathy and future studies pertaining to other types of CKD will offer further insight for the development of targeted interventions to treat CKD and associated atherosclerotic CV abnormalities in the pediatric CKD population.

Insights gained by understanding how variations in this pathway influence the progressions of renal and CV disease will lead to hypotheses for targeted interventions to treat CKD and associated atherosclerotic CV abnormalities in the pediatric CKD population.

Genetic polymorphisms

Table 1
Glossary of common genetic terms

Alleles:
 Alternate sequences of the same gene, one inherited from each parent.

Biological pathway:
 A set of proteins that interact to produce normal and abnormal physiology.

Candidate gene:
 A gene in which variants could plausibly explain a given phenotype, such as severity of disease or variable response to drug. Methods to identify candidate genes include basic science studies, identifying DNA sequences conserved across species, human genetics, epidemiologic association studies, or genome-wide analyses.

Epigenetics:
 Heritable change in the pattern of gene expression mediated by mechanism other than alterations in the primary nucleotide sequence of gene.

Genome:
 The collection of all DNA in an organism. Only a small proportion (probably <3%) of human genomes encodes proteins.

Genotype:
 The genetic makeup of an individual, which may refer to the whole genome or to specific genes or regions of genes.

Haplotype:
 A set of genetic variants that are inherited together. Polymorphisms that are coinherited more often than by chance alone are in linkage disequilibrium (LD). Haplotype blocks may include many individual polymorphisms in high LD; as a result, establishing genotype at any single polymorphic site with such a block may establish genotypes at linked sites within the block. Individual single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that can be used to establish genotype within a haplotype block are termed tag SNPs.

Heterozygous:
 Having different alleles in a specific region of DNA.

Homozygous:
 Having the same alleles in a specific region of DNA

Phenotype:
 Measurable characteristics of an organism. These may derive from genotype, environment, or the combination. Organisms with the same phenotype can have different genotypes.

Polymorphisms:
 DNA variants that are common, often defined as >1% in a given population. Polymorphisms can be in coding regions (where they may be synonymous or nonsynonymous) or, more commonly, in noncoding regions, and often vary by ethnicity. The most common type of polymorphism is a change in one nucleotide (base pair) in a DNA sequence, referred to as an SNP. Other polymorphisms are insertion and deletion of multiple sequential nucleotides (indels); variable numbers of repeats, such as doublets or triplets; or large-scale duplications or deletions. Although some genetic variants are known to alter protein abundance or function, the functional consequences of most polymorphisms are unknown.

Tag SNPs:
 These are maximally informative SNPs that characterize common haplotypes.

Conclusions
Genetic association studies have the potential to provide new insights into the factors responsible for CKD renal and CV progression. These investigations provide hope for new drug targets to treat or modify individual disease risk. In the case of CKD, genetic polymorphisms in the RAS–cytokine pathway may be responsible for the intraindividual variation in renal and cardiac progression in patients with CKD and may offer new targets for drug therapy.
The Human Genome and HapMap projects have made it possible to evaluate a multitude of candidate genes that might be linked to CKD progression. The enthusiasm for these investigations must be tempered by acknowledging the limitations of gene association studies. Attention to biologic plausibility and appropriate study design will help the interpretability of published results. Independent investigations replicating initial findings are needed to support an inference of a causal association between the gene polymorphism of interest and the disease phenotype.
