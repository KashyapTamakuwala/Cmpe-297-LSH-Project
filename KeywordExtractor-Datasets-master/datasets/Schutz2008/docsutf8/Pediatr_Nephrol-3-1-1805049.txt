]. The predisposing conditions of hyperphosphatemia and high (calcium×phosphorus) concentration products need to be persistent over weeks and months, since MC has been not been described in the setup of acute renal failure (even though a similar biochemical profile is seen there too).
We describe a case of MC in a 10-month-old child presenting with hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) and acute renal failure (ARF).

]. ST was shown to be successful in the treatment of both nephrolithiasis and tumoral calcinosis. ST has antioxidant effects on endothelial cells, but its exact mechanism of effect is unclear. It undergoes mainly renal clearance. Its half-life is increased from 15 min in the normal glomerular filtration rate (GFR) to 478 min in dialysis-dependent patients. The recommended adult dose is 12.5–25 g at the end of dialysis. The duration of this treatment is unclear. In our patient, a short ST course plus the withdrawal of enteral calcium and vitamin D were sufficient to resolve MC, which did not recur in the following events of HUS.
