 channel TREK-1, Brain Natriuretic Peptide and Endothelin-1 receptor B, were significantly greater in ENDO than EPI. No targets had significantly greater mRNA levels in EPI than ENDO. On the basis of these findings, we suggest that the response of the ventricle to stretch will depend upon both the regional differences in stimuli and the relative expression of the mechanosensitive targets and that generally, stretch sensitivity is predicted to be greater in ENDO.

Materials and methods
All animal experimentation was carried out in accordance with the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 and the local Institutional ethical review panel.
Isolation of RNA
Tris
-HCl [pH 7.5], 1 mM ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid) before use in real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR).

Real-time RT-PCR
Real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) was performed using TaqMan low-density arrays (Micro Fluidic Cards, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Each card consisted of 384 wells, preloaded with pre-designed fluorogenic TaqMan probes and primers, configured to allow detection of 48 transcripts for 7 experimental and 1 calibrator samples. Our calibrator sample consisted of a mixture of cDNA from EPI and ENDO regions. Each of the eight sample lanes in a card was loaded with 100 μl of a 1:1 mixture of cDNA (equivalent to 77 ng input RNA) and TaqMan Universial PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems). PCR was done according to the recommended protocol (50°C for 2 min and 94.5°C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles at 97°C for 30 s and 59.7°C for 1 min) on an ABI RISM 7900HT Sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). Data were collected with instrument spectral compensations by the Applied Biosystems SDS 2.2 software and analysed using the threshold cycle relative quantification method. Relative transcript expression was normalised to the housekeeper gene GAPDH.

]. In brief, excised hearts were perfused on a Langendorff apparatus with a collagenase/protease containing physiological solution. EPI and ENDO strips, each one third of the wall thickness, were manually cut from the left ventricular free wall with scissors leaving a distinct and intact mid-myocardial region. Further incubation with enzyme solution resulted in the isolation of separate populations of EPI and ENDO myocytes.

Discussion
This investigation of transcripts for proteins sensitive to stretch, or involved in mechanosensitive pathways, has allowed us to detect a number of small but nevertheless significant differences in mRNA levels between ENDO and EPI samples.

Although we found no evidence for a regionally different expression of caveolin-3, an essential component of cardiac caveolae, the role of caveolae may also be influenced by regional expression of the receptors and other signalling molecules that they aggregate. The observation that mRNA for caveolin-1 is greater in ENDO is intriguing as this isoform has only recently been identified in cardiac myocytes, and its role in myocyte caveolae is unknown.
