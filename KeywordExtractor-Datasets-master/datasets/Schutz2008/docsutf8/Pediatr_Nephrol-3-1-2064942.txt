Chronic kidney disease (CKD) occurs in all age groups, including children. Regardless of the underlying cause, CKD is characterized by progressive scarring that ultimately affects all structures of the kidney. The relentless progression of CKD is postulated to result from a self-perpetuating vicious cycle of fibrosis activated after initial injury. We will review possible mechanisms of progressive renal damage, including systemic and glomerular hypertension, various cytokines and growth factors, with special emphasis on the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS), podocyte loss, dyslipidemia and proteinuria. We will also discuss possible specific mechanisms of tubulointerstitial fibrosis that are not dependent on glomerulosclerosis, and possible underlying predispositions for CKD, such as genetic factors and low nephron number.

]. Adaptive changes in nephrons after initial injury are postulated ultimately to be maladaptive, eventually causing scarring and further nephron loss, thus perpetuating a vicious cycle that results in the end-stage kidney. We will review possible mechanisms of progressive renal damage, which include, but are not limited to, hemodynamic factors, the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS), various cytokines and growth factors, podocyte loss, dyslipidemia, proteinuria, specific mechanisms of tubulointerstitial fibrosis, and possible underlying predispositions for CKD, such as genetic factors and low nephron number.
Systemic and glomerular hypertension
Systemic hypertension often accompanies renal disease and may both result from, and contribute to, CKD. Progression of CKD is accelerated by hypertension, and control of blood pressure is key in the treatment of CKD. In addition, the glomerulus has a unique structure, with both an afferent and an efferent arteriole, which permits modulation of glomerular perfusion and pressure without corresponding systemic blood pressure change.

However, in two patients with missense mutation of this same gene, FSGS lesions developed, demonstrating that a spectrum of structural abnormalities may arise from varying mutations in the same gene. PLCE1 is expressed in the glomerulus, where it is postulated to play a key role in development, perhaps by interacting with other proteins that are crucial for the development and function of the slit diaphragm.

]. This is in contrast to the diabetic glomerular lesion, where the expanded mesangial area is largely due to increased matrix accumulation rather than hypercellularity. These interstitial cells could possibly represent interstitial myofibroblasts, postulated to play a key role in interstitial fibrosis. These activated interstitial cells are a major source of collagen synthesis, and increased expression of α-smooth muscle actin (SMA), a marker of myofibroblasts, predicts progressive renal dysfunction both in human and experimental renal disease.

These observations suggest that complex genetic traits can modulate the response of glomerular cells to pathogenic stimuli in experimental models. Whether ethnic differences in development of renal disease in humans reflect contributions of genetic and/or environmental influences remains to be definitively determined.

ANSWERS:
1. (c) is the correct answer. Podocin mutation occurs in only up to approximately 25% of steroid-resistant NS patients. Minimal-change disease is less likely, as he is steroid resistant and African American. Diffuse mesangial sclerosis is very rare beyond early childhood. Although collapsing glomerulopathy is more frequent in African American than in Caucasian adults, this form of FSGS is more rare than usual-type FSGS, especially in children.
2. (c) is the correct answer. ACEI is referred as initial treatment for proteinuric patients at risk for CKD, even if they have normal blood pressure. If proteinuria does not respond to ACEI alone, added treatment with ARB may be considered, to decrease proteinuria and, likely, to decrease the decline in GFR. Although diuretic treatment may be warranted for edema, it does not have specific effects to decrease risk of CKD. Spironolactone may provide additional benefit based on early results in proteinuric CKD patients, in addition to ACEI and ARB. Beta blocker is not indicated in this patient without hypertension.
3. (d) is the correct answer. In this normotensive patient, the effect of therapy on proteinuria is the best indicator of therapeutic efficacy. If the patient develops hypertension, then normalization of blood pressure would be an additional important target for therapy. Edema is also a parameter for evaluation of need for diuretic treatment but not of direct importance for progression of CKD. The drugs listed do not have specific effects on WBC count.
4. (e) is the correct answer. In this patient with sclerosing lesions, podocyte loss may contribute to progressive damage. Proteinuria is also likely a contributor to interstitial fibrosis, which may be contributed to by infiltrating macrophages. Her blood pressure is elevated, and she likely also has intraglomerular hypertension.
5. (e) is the correct answer. In this patient, the likely underlying diagnosis is minimal-change disease, in that he has steroid-dependent nephrotic syndrome and still has normal serum creatinine after 6 years of relapsing disease. Podocyte loss is not a feature of minimal-change disease. Proteinuria could be a contributor to interstitial fibrosis, more likely if he does not just have selective proteinuria. Dyslipidemia may contribute to renal as well as cardiovascular injury. His blood pressure is normal, as is his serum creatinine, and therefore he likely has normal intraglomerular pressure.
