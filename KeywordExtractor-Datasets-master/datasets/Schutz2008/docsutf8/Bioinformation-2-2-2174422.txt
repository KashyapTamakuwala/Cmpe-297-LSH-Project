	Telomeres and centromere are two essential features of all eukaryotic chromosomes. They provide function that is necessary for the stability of chromosomes. 
	We developed a comprehensive database named TeCK, which covers a gamut of sequence and other related information about telomeric patterns, telomere repeat 
	sequences, centromere sequences and centromeric patterns present in chromosomes. It also contains information about telomerase ribo-nucleoprotein complexes, 
	centromere binding protein and centromere DNA-binding protein complexes. The database also includes a collection of all kinetochore-associated proteins including 
	inner, outer and central kinetochore proteins.  The database can be searched using a user-friendly web interface.

], it divides more often, and its telomeres become very short, 
causing death of cells, which can be prevented by activating the enzyme telomerase. By understanding these regions of chromosomes, cancer and aging can be treated effectively and 
thus is a potential target of drug design approach. Hence, a database for analyzing and interpreting  chromosomal information is essential. So far there had been no attempts to 
annotate and curate these parts of chromosomes.

a protein database. About 154 entries are obtained for telomerase, 162 entries are obtained for centromere binding proteins and 170 entries are obtained for kinetochore. Hyperlinks are 
provided to the corresponding databases for each entry with their IDs displayed.

has been installed for searching similar sequences.

]. The sequences are displayed in 
FASTA format and the retrieval can be done using a separate ‘retrieve in FASTA format’ link. BLASTn can be done against TeCK database & NCBI and BLASTp against TeCK database, SwissProt & PDB.

Utility
As TeCK database includes name, function, sequence, subunits, and other literature information. The data for TeCK database were obtained from various curated databases and hence TeCK database helps end users 
to study, compare, analyze and interpret them and finds utility in control of cancer and ageing.  

Caveats
It should be noted that the consistency depends on the source of the original data.
