We conclude that the combination of lovastatin and TRAIL enhances apoptosis synergistically. Moreover, lovastatin sensitized glioblastoma cells to TRAIL, suggesting a new strategy to treat glioblastoma.

], and many successful anti-cancer agents induce apoptosis by damaging DNA. Unfortunately such agents may also severely affect normal cells. Given the fact that both lovastatin and TRAIL are non-chemotherapeutic agents and capable of inducing apoptosis in different types of cancer cells, it is important to determine whether the combination of these two agents would produce synergistic effects that may be lighten for a novel therapeutic application in gliomas.
We therefore hypothesized that the combination of TRAIL and lovastatin, neither of which alone has noxious effects on healthy cells, could generate a regime that was effective in killing cancer cells but caused minimal insult to normal healthy cells. In this study we report the effects of TRAIL in combination with a non-chemotherapeutic drug, lovastatin, on glioblastoma cells.

Materials and methods
Reagents

]. Cellular DNA fragmentation ELISA kit (Roche, Mannheim, Germany), RNeasy kit, DNA extraction kit (Qiagen, Germany) and RT-PCR kit (Promega, Madison, WI) were used. Three primary antibodies used were as follows: rabbit polyclonal antibody to DR4 (Chemicon International, 1:1,000 dilution), rabbit polyclonal antibody to DR5 (Cell Signaling Technology, 1:1,000 dilution), and rabbit polyclonal antibody to β-tubulin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:1,000 dilution). Goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology.

Cell culture

. Media were changed every 3 days.

Measurement of cell viability
4
 cells were cultured in the serum free DMEM/F12 medium in the presence of lovastatin with or without TRAIL in a 96 well microtiter plate for designated time periods. The medium was aspirated and 100 μl MTT (0.5 mg/ml in PBS) were added to each well and the cells incubated for 3 h. After MTT medium was aspirated, the cells were solubilized in 200 μl DMSO. The optical density of each sample at 570 nm (reference 630 nm) was measured using a microplate reader. The optical density of the media was proportional to the degree of viable cells.

Cell cycle analysis
6
 treated cells were washed with 5 ml PBS and then were trypsinized at 37°C for 5–10 min. Cells were spun down and washed with 5 ml PBS. Finally cells were resuspended in 500 μl PBS and fixed with 4.5 ml 70% Ethanol with gentle vortexing. Cells were allowed to sit in −20°C for overnight. Fixed cells were spun down and washed with 5 ml PBS, and then cells were resuspended in 500 μl PI (2 μg/ml)/Triton X-100 (0.1% v/v) staining solution with RNase A (200 μg/ml) in dark and analyzed by a flow cytometer. The staining solution was purchased from Chemicon (Temecula, CA).

Apoptosis assay
Apoptotic cells were determined by two methods, Annexin-V and PI stained cells by flow cytometry and DNA fragmentation assay. During apoptosis, translocation of phosphatidylserine from inner membrane to outer membrane is a common phenomenon. Cells were stained with Annexin V for analysis of phosphoserine inversion, which was considered to be a sensitive marker of apoptosis. Using an Annexin V-FITC apoptosis detection kit (Molecular Probe Inc, Eugene, OR), the levels of binding of Annexin V and staining with PI were measured for the detection of early and late apoptosis respectively. All of the procedures were preformed under manufacturer’s guidelines. Cells were treated with lovastatin or/and TRAIL for 48 h and then stained with Annexin-V and PI. Viable cells were recognized as negative for both Annexin-V and PI; early apoptotic events were positive for Annexin-V but negative for PI staining. Late apoptotic events were positive to both Annexin V and PI. Necrotic cells were positive for PI staining only.

) were treated with lovastatin and/or TRAIL for 48 h, DNA fragmentation was detected using 96 wells microplate reader.

RT-PCR
Total RNA was isolated using Qiagen RNeasy extraction kit and performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Total RNA (5 μg) was reversely transcribed using Promega RT-PCR kit and thermal program was set at 42°C for 15 min and 95°C for 5 min. PCR reaction was performed using the following primers, which have previously been tested successfully: TRAIL-R1, 5′-CTG AGC AAC GCA GAC TCG CTG TCC AC-3′ and 5′-TCC AAG GAC ACG GCA GAG CCT GTG CCA T-3′; TRAIL-R2, 5′-GCC TCA TGG ACA ATG AGA TAA AGG TGG CT-3′ and 5′-CCA AAT CTC AAA GTA CGC ACA AAC GG-3′; TRAIL-R3, 5′-GAA GAA TTT GGT GCC AAT GCC ACT G-3′ and 5′-CTC TTG GAC TTG GCT GGG AGA TGT G-3′; TRAIL-R4, 5′-CTT TTC CGG CGG CGT TCA TGT CCT TC-3′ and 5′-GTT TCT TCC AGG CTG CTT CCC TTT GTA G-3′. The thermal program was set up as one cycle at 94°C for 5 min, 30 cycles at 94°C for 1 min, 55°C for 1 min, 72°C for 2 min, and one cycle at 72°C for 5 min. PCR products were resolved and visualized on a 2% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide.

]. Experts disagree over the functions of DNA-PK in cell regulation. DNA-PK has been reported to promote cell death by interacting with telomeres, whereas other reports suggest that DNA-PK protects cells from cell death via caspase-independent or p53 independent pathways. The reason for this paradoxical finding remains unknown.
This study demonstrated a synergistic interaction between lovastatin and TRAIL, but the mechanisms of action by which lovastatin sensitized glioblastoma cells remains unknown. Our results are in agreement with the concept of combined cancer therapeutic action via both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic cell death pathways. This combination of non-chemotherapeutic agents, TRAIL and lovastatin, may offer a potential regime for glioblastoma treatment.
