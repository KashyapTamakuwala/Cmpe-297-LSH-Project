Background
Psychiatric epidemiological surveys in developing countries are rare and are frequently conducted in regions that are not necessarily representative of the entire country. In addition, in large countries with dispersed populations national rates may have low value for estimating the need for mental health services and programs.

Methods
The Chile Psychiatric Prevalence Study using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview was conducted in four distinct regions of the country on a stratified random sample of 2,978 people. Lifetime and 12-month prevalence and service utilization rates were estimated.

Results
Significant differences in the rates of major depressive disorder, substance abuse disorders, non-affective psychosis, and service utilization were found across the regions. The differential prevalence rates could not be accounted by socio-demographic differences between sites.

Conclusions
Regional differences across countries may exist that have both implications for prevalence rates and service utilization. Planning mental health services for population centers that span wide geographical areas based on studies conducted in a single region may be misleading, and may result in areas with high need being underserved.

An understanding of regional differences in countries where the population is spread across large distances is relevant for health care planning. Potentially risk factors may differ across a country resulting in the need to address mental health needs on a regional basis rather than centrally. Furthermore, an understanding of geographic variability permits allocation of resources to be distributed in a proportional basis by need.

] are extrapolated to larger population bases for which they may or may not be representative.
Population studies about psychiatric disorders in Latin America, as well as other developing regions of the world, are rare. They are important, however, for understanding variations in patterns of disorders, underlying determinants, and service needs. Chile, given its rather extraordinary geography provides an important test of variations in disorder rates across a spatially dispersed population, and offers perhaps the best case example of a country where national rates would seemingly have low value for estimating the need for mental health services and programs.

 (including Antarctica and Insular Territories) over a length of 8,000 km. The large distances between major population centers resulted in the CPPS being conducted in four regions of the country, Bio Bio, the south-central region containing the second largest city, Metropolitana, the north-central region which includes the capital Santiago, Tarapaca, the north, and Araucania, the south of the country, in order to obtain a representative sampling of the population of the nation. This report focuses on whether regional differences in the prevalence of psychiatric disorders and service utilization, if present, are due to factors other than socio-demographic differences between population centers.
Methods
Sample selection
21
]. The sample frame was developed to be representative of the nation’s population. Four regions and their most representative province and comunas were selected. These were subsequently subdivided into districts, and then randomly selected blocks. The number of households available on each block was enumerated. The 1992 census of each region was used to determine the number of households required on each block. A list of the inhabitants, age 15 and older, in each household was generated. Using pre-assigned Kish tables (Kish 1965) one person per household was selected from the list to be interviewed.

 < 0.02) with Metropolitana having the highest non-response rate 12.6% and Tarapaca the lowest 7.5%. A weight was used to account for the probability of the comuna, district, block, household, and respondent being selected. The data was adjusted to the 1992 census of each region based on age, gender, and marital status using a second weight.

]. The DSM-III-R diagnoses included in this report are all affective disorders; all anxiety disorders defined as panic disorder, agoraphobia, and generalized anxiety disorder; substance use disorder which does not include nicotine dependence, and any diagnosis. Lifetime and 12-month prevalence rates were examined.

Interviewers and training
Social science university students in their senior year underwent training following the WHO protocol at the University of Concepcion, a WHO CIDI training and reference center. The 64 interviewers received over 80 h of instruction and practice sessions. Each interviewer had to conduct practice interviews with volunteer adult subjects with and without psychiatric disorders selected from local clinics, as well as a pilot interview on an individual in a non-selected household in the community. Approximately 80% of the interviews were audiotaped following the subject’s consent, and 20% randomly reviewed for quality control.

Analysis procedures
27
], Taylor series linearization method, was used to estimate the standard errors due to the sample design and the need for weighting. The analysis was conducted using procedures without replacement for non-respondents. The comuna and district selected were used as the defined strata. Chi-square analyses were used to examine the association of disorders and service utilization between regions. Logistic regression was used to adjust for socio-demographic differences across regions accounting for differential rates or service utilization. Additional analyses were conducted to examine urban–rural differences. The logistic regression analyses included gender, marital status, age group, education, and income as potential confounders. All results are presented as weighted data.

Using logistic regression controlling for socio-demographic variables the regional differences for major depression were maintained for both lifetime and 12-month prevalence, as well as among females in both prevalence periods. Males with lifetime prevalent affective disorders were also at increased risk in Tarapaca. In addition regional differences in lifetime prevalence for alcohol abuse, drug abuse, and nicotine dependence were found. Among females, regional differences in lifetime prevalence were noted for drug abuse, drug dependence, any alcohol or drug use disorder, and cognitive disorders, and among men alcohol abuse with increased risk among those residing in Tarapaca. The statistical differences in regional lifetime prevalence of non-affective psychosis for both genders combined, and females in both prevalence periods, persisted with the rates for Araucania remaining low. As the rates for not only major depression, but also alcohol and drug use disorders were elevated in Tarapaca, additional analyses were conducted controlling for comorbidity in the logistic regressions, the regional differences noted were not altered.

. The lower use of services persisted after controlling for socio-demographic variables in a logistic regression.
When urban versus rural was examined across all sites no statistical differences in the rates of disorders were noted. In addition, there were no socio-demographic differences. The sample size of the rural population was small, 203.

Discussion
28
]. The small sample size of the rural population precluded finding statistically significant differences.
The utilization of health service was lowest in Araucania and Bio Bio. This may be consistent with the inequities in availability and access that do exist in health and mental health resources across different regions of Chile. The southern half of the country is the poorest and has the least resources; therefore, the lower rates may be due to a lack of access rather than demand. For example across the regions the number of available mental health beds 2001 in the public health service per 100,000 were Araucania 2.2; Bio Bio 4.8; Metropolitana 34.2; and Tarapaca 47.2. The number of primary care physicians per 100,000 populations also was lowest in Araucania, 57.0, compared to Bio Bio with 169.7, Tarapaca with 61.6 and Metropolitana with 185.8.
It could be argued that these regional differences are simply artifact due to sampling differences. Clearly the population investigated in Tarapaca is small for a prevalence study and may have resulted in rates that may prove unstable. Another potential limitation is that the four regions were investigated sequentially, with the potential for socio-cultural influences to impact on the rates during the intervals between data collection. The high proportion of low-income individuals in the Bio Bio sample in comparison to the other sites and in particular Aracucania, the poorest region of the country, reflects the improved economic conditions in Chile during the course of data collection and supports a cohort effect. A cohort effect, however, is highly unlikely to explain the rates of psychopathology given that data collection was obtained from Araucania last, yet it has the highest rate of major depressive disorder.

Conclusion
6
29
] have ignored large segments of the population, such as those countries and regions of countries with large indigenous populations or segments of the population that are very poor. Fewer studies in the region have examined service needs and none have addressed regional differences in services. Data that is more representative of the Latin American population is needed in order to improve mental health services planning and addresses the large under-estimated treatment gap.
