We therefore undertook a multicenter prospective controlled study of TA-assisted pars plana vitrectomy (PPV). Considering the enduring nature of the effect of PPV on ocular tissue, it is important to investigate the long-term results in order to evaluate TA-assisted PPV. Moreover, the crucial issue of the effects on patients’ vision must be explored before TA-assisted PPV can be recommended. The current report presents the 1-year results of the use of TA in PPV, and evaluates the procedure in light of the aforementioned issues.

Methods

]. Data analysis was performed by an intent-to-treat analysis method. To conceal the allocations at the participating hospitals, the surgeons were not informed of the group to which a patient had been assigned until immediately before surgery.

Eligibility criteria and surgery
Institutional review board (IRB)/ethics committee approval was obtained from all of the participating clinical establishments, such that all patients undergoing PPV at these hospitals were eligible to enroll in the study. Each patient was fully informed about the nature of the treatment, and provided written consent. The following groups were excluded: (1) patients with diagnoses that included macular holes; patients with uveitis, (2) patients with phakic lenses, (3) patients who were known to be steroid responders, to have glaucoma, or to have apparent infectious endophthalmitis, and (4) patients who were undergoing a second PPV. For ethical reasons, if at the time of surgery a surgeon felt that TA was necessary to achieve a successful PPV outcome, it was included in the procedure; for the purposes of the intent-to-treat analysis, these cases were included within the conventional PPV group.

].
During the follow-up period, additional surgeries were performed at each hospital as and when they were needed. For example, filtering surgeries were performed when the intra-ocular pressure (IOP) remained at an uncontrollably high level (25 mmHg or greater) even with full medication. Full medication included the use of all latanoprost, beta-blocker, and dorzolamide hydrochloride eyedrops and acetazolamide medicine.
13
]. For the purposes of this study, the adverse events related to surgery were defined as follows: retinal breaks, macular pucker, retinal fibrous membrane formation, retinal detachment, vitreous hemorrhage (VH), rubeosis iridis, optic-disc damage, corneal diseases, and after cataract. The serious adverse events related to surgery were defined as follows: infectious endophthalmitis, retinal degeneration, unexplained optic-disc damage, and unexplained deterioration of vision.

Masking and outcome assessment
The study records were collected by the principal investigator (TS) up until November 2006. After checking the records for harmful events, the data were sent to the controllers (YN) at Kyushu University. The remaining investigators were not permitted access to any information on the outcomes before completion of the analysis. Visual acuity was measured by ophthalmic technicians using the Snellen high-contrast acuity test. IOP was also measured by the ophthalmic technicians, and the findings were reviewed by the physicians. IOP was measured with pneumotonometer. The ophthalmic technicians were not informed of the purpose of the study or the assignment schedule. Anti-glaucoma eye drops and/or acetazolamide were used when an IOP of 22 mmHg or higher persisted for 3 days.

Statistical analysis
The visual acuity was converted to the logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (LogMAR), and the baseline value was compared with those at 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year. The eyes were categorized into the following three groups: (1) the improved group, in which patients showed a 0.3 logMAR or greater improvement of visual acuity at the final examination compared with baseline, (2) the deteriorated group, in which patients showed a 0.3 logMAR or worse deterioration of visual acuity at the final examination compared with baseline, and (3) the unchanged group, in which patients did not meet the criteria of either the improved or the deteriorated group.
A Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to estimate the probability of improved visual acuity with time after surgery. The improvement or deterioration was analyzed by the log rank test. The earliest time point after surgery at which the events in each category were reported was designated as the time point of each event.
P
 values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

Discussion

]. Thus, the sample size might not have been large enough to detect the superiority or inferiority of TA-assisted PPV. For example, in order to detect the difference of post-operative improvement of vision in TA-assisted PPV and conventional PPV based upon the present results, approximately 29,315 cases in each group are necessary with α power of 0.05 and 1-β of 0.8. However, considering the relative stability of the visual acuity observed here, we are confident that the intra-operative use of TA does not have a positive or negative effect on postoperative visual acuity for 1 year.

]. In contrast to intravitreous TA injection, most of the TA was removed from the eye at the end of the surgery. Thus, it was plausible that the necessity of filtering surgery in TA-assisted PPV was not significant. The other causes of additional surgery occurred at similar frequencies, and there were no significant differences between the groups. A diagnosis of PDR was a significant factor for the requirement for additional surgery, as it was for the improvement of visual acuity. Furthermore, in our earlier report on the 3-month follow-up study, a diagnosis of PDR was found to be a significant risk factor for the occurrence of intra-operative complications. PDR eyes thus appear to have several poor prognostic factors, consistent with the present results.

]. In the current study group, the removal of the residual posterior hyaloid was carried out according to the surgeons’ preference—some surgeons removed it completely, while others did not. This might have obscured any potential advantage of the intra-operative use of TA in inhibiting post-operative pre-retinal fibrosis.

]. An analysis of a greater number of cases will thus be necessary to evaluate the risk of endophthalmitis related to TA-assisted PPV. However, the present sample size was large enough to detect several factors that affected post-operative visual acuity or the need for additional surgery. Another limitation was that the post-operative visual acuity was strongly influenced by the diagnosis of disease. Eyes with simple VH clearly had a greater chance of surgery improving vision above the baseline level than did eyes with complicated PDR. In order to evaluate the influence of the intra-operative use of TA on visual acuity more precisely, we are currently performing a study on eyes with the same disease diagnosis. Furthermore, the subgroup of DME or ERM in each group was not completely matched. The interpretation of the results should be done carefully. Additionally, caution must be applied when making generalizations on the basis of our current results, and their application to clinical practice must be undertaken with care. Other factors, such as invasiveness and cost, are also important in seeking justification for this treatment. The success of surgery depends upon various factors, and surgical skill is critical. When considering the likelihood of retinal breaks and their recovery without damaging vision, comparisons of the hazard ratios of TA-assisted PPV and conventional PPV would be valid only if made by individuals who qualify as PPV specialists.
In summary, the intra-operative use of TA in PPV did not affect visual acuity over 1 year. As negative or adverse events were not observed in this case series, a more detailed study is warranted to establish the value of TA in PPV.
