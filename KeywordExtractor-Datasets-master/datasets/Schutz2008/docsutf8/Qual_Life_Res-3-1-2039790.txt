Background
Few studies have evaluated patients’ perceived burden of cancer surveillance tests. Cancer screening and surveillance, however, require a large number of patients to undergo potentially burdensome tests with only some experiencing health gains from it. We investigated the determinants of patients’ reported burden of upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy by comparing data from three patient groups.

Patients and methods
A total of 476 patients were included: 180 patients under regular surveillance for Barrett esophagus (BE), a premalignant disorder; 214 patients with non-specific upper GI symptoms (NS), and 82 patients recently diagnosed with upper GI cancer (CA). We assessed pain, discomfort and overall burden experienced during endoscopy, symptoms in the week afterwards and psychological distress over time (Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale and Impact of Event Scale).

Results
Two-thirds (66%) of patients reported discomfort and overall burden of upper GI endoscopy. Only 23% reported any pain. BE patients reported significantly less discomfort, pain and overall burden than the other patients: those with NS reported more discomfort, CA patients more pain, and both more overall burden. These differences could be statistically explained by the number of previous endoscopies and whether sedation was provided or not, but not by patient characteristics.

Conclusion
The perception of upper GI endoscopy varies by patient group, due to potential adaptation after multiple endoscopies and aspects of the procedure.

Studying the determinants of patients’ perceived burden of upper GI endoscopy, e.g. by comparing data from different patient groups, may allow for the identification of patient groups who are likely to experience more pain or discomfort than others. This information can be used in practice guidelines, e.g. on provision of sedation to prevent pain and discomfort, or other types of patient support. Studying determinants of patients’ perceived burden is of additional interest from the perspective of evaluation research. If patients’ perception of the burden of endoscopy differs by the context of e.g., surveillance or diagnostic work-up, the generalisability of data from one context to another is limited.
16
] has shown that BE patients under regular surveillance perceive upper GI endoscopy as burdensome. They experienced anxiety and discomfort, but hardly reported pain or symptoms. We analysed potential determinants of the perceived burden of upper GI endoscopy by comparing BE patients with two additional patient groups, i.e., patients with non-specific upper GI symptoms (NS) and patients with a recent diagnosis of cancer of the upper GI tract (CA).

Methods
Ethics approval
The Medical Ethical Review Board of Erasmus MC—University Medical Center Rotterdam, The Netherlands, approved of the study (MEC 03.1064; October 9, 2003).

Patients
16
]. Inclusion criteria were: BE segment of 2 cm or more confirmed by a histological diagnosis of intestinal metaplasia, absence of high-grade dysplasia and carcinoma, willingness to adhere to endoscopic surveillance, ability to read the Dutch language and informed consent.

Patients with non-specific upper GI symptoms (NS) were referred for endoscopy by their respective GPs because of non-specific upper GI symptoms. They needed to be able to read the Dutch language, provide informed consent, not to have “alarm symptoms” such as hematemesis, melena, or dysphagia, and not be diagnosed with BE previously.

plus
 ultrasonography (EUS) to determine therapeutic options. Ability to read the Dutch language and to give informed consent was also required in these patients. Patients were recruited from one academic and two regional hospitals for BE, two regional hospitals for NS and in one academic hospital for CA.

Psychological distress (CA patients)
For CA patients we omitted the HAD and the IES measures regarding the endoscopy itself, because we expected that distress in these patients was already at the top of the scale, making any additional distress caused by the procedure itself indiscernible. The IES to assess specific distress regarding the endoscopy result was included in the questionnaire at the day of endoscopy, because these patients received the endoscopy results earlier than the next questionnaire.

Demographics and other data

Discussion
This study is the first to investigate determinants of patients’ perceived burden of upper GI endoscopy. Patients undergoing endoscopy for different reasons reported a different burden from the procedure. BE patients who underwent endoscopy as part of regular surveillance, reported the lowest discomfort, pain and overall burden, confirming our hypotheses in this respect. Patients with non-specific GI complaints reported more discomfort from the procedure, while those diagnosed with cancer experienced more pain and both groups reported more overall burden than patients under surveillance for BE. These differences remained significant after adjustment for confounders (age, sex, employment status). Differences in baseline anxiety scores or in baseline general health (EQ–5D) did not explain the differences in reported discomfort or pain. Differences in the number of previous endoscopies, and in whether sedation was provided during endoscopy or not, explained part of the differences in reported discomfort between NS and BE patients. Whether sedation was provided or not did not explain the differences in reported pain and overall burden between BE and CA patients.
The study also confirms that that upper GI endoscopy is burdensome for all groups of patients: two-thirds of the total group of patients reported discomfort and overall burden from the procedure, and patients were distressed beforehand. These results may however underestimate the actual burden because this empirical study was limited to patients who actually underwent upper GI endoscopy, hence excluding patients who refrained from undergoing endoscopy because of past or anticipated adverse experiences. Another potential limitation of our study results from the differences in response rates between the groups.
Differences between patient groups were also found for symptoms resulting from the endoscopy. Of all symptoms explored, only throat ache increased after upper GI endoscopy. CA patients reported a higher increase in throat ache than BE patients and NS patients. As upper GI endoscopy hardly caused any symptoms, we considered an investigation into determinants of these differences to be less interesting and therefore omitted those analyses.
Furthermore, BE and NS patients differed in the levels of generic (HAD) and specific (IES) distress they reported. Specific distress (IES) was significantly higher in NS patients than in BE patients, both regarding the endoscopy itself and its result. General distress (HAD) also differed between groups: BE patients reported less depression across all measurements and the pattern of anxiety and depression across measurements was different. However, general distress is not necessarily related to the endoscopy. The persistent higher depression scores across different time points suggest that NS patients have more depressive symptoms in general but that this was not related to the endoscopy. The different pattern of anxiety levels before and after endoscopy, however, suggests that the patient groups also differed in endoscopy-related distress. The pattern corroborated the findings of the specific (IES) distress scores: NS patients were more distressed than BE patients before the endoscopy. The investigated determinants did not explain the differences between groups in specific distress or general distress pattern, except for the number of previous endoscopies explaining part of the difference in the depression scores.
BE patients thus reported less distress and also less pain or discomfort than other patient groups. This was not caused by differences in patient characteristics (age, sex, employment status, baseline anxiety, baseline general health). There are several potential reasons why the reported burden differs. Firstly, BE patients are under regular surveillance and may get used to or adapt to the procedure decreasing its burden. As the number of previous endoscopies explained the lower distress, discomfort and overall burden reported in the BE group, we conclude that getting used, or adapting to endoscopy plays a role.
Secondly, patients who perceive a greater benefit of the test may weigh its burden differently and consequently report less burden. BE patients potentially have more to gain from early discovery of adenocarcinoma than NS patients, who are usually referred for endoscopy to detect potential explanations for their symptoms, and also more than CA patients for whom endoscopy and ultrasonography are only part of the procedure to determine their treatment options and prognosis. As we did not measure perceived expected benefit of the endoscopy we are not able to determine whether this mechanism is part of the explanation.
Thirdly, the endoscopic procedure was slightly different for the different patient groups. CA patients received sedation more often. Adjusting for this difference into the analysis did not explain the differences in pain and overall burden, whereas the difference in reported discomfort became significant after adjustment for sedation. These results suggest that differences in the proportions of patients receiving sedation during endoscopy did not explain the differences between the groups, and that sedation was provided to those patients who really needed it. The procedure for CA patients also differed; they underwent upper GI endoscopy combined with ultrasonography, and for the combined procedure an endoscope with a slightly larger diameter is used. Our data did not allow us to test separately whether this affected perceived pain and overall burden. Finally, most CA patients had esophageal carcinoma, and this disease may make passing the endoscope through the esophagus more difficult and therefore more painful.
16
], this may be debated for the reason that lower distress levels afterwards may also result from a reassurance effect of patients receiving a negative test result (no serious disease present). Nevertheless, the fact that the specific distress (IES) score relating to the endoscopy was higher than the IES score relating to the test outcome led us to conclude that the prospect of undergoing upper GI endoscopy does indeed increase distress levels.
19
]. General population scores are not available for procedure specific-distress (IES), as this can only be measured in patients. Considering the cut-off values for clinical scores, the prospect of endoscopy causes moderate distress.
The observation that patients under regular endoscopic surveillance may adapt to this invasive procedure should not result in an underestimation of the burden of regular endoscopic surveillance. The search for less invasive surveillance tests should continue, and frequency of surveillance should preferably be established by evidence-based individualized estimates of risk of progression.
