Background
To date, many of the methods for information extraction of biological information from scientific articles are restricted to the abstract of the article. However, full text articles in electronic version, which offer larger sources of data, are currently available. Several questions arise as to whether the effort of scanning full text articles is worthy, or whether the information that can be extracted from the different sections of an article can be relevant.

Results
In this work we addressed those questions showing that the keyword content of the different sections of a standard scientific article (abstract, introduction, methods, results, and discussion) is very heterogeneous.

Conclusions
Although the abstract contains the best ratio of keywords per total of words, other sections of the article may be a better source of biologically relevant data.

]). In the context of information extraction in molecular biology it is usually understood that the information to be extracted from an article are words regarding biological concepts that could synthesize the main points of the article (keywords). Therefore the Abstract of a paper is a good target for information extraction because by definition an abstract synthesizes the content of the article. Moreover, abstracts are available in public databases. However, nowadays most journals are also available in electronic version, and thus full text articles can be used for information extraction.
It is obvious that the full text of an article contains more information than its Abstract. However, in approaching full text analysis several problems must be tackled. On the one hand, the storage of full text articles requires more disk space and the analysis needs more computational capacity. On the other hand, an Abstract, as a summary, contains a high frequency of relevant terms (keywords), but this may not be the case of the rest of the article.
Other questions regard the quality of the information carried by different sections of an article. First of all, is the information in full text organized enough so that keywords can be extracted? Secondly, different biological concepts (for example, gene and protein names, tissue names, organisms, experimental conditions, etc.) may be located in different parts of the article. Or it could be that a word has a different meaning depending on the section where it is located (the word has a context dependent meaning). For example, regarding gene names, those found in the Methods section may refer mostly to analytical tools rather than being relevant to the biological phenomenology described in the whole article. In summary, it would be good to quantify and qualify the information in a full text article before embarking in large scale extraction of particular items of information.
With this goal in mind, we analyzed in this work the kind of information that is attached to different parts of an article and we tried to quantify how much information can be found in each section of an article. This should help to state some guidelines for researchers attempting to extract particular keywords (words synthesizing the content of the article) from full text articles.

). In order to derive keywords from the section of an article, we first compute the associations between the words in the section. Here, we take the sentence as the unit of text to look for associations, that is, two words are associated in the context of a section if they co-occur repeatedly in sentences within that section (see METHODS).

>= 0.3). Obviously, a more accurate comparison to MeSH terms would require the detection of bigrams, and trigrams (keywords composed of multiple words), but this is out the scope of our work. The recall when matching the original MeSH terms (6.80 on average) went down from 4.91 / 6.80 = 0.72 in the dictionary of 470.6 different nouns present in an article to 2.22 / 6.80 = 0.33 in the 66.6 keywords selected. However, since the size of the list of all nouns found in an article (470.6) is much larger than the number of keywords (66.6), the precision in matching the MeSH terms of an article increased from 4.91 / 470.6 = 0.010 to 2.22 / 66.6 = 0.033.

This justifies data mining strategies that focus in the analysis of Abstracts in order to minimize computational resources. However, this result already indicates that not all keywords are in the Abstract, and that therefore mining the rest of the article may be worthy.

). This is probably due to the fact that the Results section deals with the protocols used, although not as explicitly as the Methods section. The Discussion focuses again on the biological results (stressing their relation to the current knowledge) without detailing the techniques that have already been explained in Methods and justified in Results.

This result indicates that each section contains certain keywords that are unique to the section. In the following we try to characterize what are the differences in content between sections.

Qualitative Analysis of Subjects per Section
To make a deeper analysis of the kind of information present in each of the sections, we classified in seven categories a set of words present in our corpus of 104 articles (among the most frequent nouns). In order to do so as unambiguously as possible, we selected words that matched MeSH descriptors also consisting on that single word and belonging to only one major MeSH category (see METHODS). We added another category not present in MeSH, that of "Units, Dimensions, & Parts" in order to account for many terms that are currently not MeSH terms but are of interest to us.

Discussion

]).
In this work we have shown that the distribution of information (as keywords) in full text articles is heterogeneous and that there is certain correspondence of article sections with different kind and density of relevant data. The Abstracts are shown as the best repository from the point of view of having many keywords in a short space, justifying previous information extraction approaches. The lack of large repositories of full text articles in contrast to the current eleven million of references (many of them with their abstract) in the MEDLINE database, are another advantage of the Abstract approach.
However, we have shown that there is much more relevant information (at least in a ratio of 1:4 regarding gene names, anatomical terms, organism names, etc.) in the rest of the article. We have demonstrated that the information is structured enough to get important numbers of relevant keywords, but that for certain words (such as gene names) caution has to be taken regarding the context of the word.
We propose that the text mining of full text articles should be approached with different strategies for different sections. Beyond the Abstract, the Introduction looks like the best place to look for protein and gene names (and interactions) since it is probably describing current knowledge. The Discussion section, that interprets the results and put them in context with the current knowledge, looks like the third best place for mining such information, with Methods probably as the worst place. The Results section could be problematic given its mixed nature between Methods and the rest.
Regarding other subjects, such as keywords about biological concepts (species, tissues, diseases, etc.), again the Abstract and then the Introduction section look like the best sections to mine regarding frequency of such keywords, but Results and especially Discussion seem better from a quantitative point of view. The Methods section is clearly appropriated for looking for technical data, measurements, and chemicals. Respect to chemicals, again, their context can be completely different in this section compared to the rest.

Conclusions
Extraction of biological information from full text looks promising, but context must be regarded. Part of this context is given by the situation of the text under analysis within the article. Therefore, tuning the extraction of information to the section is probably a good strategy, and for particular tasks some sections should be avoided.

) could ultimately make text mining a children's game. We hope for future interfaces for writers of Molecular Biology articles that should do the job upon validation by the authors (for example, marking every occurrence of a gene name with a unique and stable link to any of the existing gene sequence databases). For this to happen, the collaboration between both scientists and publishers will be very important.

occurs. This is an asymmetric relation very appropriate to model hierarchical relations between words as they happen in natural text. For example, in some Cell Biology context, the word "cycle" could appear always related to the word "cell" (as in "cell cycle"), but the word "cell" can be related to many other words such as in "cell growth", "cell membrane", or "cell nucleus". Accordingly, the inclusion value of the word "cycle" into "cell" will be close to one and the inclusion value of the word "cell" into the word "cycle" will be close to zero.

 for descriptions) were selected as belonging to those classes. In order to avoid possible miss-annotations, words matching more than one category were discarded. Manual analysis of the resulting table of associations was carried out in order to check the associations and to make new ones. A new class not present in MeSH (the X class of "Units, Dimensions, & Parts") was generated in order to include a large number of terms mainly present in the Methods section.


Authors' Contributions
PS carried out the analysis of the keyword distribution from a database of full text articles. CP developed and applied the method to compute keywords. MA prepared the figures (except fig 2 by PS) and conceptualised the structure of the paper. PB and MA co-directed the project and contributed to the final manuscript. All authors collaborated during the whole length of the project. All authors read and approved the final manuscript.
