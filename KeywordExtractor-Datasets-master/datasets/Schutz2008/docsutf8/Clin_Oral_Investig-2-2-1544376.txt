)] implants was performed in both the mandible and tibia of dogs. After 4 weeks of healing, the percentage of direct bone to implant contact (BIC) and the induced bone density (BD) at a distance of less than and greater than 1 mm adjacent to each implant was assessed. Histomorphometric analysis of implants inserted in the mandible and tibia revealed that BIC values appeared to be highest in the BMP-B group, followed by BMP-A, CSA, and C. BD as measured at a distance of <1 mm revealed obvious differences between groups: BMP-B>BMP-A>CSA>C. However, no differences between groups were observed at a distance of >1 mm. Within the limits of the present study, it may be concluded that rhBMP-2 immobilized by covalent and noncovalent methods on CSA-treated implant surfaces seemed to be stable and promoted direct bone apposition in a concentration-dependant manner.

]. However, there are currently no histological data evaluating osseointegration of CSA-modified and rhBMP-2-biocoated titanium implants.
Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate histomorphometrically bone formation to CSA-enhanced and rhBMP-2-biocoated titanium implants after implantation in the mandibula and tibia of dogs in comparison to control titanium implants.

Materials and methods
Animals
Two 3-year-old male mongrel dogs (approximate weight 25 kg) were used in the study. Both animals exhibited a fully erupted, healthy, permanent dentition. During the experiment, the dogs were fed ad libitum with soft-food diet and water. Animal selection, management, and surgery protocol were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Belgrade University (ref. no. 2179). The experimental segment of the study started after an adaptation period of 4 weeks.

Study design
The study was performed in two surgical phases. In the first phase, extraction of the mandibular second, third, and fourth premolar and first molar (P2–M1) was performed bilaterally. After 4 months of healing, surgical implantation of rhBMP-2-biocoated and rhBMP-2-noncoated screw-typed implants was performed in a submerged healing procedure during the second phase. Throughout the study period, oral hygiene procedures were performed three times a week including tooth and implant brushing. Radiographs were obtained before and immediately after tooth extraction as well as immediately after implant installation. Both animals were killed after a healing period of 4 weeks.

Surgical procedure for both phases
The dogs were anesthetized with 1 mg/kg sodium pentobarbital. To maintain hydration, both animals received a constant rate infusion of lactated Ringer’s solution while being anesthetized. Prophylactic antibiotics were administrated intraoperatively with a combination of 20,000 IU penicillin and 1.0 g streptomycin/10 kg body weight. In the first surgery, P2–M1 were carefully removed after reflection of full thickness mucoperiosteal flaps and tooth separation. After wound closure by means of mattress sutures, the sites were allowed to heal for 4 months. In the second surgery, the test and control implants were randomly allocated to both sides of the mandible (left and right sides, one implant each) and one implant each to either the posterior left or right tibia. In brief, bilateral vestibular incisions were made, and full thickness mucoperiosteal flaps were elevated to expose the respective sites for implant placement in the mandible. Surgical implant sites were prepared bilaterally, at a distance of 10 mm apart, according to the protocol suggested by the manufacturer. All implants in the mandible were sealed with cover screws (Camlog, Wimsheim, Germany). After irrigation, mucoperiosteal flaps were repositioned, and primary wound closure was achieved with consecutive polyglycolic acid 5.0 Polyester sutures (Resorba, Nürnberg, Germany). An area of approximately 15 cm in length and 4 cm in width was depilated on the respective side of the tibia using an electric shaver and a razor blade. After disinfection with polyvidone iodine (Betaisodona, Mundipharma, Limburg/Lahn, Germany), a skin incision was made and a flap was elevated to expose the respective sites of the tibia for implant placement. On the inner-posterior side of the tibias, implants were inserted at a distance of 30 mm apart. All titanium implants were inserted with good primary stability according to a low-trauma surgical technique under copious irrigation with sterile 0.9% physiological saline. After implant placement, the periosteum and fascia were sutured using 3.0 Polyester sutures (Resorba, Nürnberg, Germany).

]. Indeed, the results of the present study have shown that BIC and BD values seemed to be ameliorated after application of rhBMP-2 at far lower concentrations. Furthermore, it must also be noted that the effects of rhBMP-2 were limited to a range of 1 mm, outlining that both covalent and noncovalent methods of immobilization seemed to be stable. This finding may also be supported by the observation that no differences with respect to BIC values were observed in crestal and apical areas of the implant surface in all groups. In accordance, it might be hypothesized that from a clinical point of view, both methods of immobilization are suitable to avoid ectopic bone formation due to a limited and targeted release of rhBMP-2 from the implant surface. However, further studies are needed to clarify this issue.
Within the limits of the present study, it may be concluded that rhBMP-2 immobilized by covalent and noncovalent methods on CSA-treated implant surfaces seemed to be stable and promoted direct bone apposition in a concentration-dependent manner.
