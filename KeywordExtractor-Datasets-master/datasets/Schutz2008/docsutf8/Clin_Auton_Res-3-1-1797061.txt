Sympathetic vasoconstrictor pathways pass through paravertebral ganglia carrying ongoing and reflex activity arising within the central nervous system to their vascular targets. The pattern of reflex activity is selective for particular vascular beds and appropriate for the physiological outcome (vasoconstriction or vasodilation). The preganglionic signals are distributed to most postganglionic neurones in ganglia via synapses that are always suprathreshold for action potential initiation (like skeletal neuromuscular junctions).
Most postganglionic neurones receive only one of these “strong” inputs, other preganglionic connections being ineffective. Pre- and postganglionic neurones discharge normally at frequencies of 0.5–1 Hz and maximally in short bursts at <10 Hz. Animal experiments have revealed unexpected changes in these pathways following spinal cord injury. (1) After destruction of preganglionic neurones or axons, surviving terminals in ganglia sprout and rapidly re-establish strong connections, probably even to inappropriate postganglionic neurones. This could explain aberrant reflexes after spinal cord injury. (2) Cutaneous (tail) and splanchnic (mesenteric) arteries taken from below a spinal transection show dramatically enhanced responses in vitro to norepinephrine released from perivascular nerves. However the mechanisms that are modified differ between the two vessels, being mostly postjunctional in the tail artery and mostly prejunctional in the mesenteric artery. The changes are mimicked when postganglionic neurones are silenced by removal of their preganglionic input. Whether or not other arteries are also hyperresponsive to reflex activation, these observations suggest that the greatest contribution to raised peripheral resistance in autonomic dysreflexia follows the modifications of neurovascular transmission.

Introduction

]. The sympathetic outflow arises in the thoracolumbar cord, where it is particularly vulnerable to spinal cord injuries, being damaged directly if the lesion involves regions between T1 and L3 or the ventral roots at these levels, and being disconnected from the higher control centres by injuries to descending pathways in the cervical cord. The degree of disordered visceral and vascular function that ensues depends on the level and the severity of trauma in each individual.

]. Many visceral vasoconstrictor neurones also lie in the paravertebral chain and send their axons to the viscera via the various splanchnic nerves. The properties of these pathways supplying the vasculature and their modification after spinal cord injury (SCI) are the main topics of this review.

], the redundancy of many of these contacts means that the functional autonomic equivalent to the motor unit is much smaller (only ∼15 in rat, perhaps >100 in humans).

]. Such episodes are usually relieved by removal of the stimulus but, if the trigger is unknown, treatment with vasodilators requires hospitalisation which is inconvenient and expensive. Other symptoms of dysreflexia are excessive sweating and muscle spasms. Dysreflexia is typically seen only if the lesion is at or above T5-6.

], probably due to the release of neurotrophins by inflammatory cells in the segments around the lesion site. However, as mentioned above, sympathetic discharge following brief stimuli in spinally-injured people is not particularly large or prolonged, suggesting that the expansion of afferent connections is not responsible for much enhancement of discharge. Thus the mechanisms underlying the pronounced vasoconstriction during AD have been unclear.

Overall, the data so far suggest that blood vessels in spinalized animals would constrict more powerfully to even short bursts of sympathetic activity evoked reflexly below the lesion. As well as being consistent with the complaints of many spinally-injured people about cold feet and legs, and the common difficulties in healing pressure sores, this modified vascular reactivity could contribute strongly to the development of autonomic dysreflexia in humans.

Conclusions
Despite many years of investigation, we still know remarkably little about the way in which neurally-released transmitters, including NE, lead to constriction of vascular smooth muscle. It is now clear that, as for many autonomically-innervated tissues, the mechanisms are not the same as those activated by exogenous transmitters. The work discussed here emphasizes the diversity of mechanisms that underlie the neural control of arterial vessels in different vascular beds and the plasticity of both innervation and effector tissues after lesions to the nervous system. Marked changes can occur even when both pre- and postganglionic components of the sympathetic innervation are undamaged. While the findings in experimental animals need to be confirmed in spinally injured people, they may help us to devise better ways to improve their rehabilitation and long-term maintenance. In addition, we may need to revise our thinking about the role of sympathetic activity in the regulation of the cellular processes involved in neurovascular transmission, even in intact individuals.
