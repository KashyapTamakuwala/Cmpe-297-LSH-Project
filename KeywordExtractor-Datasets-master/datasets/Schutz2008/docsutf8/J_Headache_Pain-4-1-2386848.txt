Pediatric migraine is a disabling condition, which can cause a significant impact on quality of life. Currently, no drugs have been approved by the FDA for its preventive treatment. Our aim was to review the medical literature concerning the efficacy and tolerability of topiramate in the prophylactic treatment of migraine in children and adolescents. A total of five papers were reviewed: two randomized controlled trials (RCTs), a post-hoc subset analysis of adolescents who had been included in three RCTs carried out on adults and two open studies. Topiramate has been proven to reduce headache frequency and the accompanying disability. The frequency of side effects varied considerably among studies, the most frequent being weight loss, anorexia, abdominal pain, difficulties in concentrating, sedation and paresthesia. Since these adverse events, although often transitory, may be distressing for the child, we strongly recommend to assess the disability caused by the migraine episodes before deciding to initiate a prophylactic treatment. Nevertheless, dropout rates due to side effects in the studies were very low.

]. The assessment of migraine disability is particularly important in children to correctly evaluate and treat migraine.
Currently, no drugs have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the preventive treatment of pediatric migraine. Topiramate is an antiepileptic drug, which has been approved by the FDA in the United States and in many other countries for the preventive treatment of migraine in adults and for the treatment of partial-onset seizures and primary generalized tonic–clonic seizures as add-on therapy in children as young as 2 years. Our aim was to review the medical literature concerning the efficacy and tolerability of topiramate in the prophylactic treatment of migraine in children and adolescents.

Table 1
AAN classification of evidence for therapeutic intervention

Class I: Prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial with masked outcome assessment, in a representative population.

The following are required:

 (a) Primary outcome(s) is/are clearly defined

 (b) Exclusion/inclusion criteria are clearly defined

 (c) Adequate accounting for drop-outs and crossovers with numbers sufficiently low to have minimal potential for bias

 (d) Relevant baseline characteristics are presented and substantially equivalent among treatment groups or there is appropriate statistical adjustment for differences

Class II: Prospective matched group cohort study in a representative population with masked outcome assessment that meets (a)–(d) above OR a RCT in a representative population that lacks one criteria (a)–(d).

Class III: All other controlled trials (including well-defined natural history controls or patients serving as own controls) in a representative population, where outcome is independently assessed, or independently derived by objective outcome measurement.

Class IV: Evidence from uncontrolled studies, case series, case reports, or expert opinion.






Results
We found two RCTs, a post-hoc subset analysis of 51 adolescents (12–17 years) who had been enrolled in three pivotal RCTs of topiramate for migraine prophylaxis in adults and two open studies.

 = 0.002). Side effects were rated mild to moderate, did not interfere with daily activities or cause any dropouts and included weight-loss (mean loss of 0.3 kg) in 81% of patients, paresthesia (23.8%), loss of appetite (23.8%), lack of concentration (19%), sedation (19%) and abdominal pain (14.3%). This seems a well-performed trial in which the mean monthly migraine frequency reduction is clearly evident in the topiramate-treated group. Patients treated with topiramate suffered at least five episodes a month before entering the study (range 5–30); a preventive treatment was, thus, clearly indicated. The reduction in the PedMIDAS score indicates that the drug side effects (difficulties in concentrating, sedation) interfered with school, household or social activities to a lesser extent than the migraine episodes.

], probably because migraine frequency at baseline was lower (range 2–9 in the ITT topiramate population) and children with chronic migraine were excluded. An important aspect is that the reduction is more evident in the last 28 days of treatment, indicating that it may take a few weeks before treatment with topiramate reaches its maximum efficacy.

The most common adverse events (in the group treated with 100 mg a day) were as follows: paresthesia (38%), upper respiratory tract infections (23%), weight decrease (15%), abdominal pain (15%), anorexia (8%) and somnolence (8%). There were no dropouts in the group treated with topiramate. The incidence of adverse events was higher in the group treated with topiramate at the dosage of 200 mg, which did not appear to confer additional efficacy as opposed to the dosage of 100 mg a day.

 < 0.001) at the first follow-up visit, with 43.1% of the patients experiencing a 50% or greater reduction in the number of headaches. By the second follow-up visit, headache frequency had decreased to 9.4 ± 8.4, with 56.1% of the patients experiencing a 50% or greater reduction in the number of headaches. Mean headache severity, duration and accompanying disability were also reduced. Disability was measured using the PedMIDAS score: a 50% reduction occurred in 48.6% of the patients at the first follow-up visit and in 62.5% of patients at the second follow-up visit. One quarter of patients complained of side effects, which declined in subsequent visits and included cognitive changes (12.5%), weight loss (5.6%) and sensory symptoms (2.8%). A possible bias of this study is that 50.7% of patients were on additional prophylactic medication (most often amitriptyline or divalproex).

], topiramate was administered to 24 children with migraine, who had failed to respond to other prophylactics, at the mean dosage of 3.5 ± 1.7 mg/kg for 4 months. Authors report a reduction in the duration and in the intensity of headaches; headache frequency reduction, however, did not reach statistical significance. Adverse events (emotional instability, paresthesia, anorexia, asthenia, weight loss) were experienced by one-third of patients. In our opinion, the baseline headache frequency (3.6 ± 2.7 a month with a range of 1–12) and duration (2–6 h) did not necessarily constitute an indication for prophylactic treatment in all treated cases.
Unfortunately, the studies we reviewed were not homogeneous with regard to inclusion and exclusion criteria and with regard to outcome measures such as the “responder rate,” which was not considered in all studies. Furthermore, the degree of disability caused by the migraine episodes, which is essential in the decision to initiate prophylactic treatment, was not assessed in all studies.

].
Taken together, data from the papers we reviewed suggest that topiramate is effective in the preventive treatment of pediatric migraine. Furthermore, topiramate dosages, which seem to be effective in the treatment of migraine in children and adolescents (2–3 mg/kg/day) are much lower than those indicated for the adjunctive treatment of epilepsy (5–9 mg/kg/day) in children as young as 2 years.

Side effects tended to decline over time and dropout rates due to side effects were very low (range 0–6.3%). Since these adverse events, although often transitory, may be clinically significant and distressing both for the child and its family, the decision to initiate treatment must be carefully weighed and should take the degree of disability caused by the migraine episodes into account.

In conclusion, topiramate seems to be a promising therapeutic option, though, clearly, further controlled trials are needed to confirm this data, as are studies comparing different drugs.
