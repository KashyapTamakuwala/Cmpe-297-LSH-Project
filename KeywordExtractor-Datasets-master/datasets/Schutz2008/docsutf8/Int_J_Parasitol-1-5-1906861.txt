Abstract
Plasmodium falciparum
P. falciparum
 erythrocyte membrane protein-1 (PfEMP-1)-mediated adhesion but critically dependent on cell–cell contact. Further changes included increases in IL8 release and soluble TNF receptor shedding. Microarray analysis of HUVEC transcriptome following co-culture, using a human Affymetrix microarray chip, showed significant differential regulation of genes which defined gene ontologies such as cell communication, cell adhesion, signal transduction and immune response. Our data demonstrate that endothelial cells have the ability to mobilise immune and pro-adhesive responses when exposed to both PRBC and TNF. In addition, there is also a previously un-described positive regulation by RBC and TNF and a concurrent negative regulation of a range of genes involved in inflammation and cell-death, by PRBC and TNF. We propose that the balance between positive and negative regulation demonstrated in our study will determine endothelial pathology during a malaria infection.

), and also cytokine-driven modulation of endothelial cell metabolism, but that this is usually a small, transient effect in vivo.
One question is the mechanism underpinning the accumulation of PRBC leading to micro-vascular occlusion as seen in post mortem cerebral malaria (CM) brain tissue, which is believed to be a progressive phenomenon of PRBC sequestration. We suggest that the initial sequestration of PRBC, if maintained for a prolonged period of time, has the ability to activate the endothelium to promote sequestration, leading to deleterious effects on the host. Our studies investigate the direct effects on the endothelium of PRBC retention for prolonged periods of time.

Our results have led us to propose a novel mechanism for the modulation of the endothelium during malaria infection that is dependent on low level TNF and involves a pro-inflammatory component but also a concurrent down-modulation of RBC-induced inflammation due to the presence of the parasite within the infected cell.

). All reagents were obtained from Sigma, UK. Human serum was isolated from whole blood obtained from the Royal Liverpool Hospital and was approved by the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine Ethical Committee.

2.2
Endothelial cells
Pooled human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were obtained from Promocell (Heidelberg, Germany), HUVEC from different batches were used for each experiment, at passages three to five. HUVEC were grown to confluence on 1% gelatin (Sigma, UK) coated flasks and plates. All co-culture experiments were performed in serum-depleted basal HUVEC medium (quiescing medium) which consisted of M199 (Invitrogen, UK) containing 1% FCS. These conditions were designed to increase the signal window, while maintaining the integrity of the HUVEC monolayer (i.e. there was no indication of cell apoptosis or necrosis during the experiments).

) was used (10 ng/ml) to stimulate the HUVEC, while medium alone served as a negative control. All parasite and EC cultures were regularly monitored for mycoplasma using the Takara PCR mycoplasma detection kit (Cambrex Biosciences).

2.3
PRBC-EC co-culture conditions

 at 37 °C. The RBC suspension was adjusted to 1% haematocrit. PRBC at the trophozoite stage (20–28 h post-invasion) were used in all co-culture studies; for the functional studies the parasites were synchronised using sorbitol, while for the microarray studies the trophozoites were additionally enriched using plasmagel flotation. In selected experiments, the parasites were retrieved after the 20-h, stained with giemsa and examined by light microscopy. There was no apparent rupture of RBC or change in the parasite stage over this period. For all functional studies the PRBCs were at a parasitaemia of 3% and co-cultured with HUVEC for 20 h. For microarray studies, the PRBCs were enriched on Plasmagel to parasitaemia ranging between 50% and 60% and co-cultured for 6 h. The uninfected RBCs were from the same batches used for parasite culture and were maintained under the same conditions as PRBCs, in separate flasks.

2.4
RNA expression: microarray analysis
Following incubation, the supernatant was aspirated, HUVEC was washed with cold RPMI-1640 and then with 0.02 M EDTA to remove the adherent RBCs and the cells harvested using Trizol (Invitrogen, UK). RNA integrity was evaluated by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel and by spectrophotometry using the absorbance ratio at 260/280 nm.

 for 3 min to remove any RBCs and stored at −80 °C.
The HUVECs were washed once with cold RPMI-1640 and then with 0.02 M EDTA to remove the adherent RBCs and subsequently harvested by trypsinisation for analysis by flow cytometry. FACS ICAM-1 expression on HUVEC was determined by staining the cells using a fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated mouse anti-human ICAM-1 antibody (MCA1615F; Serotec) using standard staining protocols and the cells fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde and analysed by flow cytometry. ICAM-1 expression was expressed as geometric mean of the fluorescence intensity.

2.6
IL-8 and TNF receptor expression
The supernatants stored from the co-culture studies were analysed using a standard sandwich ELISA kit (IDS), using a horse-radish peroxidise based colorimetric detection system, to quantify IL8 released from ECs. IL8 production was expressed as a concentration in pg per ml.
Similarly, soluble TNFR I, sTNFR I (p55) and soluble TNFR II, sTNFR II (p75), were detected using sTNFR I (KAC1761) and sTNFR II (KAC1771) ELISA kits (Biosource). TNFR level was expressed as TNFR concentration in ng per ml.
In order to understand the kinetics of TNFR expression on the surface of ECs in response to co-culture with PRBCs, the ECs were co-cultured with PRBCs and uninfected RBCs for 0.5, 1, 2 and 3 h. Following the incubation period, HUVECs were harvested and dual stained for surface TNFRs with monoclonal anti-human RII-FITC (FAB226F) and monoclonal anti-human RI-PE (FAB226F) antibodies (R&D Systems Europe). The receptor expression was expressed as the geometric mean of the fluorescence intensity.

2.7
Trypsin digestion of RBC

). After incubation the trypsin was inhibited with FCS at a final concentration of 10%. Conditions for trypsinisation were optimised to prevent cell lysis and the cells were stained with giemsa before and after trypsinisation to confirm RBC integrity was maintained. The RBCs were washed three times in PBS and resuspended in M199 supplemented with 1% FCS and co-cultured with HUVEC, as described.

), under laminar flow conditions at shear stress of 0.05 Pa, before and after trypsinisation, in order to evaluate PfEMP-1 mediated cytoadhesion.

2.8
Transwell experiments
Confluent HUVECs were co-cultured with PRBCs separated using a 0.4 μm transwell filter (Falcon), which prevents contact between HUVECs and RBCs but allows soluble factors to diffuse through. This set-up allowed us to determine whether contact between RBCs and ECs was necessary for induction of ICAM-1 expression on the ECs.

This could be a result of serum depletion when complete medium was replaced with M199/1% FCS for the duration of the co-culture experiment. In the case of both receptors, the observed down-regulation in response to RBCs was significantly greater than that seen under basal conditions.

A wide range of GO terms were over-represented in each cluster within categories of biological process, cellular component and molecular function, with a number of common and parallel themes, including cell communication, signal transduction, cell adhesion, organismal physiological process, ion transport, response to external stimuli and immune response. Interestingly, the genes in each of these clusters were primarily cell membrane-associated, or related to the extracellular region and the extracellular matrix. The molecular functions of the genes in each cluster were wide ranging, although receptor activity, signal transducer activity, ion channel and protein binding activities were parallel themes in all three clusters.

Thus, our data does not suggest induction of apoptosis; in fact, there appears to be a trend towards protection from apoptosis and this was supported by our inability to detect any positive staining with annexin V and the absence of any morphological changes in the ECs after co-culture.

, significant regulation of the EC transcriptome was induced. Analysis of the transcriptome revealed a wide diversity of gene ontologies representing genes that were significantly regulated, however, care must be taken in interpreting the data since there is a high degree of redundancy across GO terms, which was not accounted for in this analysis. IL8, for instance, has diverse biological roles including cell communication, cell adhesion, signal transduction and immune response. In spite of such deficiencies, the GO terms that were over-represented, including cell communication, cell adhesion, signal transduction, ion transport and immune response, fit well with our hypothesis that the infected RBC is able to modulate the host endothelial response.

b), which may represent a parasite-specific adaptive response that favours parasite survival and development by protecting the integrity of the host endothelium. Up-regulation of these genes under the same conditions may result in the induction of a pro-adhesive effect that can potentially feed back to reinforce pathological sequestration that is typically seen in the later stages of severe malaria. In addition, induction of an immune response, as in cluster 3, may confer a protective effect on the host. Thus, we propose that the balance between these converse effects of PRBCs and TNF on the endothelium may be the critical factor in determining the response by endothelium and the clinical outcome of a malaria infection in vivo.

). This is a potential mechanism to induce expression of genes to counteract the response to PRBCs and may reflect a partially protective host response during a malaria infection, balanced against inducing a pro-adhesive environment, particularly early in infection when systemic inflammation is unlikely to be a major contributor to pathogenesis.
Lucchi et al., 2006
Yipp et al., 2003
). While co-culture models give useful insights into mechanisms of action of PRBCs on host cells in malaria pathogenesis, care must be taken in the interpretation and extrapolation of this data to pathogenesis in vivo, since these mechanisms may not be reflected in the in vivo situation.

). Our suggestion is that the host response to sequestration is complex and involves a balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory pathways, both mediated by apposition of the PRBC, and interacting with other mechanisms of host response to malaria infection variably throughout an infection. This balance is critical to the health of an EC and the resulting pathology associated with severe malaria.
