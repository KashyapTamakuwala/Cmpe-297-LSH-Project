Background
Cereals naturally contain a great variety of polyphenols, which exert a wide range of physiological effects both in vitro and in vivo. Many of their protective effects, including an improvement of the function and redox state of immune cells in unhealthy or aged subjects come from their properties as powerful antioxidant compounds. However, whether cereal-based dietary supplementation positively affects the immune function and cellular redox state of healthy subjects remains unclear.

Aim of the study
To investigate the effects of supplementation (20% wt/wt) for 5 weeks with four different cereal fractions on healthy mice.

Methods
p
p
-coumaric acid, ferulic acid, quercetin, catechin, rutin and oryzanol as major polyphenols.

Results
In general, all cereal fractions caused an improvement of the leukocyte parameters studied such as chemotaxis capacity, microbicidal activity, lymphoproliferative response to mitogens, interleukin-2 (IL-2) and tumor necrosis factor (TNFα) release, as well as oxidized glutathione (GSSG), GSSG/GSH ratio, catalase (CAT) activity and lipid oxidative damage. We observed similar effects among the cereal fractions.

Conclusions
The results suggest that some of these effects may due, at least partially, to the antioxidant activity of the polyphenols naturally present in cereals. Since an appropriate function of the leukocytes has been proposed as marker of the health state, a short-term intake of cereals seems to be sufficient to exert a benefit in the health of the general population. However, further studies are needed to assess the optimal doses and to find out which active polyphenols are able to mediate the observed physiological effects before recommending their regular consumption.

Since there is an increasing interest in consuming products naturally rich in phytochemicals able to provide health benefits and prevent a wide variety of diseases, in this context we have investigated in the present work the effects of diet supplementation for 5 weeks with different types of cereal fractions naturally rich in polyphenols on certain parameters of immune function and redox state of peritoneal leukocytes from adult healthy mice.

Material and methods
Animals
Mus musculus
) (Harlan Ibérica, Barcelona, Spain), which were 24 weeks old on arrival to our laboratory, were used. Mice were checked periodically by animal care personnel and were specific pathogen free, as tested by Harlan according to FELASA recommendations, and did not show any sign of malignancy or other pathological processes. The animals were randomly housed in polyurethane boxes, at a constant temperature (22 ± 2°C) in sterile conditions inside an aseptic air negative-pressure environmental cabinet (Flufrance, Cachan, France), on a 12/12 h reversed light/dark cycle. All animals were fed water and standard Sander Mus (A04 diet from Panlab L.S., Barcelona, Spain) pellets ad libitum. The diet was in accordance with the recommendations of the American Institute of Nutrition for laboratory animals. Mice were treated according to the guidelines of the European Community Council Directives 86/6091 EEC. Although we have previously observed that the oestrous cycle phase of mice has no effect on this experimental assay, all females used in the present work were at the beginning of dioestrous.

Experimental groups
n
 = 30) and four supplemented (30 mice per group), were used. The supplementation started at 28 weeks of age. Then, the supplemented groups were fed for a period of 5 weeks, and at the age of 33 ± 2 weeks samples were obtained to evaluate certain parameters of function and redox state of peritoneal leukocytes. The experiments were carried out in January at a constant laboratory temperature of 25 ± 2°C. Food intake was measured weekly at the same time (9:00–11:00 h). Each animal was fed weekly 50 g of diet (control or supplemented) and, after 1 week, the uneaten remains were weighed. Body weights were determined once every week. No significant differences on food consumption and body weight among diet groups during the study were observed.

]. The same authors demonstrated that, in the presence of catechin, ascorbic acid at pH 3.0 works in a sinergystic way preventing lipid oxidative damage and β-carotene cooxidation. This fact might explain the central role that consuming natural products rich in polyphenolic antioxidants, like cereals, has in promoting health and preventing the onset of chronic diseases.

]. Finally, we consider the present nutritional intervention in animals as preventive, but not therapeutic, since it is able to maintain the normal functional and redox status of the body cells from a general population of mice. Therefore, we do not deliver a cereal-based antioxidant supplement to unhealthy subjects, i.e., in conditions caused by excessive free radicals generation. In conclusion, we strongly believe that polyphenols naturally present in cereals may have important implications for health preservation, by acting, al least partly, as modulators of immune function and redox state. Although we emphasize the importance of further studies on this subject, we suggest the use of this type of supplementation for the general population since “prevention is a much more effective approach that treatment of disease”.
