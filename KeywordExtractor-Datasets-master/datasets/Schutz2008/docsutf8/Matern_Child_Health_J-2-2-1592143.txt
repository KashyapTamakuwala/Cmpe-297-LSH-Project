Social marketing approaches can help to shape the formation of and to create demand for preconception care services. This article describes four components of social marketing, often referred to as the 4 P’s, that should be carefully researched and set in place before a national effort to launch and sustain preconception care services is pursued. First, the product or package of services must be defined and adapted using the latest in scientific and health care standards and must be based on consumer needs and desires. Second, the pricing of the services in financial or opportunity costs must be acceptable to the consumer, insurers, and health care service providers. Third, the promotion of benefits must be carefully crafted to reach and appeal to both consumers and providers. Fourth, the placement and availability of services in the marketplace must be researched and planned. With the application of market research practices that incorporate health behavior theories in their exploration of each component, consumer demand for preconception care can be generated, and providers can take preconception care to the market with confidence.

Viewing health care services as a business, and using language such as “marketing” and “sales,” may be uncomfortable to some who prefer to view the process of having a baby as a natural, emotional and deeply personal part of the human experience. However, the notion of providing preconception care as a service could very well benefit from a well-conceived and constructed social marketing research plan and execution that acknowledges and embraces the emotions of the patient and her partner. Thus, thinking about developing a social marketing plan to support preconceptional health care could help to ensure that babies are born with the best start in life.

). Advocates of preconception care can learn important lessons from the UBC preservation business marketing executives who market, sell and provide services to a similar audience.

) identified a number of product attributes including relative advantage (is the product better than what it will replace?), compatibility (does the product fit with the intended audience?), complexity (is the product easy to use?), trialability (can the product be “tried out” before making a decision to purchase it?), and observability (are the results of the product visible and measurable?). Program planners can position their products effectively in the marketplace if they maximize their product’s appeal by addressing these important product attributes.

) which addresses the interaction between personal, environmental, and behavioral factors is commonly used to understand many facets of a person’s expectations of outcomes from performing a behavior, environmental contexts (helps and hindrances) related to the behavior, experiences in performing the behavior (positive or negative), and efficacy (ability/confidence) in performing the behavior. These are just a few of the ways in which the pricing can build on the positive product attributes developed in the first step. It also helps that the outcome—a healthy pregnancy and baby—is a highly valued and very tangible benefit for those who want it.
The pricing for a health care organization is more complicated. Cost-effectiveness studies and business case studies need to document how the organization’s PCC service costs compare with treatment of preventable health conditions. Balancing financial overhead and time pressures in these times of managed care may be a real challenge—and particularly so for reaching women who may have unplanned pregnancies. The greatest challenge may be weighing the intangible costs and benefits against the financial costs: How much preconceptional folic acid counseling is worth a child being born without a lifelong disability like spina bifida? How many smoking cessation sessions balance out the costs of a premature/low birth weight baby who might spend his first months of life in the NICU? How many fewer patients might a health care professional have time to see and bill for when pregnancy counseling they do for people with genetic conditions takes up more time? And what additional patient education messages, addressing chronic or acute health issues, are not being delivered during a regular well visit because the health care professional’s time is being used discussing preconception health issues? The health care provider medical office may well not be the best and/or most efficient way to market preconception care services to consumers in many cases. The practicing physician may also not be the first or best person to deliver the preconception care message. The goal of a good pricing strategy is to find an effective and innovative way to reach the target market while reducing the costs to both the health care delivery system and the consumer.

What action must be taken by each audience (e.g., product, behavior, or policy)

What does PCC services need to look and feel like for consumers to want/use/demand them?
What does PCC services need to look and feel like for busy health care providers to want to offer them?
What does PCC services need to look and feel like for health insurers to want to cover this service?

Pricing –
Why would they want to do it?

What is the value of PCC services and what would they be willing to pay for them?
What is the value for offering PCC services to patients and what would it cost to offer them?
What is the return on investment for including PCC services as a covered service?

Promotion –
How will each audience be told about the what, why, where, and how?

How will PCC services be publicized and made available to consumers in a way that they are attractive, affordable, and accessible?
How will PCC services be presented to health care providers so that they are willing and able to offer them?
How will PCC services be presented to insurers so that they are willing and able to reimburse for them?

Place –
Where can they do the action needed?

What settings/locations are most acceptable, appropriate, and accessible for providing PCC services?
What settings/locations are most acceptable, appropriate, and accessible for offering PCC services?
What forums or conferences can instigate productive discussions about including PCC services as a covered expense?
