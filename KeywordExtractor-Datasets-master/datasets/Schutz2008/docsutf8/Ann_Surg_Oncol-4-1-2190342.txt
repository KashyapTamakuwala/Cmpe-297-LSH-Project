Background
The present phase II study aimed to assess the feasibility and efficacy of a new paclitaxel-based neoadjuvant chemoradiation regimen followed by surgery in patients with stage II–III esophageal cancer.

Methods
From January 2002 to November 2004, 50 patients with a potentially resectable stage II–III esophageal cancer received chemotherapy with paclitaxel, carboplatin, and 5-FU in combination with radiotherapy 45 Gy in 25 fractions. Surgery followed 6–8 weeks after completion of neoadjuvant treatment.

 = 3).
Pathologic complete tumor regression was achieved in 18 of 47 operated patients (38%). R0 resection was achieved in 45 of 47 operated patients (96%). There were four postoperative deaths (8.5). Postoperative complications were comparable with other studies. After a median follow-up of 41.5 months (21–59) estimated 3- and 5-year survival on an intention-to-treat basis was 56 and 48%. Estimated 3-year survival in responders was 61%, in nonresponders 33%.

Conclusion
This novel neoadjuvant chemoradiation regimen for treatment of patients with stage II–III esophageal cancer is feasible. Results are encouraging with a high pathologic complete tumor regression and R0 resection rate and an acceptable morbidity and mortality. Preliminary survival data are very promising.

PATIENTS AND METHODS
Patients
Referral to our institute was accomplished as a result of agreements between hospitals affiliated to the Comprehensive Cancer Centre South in the Netherlands to concentrate surgical care of patients with esophageal cancer. The protocol of this prospective clinical phase II trial was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee, and from all patients written informed consent was obtained. All consecutive patients with a potentially resectable stage II and III esophageal cancer who were referred to our Centre between January 2002 and November 2004 were found eligible.

/L, creatinine level < 120 μmol/L and/or creatinine clearance > 60 mL/min, and normal hepatic enzyme levels. Patients with distant metastatic disease or tumor positive supraclavicular lymph nodes were excluded from entry into the protocol. However, M1a disease in the regional lymph nodes was not.
Pretreatment staging evaluation included clinical examination, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy with histological biopsies of the tumor, computed tomography (CT) scan of chest and upper abdomen, and ultrasound of the neck. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) was performed when a T1 tumor could not be excluded by conventional techniques. More recently, PET imaging was introduced to exclude distant metastases.

Neoadjuvant Treatment

 continuous infusion on day 1–42. All patients were treated prophylactic with dexamethasone 20 mg and a 5HT3 antagonist IV followed by ranitidine 50 mg IV and clemastine 2 mg IV.
Radiotherapy was performed with a linear accelerator with a minimal photon energy of 6 MV. The total dose of 45 Gy was given in 25 fractions of 1.8 Gy once daily, starting on day 1. The radiation fields encompassed the primary tumor and enlarged lymph nodes, if any, defined by endoscopy, CT scan, and EUS, surrounded by 5-cm proximal and distal margins and a 2-cm radial margin. Neoadjuvant treatment was given on a fully outpatient base.

Surgery
Surgery was planned 6–8 weeks after completion of neoadjuvant treatment. For tumors in the distal third of the esophagus, a transhiatal approach was used whenever possible. A thransthoracic Ivor-Lewis technique was used for tumors in the proximal and middle third of the esophagus. Esophagogastric continuity was reestablished using the stomach with a cervical anastomosis in all patients. A feeding jejunostomy was placed, and enteral feeding was started 24 hours after surgery.

Data Collection
The following data were prospectively collected: age, sex, WHO performance status, location of the tumor, histology of the tumor, comorbidity, toxicity of neoadjuvant treatment, type of resection, and postoperative course and complications.

Histological Examination

Toxicity Related to Neoadjuvant Treatment
Forty-two patients (84%) completed full neoadjuvant treatment. Three patients discontinued chemotherapy prematurely due to grade II hand-foot syndrome, four patients due to esophagitis, and one due to grade IV leucopenia. Forty-seven patients (94%) received at least 5 weeks chemotherapy; the remaining three patients discontinued chemotherapy in week 4. Full dose of radiotherapy was received by 49 patients (98%). Grade III leucopenia occurred in 23 patients (46%), without febrile episodes. No other hematologic toxicity was recorded. All 50 patients experienced esophagitis, usually mild (≤ grade 2). A total of 13 patients (26%) needed nasogastric enteral feeding. Infection of the indwelling central venous catheter occurred in two patients. There were no neoadjuvant treatment related deaths. However, one patient died of myocardial infarction 3 weeks after completing neoadjuvant treatment.

Postoperative Complications
Surgery was performed after a median of 8.1 weeks (range 6.0–17.9 weeks). No significant difference was observed between responders (TRG 1–3) and nonresponders (TRG 4–5) with respect to the time between the end of chemoradiation and surgery. Two patients showed metastatic disease at the time of surgery; hence, 47 patients underwent surgery with a curative intention. Transhiatal esophageal resection was performed in 44 patients; a transthoracic Ivor-Lewis resection was performed in three patients.

Recurrent disease was found in 20 patients surviving postoperatively (20 of 43, 47%) Five of them were still alive at the time of the analysis. Recurrence was only locoregional in three patients. Distant metastases occurred in 16 patients, and in one patient recurrence presented with locoregional and pulmonary metastases.
To date 22 patients have died. Of these 22 patients, three died from nondisease-related causes and were presumed disease free. Of the 19 patients who had disease-related deaths, four patients died of postoperative complications, and three patients died of complications from local recurrence, whereas 12 patients died due to systemic failure that included metastases to lung, liver, brain, and bone.


DISCUSSION
6
 A reduction of the dose of chemotherapy components of this regimen resulted in a decrease of toxicity with preservation of its high efficacy rate. The pathologic complete tumor regression rate of 38.3% and R0 resection rate of 95.7 % are among the highest described in the literature. Toxicity and morbidity of this regimen compared with the original scheme were mild and acceptable.

However, a careful interpretation of these results is warranted, because this meta-analysis was based on summarized patient data.

 and carboplatin AUC 5.0 instead of AUC 6.0. This modification resulted in a reduction of toxicity. Forty-two patients (84%) received full doses of the planned 6 weeks chemotherapy, whereas in the group of Meluch et al. only 54% of patients received full dose chemotherapy. A relative large proportion of the patients (26%) received preoperative nasogastric enteral feeding. This was partly due to our liberal use of nasogastric enteral feeding, since in our experience optimizing preoperative nutritional status in patients treated with a neoadjuvant chemoradiaton protocol is critical. The neoadjuvant treatment was delivered on a fully outpatient basis. Further improvement of our regimen may be obtained by replacing 5-FU for novel oral fluoropyrimidines. In colorectal cancer, the novel fluoropyrimidines such as capecitabine and UFT show equal if not superior efficacy and improved patient convenience.

 A relatively short interval between completion of neoadjuvant therapy and surgery of 2–4 weeks is noted in these trials and might be of influence in the relative high mortality rates described in these trials.
We decided to perform surgery after at least 6 weeks to achieve an adequate downstaging and permit maximal recovery; in addition, surgery was postponed in some patients due to a slow recovery from the chemoradiation. We believe that the timing of surgery is important. Performing an esophagectomy too soon after neoadjuvant chemoradiation may lead to increased morbidity due to prolonged myelosuppression and hence an increased risk for developing postoperative complications.

 In the present study a major response, tumor regression grade 1–3, resulted in a significant increase in overall and disease-free survival. Since the time between surgery and the end of the chemoradiation did not significantly differ between the responders and nonresponders, a difference in response could not be explained by a lag-time difference. Thus, a regimen with high complete pathologic response and R0-resection rates will be very likely to improve survival. However, with our relatively short follow-up we cannot report definitive long-term survival data yet.
In conclusion, although the discussion regarding the value of neoadjuvant therapy is ongoing, the neoadjuvant treatment regimens used for the last 20 years produced only modest benefit, at best. Improving chemoradiation regimens as in our study, by incorporating modern chemotherapeutics such as paclitaxel in combination with modern 3-D conformal radiotherapy seems to be promising. Further improvement of the systemic therapy seems to be critical as survival is mainly determined by recurrences at metastatic sites. Data of ongoing phase III trials including novel chemoradiation protocols have to be awaited in the near future.
