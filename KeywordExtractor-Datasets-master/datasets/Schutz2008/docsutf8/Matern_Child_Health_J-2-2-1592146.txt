The increasing prevalence of overweight and obesity among women of childbearing age is a growing public health concern in the United States. The average body mass index (BMI) is increasing among all age categories and women enter pregnancy at higher weights. Women are also more likely to retain gestational weight with each pregnancy. Women who are overweight (BMI 25–30) and obese (BMI ≥30) are at greater risk of adverse reproductive health outcomes compared to women of normal weight status (BMI 19.8–25). This article provides an overview of the complications associated with maternal overweight and obesity including diabetes, pre-eclampsia, c-sections, and birth defects. We present updated information on the weight trends among women. Finally, we present an overview of the prevention studies aimed at adolescents and women prior to pregnancy.

The purpose of this paper is to describe an overview of the complications associated with maternal overweight and obesity; present updated information on the weight trends among women; and review prevention studies aimed at adolescents and women prior to pregnancy.

Our knowledge of how and why this disease develops is far from complete, but currently funded research projects are targeting the integration of social, behavioral, cultural, and biological factors. In addition, best practices at obesity prevention, treatment and optimal weight maintenance must be identified to provide practitioners with an array of strategies to help curb the ensuing epidemic.
