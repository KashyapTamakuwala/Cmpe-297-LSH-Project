In previous studies, we described subclinical abnormalities of neuromuscular transmission and cerebellar functions in migraineurs. The aim of this study was to search if these two functions are correlated in the same patient. Thirteen migraineurs [five without aura (MO) and eight with aura (MA)] underwent both stimulation-SFEMG and 3D-movement analysis. Single fiber EMG (SFEMG) results were expressed as the “mean value of consecutive differences” (mean MCD). Precision of arm-reaching movements (measured with an infrared optoelectronic tracking system) was expressed as the average deviation in the horizontal plane. Median values of mean MCD and mean horizontal deviation were not different between MO and MA. However, in MA, but not in MO, both variables were positively correlated. Thus, we conclude that neuromuscular transmission and cerebellar functions are correlated in the same patient when affected by migraine with aura. We suggest that this correlation might be due to a common molecular abnormality.

]. It was suggested that these two abnormalities might reflect the same underlying genetic abnormality. If this is correct, one may expect that in the same individual they be of a similar degree. We have therefore compared in the same migraine patient the SFEMG and 3D-movement analysis.

Materials and methods
Patients

] were recruited from the Headache Clinic of the Headache Research Unit in Liège, Belgium. Eight patients suffering from typical aura with migraine headache (MTA–ICHD-II code 1.2.1; three women and five men; median age 28.5 years; range 13–67) and five patients with migraine without aura (MO–ICHD-II code 1.1; three women and two men; median age 40.0 years; range 31–51) underwent both stimulation-SFEMG and 3D-movement analysis. All patients were right-handed. None of them had any other medical condition detectable by history and clinical examination; none was taking drugs on a regular basis, nor had taken any drug within 3 days before the recordings. The recordings took place at least 3 days after and before an attack (checked by telephone-interview).
The study was conducted after approval of our Institution’s ethics committee and performed in accordance with the ethical standards of the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki, with the understanding and consent of each involved subject.

 test. The Spearman rank order correlation test was used to compare the values of the mean MCD on SFEMG and the mean horizontal deviation on 3D-movement analysis.


Results
On SFEMG, the median value for mean MCD was not significantly different between MO (16.05 μs; range 9.50–22.93) and MTA (18.91 μs; range 11.50–24.55). The median value of mean horizontal deviation was 4.01 mm (range −3.25 to 18.12) in MO and 10.74 mm (range 1.60–17.03) in MTA, a nonsignificant difference.

Discussion
Our within-patient analysis shows that, in migraine with aura, the mean MCD on SFEMG increases significantly with the degree of horizontal deviation in a visually guided reaching movement. This suggests that, in subgroups of migraine patients, neuromuscular transmission (NMT) performance and control of ballistic movements by the lateral cerebellum are similarly influenced by a common biochemical and/or neural mechanism.

In conclusion, the correlation between NMJ and cerebellar performances that we have found in migraine with aura patients might be due to a common genetically determined molecular mechanism, possibly influencing ion channels functions, but this has still to be proven by appropriate genetic studies.
