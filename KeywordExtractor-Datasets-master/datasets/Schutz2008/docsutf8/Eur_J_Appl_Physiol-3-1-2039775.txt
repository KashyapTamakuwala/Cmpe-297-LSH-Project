Behaviour of motor unit potential (MUP) velocities in relation to (low) force and duration was investigated in biceps brachii muscle using a surface electrode array. Short static tests of 3.8 s (41 subjects) and prolonged dynamic tests (prolonged tests) of 4 min (30 subjects) were performed as position tasks, applying forces up to 20% of maximal voluntary contraction (MVC). Four variables, derived from the inter-peak latency technique, were used to describe changes in the surface electromyography signal: the mean muscle fibre conduction velocity (CV), the proportion between slow and fast MUPs expressed as the within-subject skewness of MUP velocities, the within-subject standard deviation of MUP velocities [SD-peak velocity (PV)], and the amount of MUPs per second (peak frequency = PF). In short static tests and the initial phase of prolonged tests, larger forces induced an increase of the CV and PF, accompanied with the shift of MUP velocities towards higher values, whereas the SD-PV did not change. During the first 1.5–2 min of the prolonged lower force levels tests (unloaded, and loaded 5 and 10% MVC) the CV and SD-PV slightly decreased and the MUP velocities shifted towards lower values; then the three variables stabilized. The PF values did not change in these tests. However, during the prolonged higher force (20% MVC) test, the CV decreased and MUP velocities shifted towards lower values without stabilization, while the SD-PV broadened and the PF decreased progressively. It is argued that these combined results reflect changes in both neural regulatory strategies and muscle membrane state.

), the IPL method is unable to distinguish and follow individual MUPs belonging to the specific MUs. 
In the present study, the sEMG signal was described with four parameters derived from the IPL method: (1) the mean muscle CV which was the average of the obtained MUP velocities; the two statistical distribution variables, which were: (2) the within-subject MUP velocities’ skewness [Sk-peak velocity (PV)] and (3) the within-subject MUP velocities’ standard deviation (SD-PV), and (4) the peak frequency (PF), a variable expressing the amount of MUP activity (number of peaks = MUPs) per second.

 were performed in order to show the (early) changes on force, without any influence of movements on the signal.

Methods
Subjects
The study involved short static and prolonged dynamic experiments. Forty-one healthy and physically active males (24.8 ± 6.7 years, from 17 to 48) (mean ± SD) volunteered for the first experiment and 30 randomly chosen subjects from that group (25.4 ± 7.6 years, from 18 to 42) participated in both experiments. Exclusion criteria were drug abuse and the practice of bodybuilding. Three from a total of 44 subjects were excluded because of the impossibility to obtain a required correlation coefficient between the sEMG signals used to estimate the parameters’ values. The experimental protocol was conducted according to the Helsinki Declaration and approved by the local ethics committee. All participants gave written informed consent.

).
During the experiment subjects were sitting in a chair. The upper arm was slightly abducted and comfortably supported at 45° of the shoulder flexion, the forearm was free. When the elbow was stretched, the line of the upper arm-forearm was at 45° in relation to horizontal. When the elbow was flexed to the angle of 135°, the forearm was horizontal. The forearm was supinated during static and dynamic tests.
Static tests
Subjects were asked to hold the forearm horizontally (elbow angle was then 135°). A visual bar helped to maintain the correct (horizontal) position of the forearm. In the loaded tests a sack filled with lead and sand was placed in the palm. Three levels of force were applied in blocks that were 3 min apart: unloaded, loaded 10 and 20% MVC. A block consisted of three tests (three repetitions at the same level of force); every test lasted for 3.8 s and was within a block separated 30 s from one another.

Dynamic tests
All participants of the dynamic tests underwent previously static tests, separated by 5 min. Subjects were asked to swing the forearm from the stretched (elbow angle 180°) to horizontal position (elbow angle 135°), thus moving over an angle of 45°. They did it within a rate of 40 beats per minute (one up-and-down movement in one beat), given by a metronome sound. The visual bar indicated the horizontal position to which the lower arm returned after being stretched. Four force levels were applied: unloaded, and loaded 5, 10 and 20% MVC. The tests lasted for 4 min and were separated by 5 min.

 > 0.7). The ground electrode was placed on the lateral upper arm, slightly proximal from the derivation electrode. The temperature sensor was medial on the upper arm. Two obtained signals were differentially amplified (gain 2,000–10,000×) and band pass filtered at 2–250 Hz by EMG apparatus (Viking IV, US).

Data processing
The signals were simultaneously A/D converted (sampling 10 kHz, 12 bits acquisition). Data were stored on a personal computer. The signal was analyzed with LabVIEW 6.1 that also facilitated a partial on-line analysis. The peak selection and the correlation coefficient assessments for both static and dynamic tests were performed on 0.2 s epochs. In the static tests, measurements were taken every second during 0.8 s (comprising 4 epochs of 0.2 s). A static test was of 3.8 s duration and was repeated three times for each force level. The statistical analyses were performed on the data of these three repeated tests taken together. In the dynamic tests, the data were assembled every 30 s during 14.4 s (comprising 72 epochs of 0.2 s). The test duration was 4 min.

Peak selection

). The software was custom designed and written in LabView. The orientation of the signals is up-negative. 1st step: finding zero line. 2nd step: finding the peak-to-peak amplitude of the largest MUP in an epoch of 0.2 s. 3d step: finding a peak-decline structure. The peak-decline is defined as a structure with a decline of ≥20% compared with the largest MUP amplitude of a 0.2 epoch, over ≤4 ms (≤40 sample points). 3d step: finding a peak. A peak is the highest (most negative) point previous to the decline, and must be ≥10 μV (the threshold of the noise level). 4th step: finding a pair peak. A pair peak is a peak in the second signal with the properties as previous, found in a time window between 1.49 and 4 ms after the peak of the first signal. This window is chosen assuming the physiological CV values of 2.5–6.67 m/s. 5th step: excluding double peak. If a peak from the first signal matches two different peaks from the second signal, then the first peak from the second signal is true. If during the fatiguing tests the CV severely diminishes, then the low limit of velocity is put at 1.3 m/s, making a window of 1.49–7.68 ms. As an objective pragmatic criterion to this change a lowering of the peak frequency with ≤30% was assumed, as compared with the first value of the 20% MVC test.


The parameters
The following calculations were performed: (1) basic calculation of PV, following the IPL method; (2) mean CV, expressed as an average value of the PVs; (3) within-subject skewness of the peak velocities (Sk-PV), expressed as a skewness of a PVs’ population of a subject; (4) within-subject standard deviation of the peak velocities (SD-PV), expressed as a standard deviation of a PVs’ population of a subject; and (5) peak frequency (PF), expressed as a number of peaks per second.

During the unloaded, and loaded 5 and 10% MVC tests, slower peaks are moderately increasing and faster peaks are diminishing. During the 20% MVC test, the peak velocities shift considerably as a whole towards lower regions, and the amount of peaks visibly diminishes

Taken together, in the initial phase of activity, the proportion of fast peaks increased with increasing force. In the prolonged tests loaded up to 10% MVC, the proportion of fast peaks declined again over the first 2 min and then stabilized at about the level of the unloaded test. During the 20% MVC test, however, the proportion of fast peaks still tended to decline up to the end of the test, accompanied with a growing amount of slow peaks.

For those who were able to complete the test, the PF continued to decline up to the end, with exception of one subject in whom the PF increased instead. At 240th s the PF of the continuing subjects was reduced by −35 (−78 to +3)%.



Discussion
Changes in the distribution of MUP velocities as an effect of (low) force and duration were described with four parameters: (1) the global parameter of mean CV, (2) the within subject skewness of a population of MUP velocities; (3) the within-subject standard deviation of MUP velocities and (4) the amount of MUP activity, expressed as MUP frequency. First we will comment on the four parameters. Next, using these parameters, we will discuss the main findings.

), obtained with the inter-peak latency method.
Skewness is used as an sEMG parameter in the present study for the first time. This statistical measure of deviation from a normal distribution, in this case expresses the proportion between slower and faster MUPs within an individual. It will increase with the growing proportion of slow/tonic/fatigue resistant MUs and will decrease with the augmenting proportion of fast/phasic/fatigable MUs. All the estimates were moderately positively skewed, which indicates a relative excess of lower MUP velocities.

). Thus, for the two tasks different types of motor units (with different velocities) may be activated.
In short, increases of mean CV with increasing forces in the initial phase of muscle activity may be a result of both recruitment of fast/phasic motor units and faster membrane propagation.

). The evolution of the standard deviation parameter, with its narrowing followed by stabilizing, fits in with the idea that the rate coding may temporarily increase and consecutively adapt, resulting in a new balance.
The MUP frequency variable, expressing the amount of MU activity produced as a result of recruitment and rate coding did not change during these tests. This suggests that all the changes in recruitment and rate coding do not, in principle, affect the total amount of MU activity. 
All subjects were able to complete the tests, and the sEMG parameters became stable in the course of time as well. Thus, one can assume that the three tests at lowest force levels were non-fatiguing. Taken together, the results of these apparently non-fatiguing dynamic position tasks suggest that following the initially increased activation of fast MUs, the proportion shifts after about 2 min in favour of slower MUs. The amount of activity seems to remain stable throughout the duration of the tests.

). The non-linear decline pattern of MUP frequency, first slow and later on steep, suggests successively exhausting available MUs’ reserves, resulting in lower firing frequencies and failing recruitment. Accordingly, many subjects reported fatigue and stopped exercising. 
In short, during these apparently fatiguing dynamic position tasks, a global slowing of MUP velocities appears, suggesting a fatigued muscle membrane. The amount of MU activity seems to diminish progressively and finally the recruitment stops.

), so it was chosen for assessments at 90°.
In conclusion, we present a set of parameters derived from the interpeak latency method, which yields information about changes in MUP velocities’ distribution and amount of MUP activity. Skewness, standard deviation and peak frequency parameters appear to corroborate the results of a global muscle conduction velocity. Together they could contribute to quantifying the dynamics of motor unit activity and membrane fatigue. The interconnected results may be useful in ergonomics (for assessment of fatigue) and in sports (for eliciting specific capabilities, such as explosive or endurance capabilities).
