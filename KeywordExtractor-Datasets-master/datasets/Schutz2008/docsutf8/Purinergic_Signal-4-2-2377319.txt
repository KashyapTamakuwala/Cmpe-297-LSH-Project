The common theme of this introductory article and the minireviews that follow in this special issue is the concept of microenvironments within tissues and surrounding cells that would be ideal signaling venues for a biologically active purinergic ligand. Collectively, the editors/authors and the other contributing authors agree that nucleotides and nucleosides would be most potent within a confined system. A talented cadre of purinergics has been solicited to discuss purinergic signaling in his or her favorite microenvironment within a given organ or tissue. We are gratified by the large number of original articles that also have successfully navigated the peer review process and are part of this special issue. These concepts are not simply purinergic, but the idea of maximal potency in a tissue microenvironment and surrounding specialized cells within a tissue pertains to any autacoid or paracrine agonist.

Introduction
Dictyostelium discoideum
, is cyclic adenosine monophosphate (AMP). Receptors for cyclic nucleotides have only been defined until now in the lower biological systems. Receptors for cyclic nucleotides as well as inosine or thymidine may also exist on mammalian cells and receive this autocrine signal within a microenvironment.

]. In this microenvironment, glandular and acinar secretions may convey the purinergic ligands so that they may act in an autocrine manner at the acinus or in a paracrine manner within the duct. However, it is an open system in that these secretions eventually exit this tissue environment. The airway submucosal gland beneath the airway surface epithelium may be one such example that conveys purinergic signals to the surface where they may drive ciliary beat and other functions. The pancreatic acinus and duct, the sweat gland and duct, and the bile secretory apparatus and the bile duct are all important examples.

 entry signal triggers the fusion or exocytosis of ATP-filled synaptic vesicles so that labile ATP is secreted into the synaptic cleft. Extracellular ATP-gated P2X receptor channels on the postsynaptic membrane have a large extracellular domain poised to bind that ATP immediately upon release within a synaptic microenvironment where there is a short diffusion distance and a small volume. In other words, the synapse is an ideal microenvironment for paracrine purinergic signaling. In this paradigm, the ATP is likely degraded to adenosine diphosphate (ADP), 5′ AMP and adenosine, where adenosine may be recycled back into the presynapse by nucleoside transporters only to be a substrate to synthesize new ATP for metabolism or neurotransmission.

]. How may ATP affect responses to glutamate at glutamate, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), and kainate receptor channels in the postsynaptic membrane and/or at the presynapse in terms of release of ligand? Many possible cotransmitter effects have also been entertained and studied. We do not wish to debate the relative roles of P2X receptor channels in neurotransmission. The possible explanations of ATP effects at an excitatory glutamatergic synapse are given in simplistic terms. We only wish to show the synapse as a lead microenvironment to illustrate how and why local ATP signaling may be important.

Conclusions and future directions

Purinergic Signalling
 focusing on the “Physiology of Nucleotide Release” is dedicated to these and other pioneers who would not give up the fight. All purinergics would agree that we owe the purinergic pioneers a great debt. Through their efforts, establishment of this journal, and the increasing volume of research in purinergic signaling, it is now accepted that ATP and its metabolites have two principal biological roles—as an extracellular signaling ligand and as an intracellular fuel.


Work by EMS on purinergic signaling has been supported by past awards, DK54367 and HL63934, and is currently supported by DK67343. The PI also wishes to acknowledge the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, the Polycystic Kidney Disease Research Foundation, and the American Heart Association for past support on the study of the “Physiology of Nucleotide Release.” EMS is also a participant in the Gregory Fleming James Cystic Fibrosis Research Center, the Recessive PKD Translational and Research Core Centers, the Comprehensive Kidney Disease Research Center, and the Comprehensive Diabetes Center at UAB. Work by JGF has been long supported by NIH NIDDK R37 DK046082-14 and DK043278-18.
