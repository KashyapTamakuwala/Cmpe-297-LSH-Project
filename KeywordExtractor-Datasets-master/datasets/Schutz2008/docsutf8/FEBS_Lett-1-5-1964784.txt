Abstract
The GTPase RhoA is essential for the development of pre-T cells in the thymus. To investigate the mechanisms used by RhoA to control thymocyte development we have used Affymetrix gene profiling to identify RhoA regulated genes in T cell progenitors. The data show that RhoA plays a specific and essential role in pre-T cells because it is required for the expression of transcription factors of the Egr-1 and AP-1 families that have critical functions in thymocyte development. Loss of RhoA function in T cell progenitors causes a developmental block that pheno-copies the consequence of losing pre-TCR expression in Recombinase gene 2 (Rag2) null mice. Transcriptional profiling reveals both common and unique gene targets for RhoA and the pre-TCR indicating that RhoA participates in the pre-TCR induced transcriptional program but also mediates pre-TCR independent gene transcription.

 but transcriptional targets for RhoA signal transduction in primary non-transformed cells have not been explored. The present data show that RhoA regulates expression of genes encoding members of the Fos/Jun and early growth response (Egr) family of transcription factors but also has an impact on expression of genes regulating diverse biological functions including serine/threonine kinases, protein phosphatases, enzymes that regulate protein biosynthesis and proteins that regulate nuclear structure and function.

 double negative thymocyte subsets were analysed for CD44 and CD25 expression following lineage exclusion of mature DP and SP cells as well as non-T cell lineage cells using a cocktail of biotinylated antibodies (CD4, CD8, CD3 B220, Mac-1, NK, Gr-1, and γδ) revealed with streptavidin-tricolour and costained with CD25-FITC, CD44-PE and Thy1.2-APC. Intracellular phospho-S6 and TCR-β intracellular staining was carried out on thymocytes pre stained to identify DN3 and DN4 subpopulations. Cells were subsequently fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature, washed in PBS and permeabilized with saponin buffer (0.5% saponin, 5% FBS, 10 mM HEPES [pH 7.4] in PBS) for 10 min at room temperature. Permeabilized cells were incubated with PE-conjugated TCRβ antibody and phospho S6 antibody for 45 min at room temperature, washed in saponin buffer and subsequently stained with FITC conjugated donkey anti rabbit IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove PA). Cells were analysed on an LSR Flow Cytometer (BDIS).

. Accordingly, it is possible to isolate DN3 thymocytes ex vivo that have only just switched on expression of C3 transferase and prepare RNA for DNA microarray analysis. The Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 array, representing 39 000 murine gene transcripts, was used to transcriptionally profile DN3 pre-T cells purified from the thymi of CD3–C3 transgenic mice. In these experiments DN3 thymocytes from wild type control mice were transcriptionally profiled and used for comparisons.

. There were approximately 18 000 genes expressed in wild type DN3 thymocytes: loss of RhoA function caused a ⩾2-fold decrease in expression of 383 genes and a ⩾2-fold increase in expression of 190 genes. RhoA regulated genes in DN3 thymocytes encode proteins with diverse biological functions including serine/threonine kinases, protein phosphatases, enzymes that regulate protein biosynthesis.

. In CD2–C3 DN3s there were also high levels of phosphoS6 in TCR-β high cells. The presence of normal S6 phosphorylation in β selected DN3s lacking Rho function is a further indication that Rho is necessary for a subset of responses in DN3 thymocytes but does not globally block signalling.

. This comprehensive loss of AP-1 activity in pre-T cell lacking RhoA function plus the decreased expression of other transcription factors would rapidly cause global changes in the transcriptional program of a cell. Moreover, the transcription factor defects would be exacerbated by the decreased expression of chromatin modifying enzymes such as SATB1.

 null mice block T cell development at a common stage. The present data show that the genetic consequences of loss of Rho function versus loss of pre-TCR expression for T cell progenitors are not identical. The present results also show that loss of Rho function in pre-T cells results in downregulation of genes encoding members of the Fos/Jun and Early growth response (Egr) family of transcription factors. The collective loss of these transcription factors and the resultant secondary genetic changes explains why loss of RhoA function prevents pre-T cell development.

 DN3s (lacking TCR-β signalling). The region of overlap regulates genes that are commonly regulated. Gene changes 2-fold and above are shown.

Endogenous RhoA function is not required for pre-TCR induced phosphorylation of S6. FACS histograms shows intracellular TCR-β staining profiles (left panel) for wild type and CD2–C3 DN3 cells and subsequent levels of phospho-S6 (right panel) in TCR-β low or high DN3 cells.
