. All repellents and inhibitors used were dissolved in this buffer. Compounds that were insoluble in aqueous solutions were first dissolved in a small quantity of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and then diluted 1:1,000 or more into the buffer and vortexed vigorously. The chemorepellent guanosine-5′-O-(3-thio)triphosphate (GTP-γ-S) was obtained from Alexis Biochemicals (San Diego, CA, USA), along with the G-protein inhibitor pertussis toxin. The tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein was obtained from Acros Organics (New Jersey, USA). Calphostin C [a protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor], diadzein a control for genistein inhibition), guanosine-5′-O- (2-thiodiphosphate) (GDP-β-S) (a G-protein inhibitor), Rp-8-Bromoguanosine-3′,5′-cyclic monophosphorothioate (Rp-8-Br-cGMPs) (a competitive inhibitor of PKG), 1-(6-(17β-3-methoxyestra-1,3,5(10)-trien-17-yl) amino)hexyl)-1H-pyrrole-2,5-dione (U73122) (a phospholipase C inhibitor), NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA), and N-(3-(Aminomethyl)benzyl)acetamidine (1400W) (NOS inhibitors), 4H-8-bromo-1,2,4-oxadiazolo(3,4-d) benz(b)(1,4)oxazin-1-one (NS2028) (a PKG inhibitor), and the Quantizyme nitric oxide (NO) assay kit were purchased from BIOMOL Research Laboratories (Plymouth Meeting, PA, USA). The polyclonal antiphosphotyrosine antibody was purchased from Upstate (Lake Placid, NY, USA); 30X Tris-buffered saline (TBS) and 30X TBS/nonidet P40 (NP40) were obtained from Modern Biology (West Lafayette, IN, USA). The guanosine 3′3;5′monophosphate (cGMP) emzyme immunosorbent assay (EIA) kit was purchased from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI, USA). Sodium metavanadate (a phosphatase inhibitor) and theophylline (a phosphodiesterase inhibitor) were obtained from Sigma Chemical (St. Louis, MO, USA). All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma as well.

, 100 mM Trizma base, pH 9.5 with hydrogen chloride (HCl). Alkaline phosphatase buffer was then removed, and blots were developed using the Sigma-Fast system until bands were visible.

EIA assays
NO assays were carried out using 2-day-old cell cultures. Cells were washed twice in buffer and diluted to a final concentration of approximately 720 cells/ml. Cells were exposed to 100 μM GTP-γ-S for approximately 30 s, then spun down in a bench-top microcentrifuge for 30 s. Control cells were spun under identical conditions except that no GTP was added to the solution. Supernatant from both sets of cells was analyzed for NO using a kit from BIOMOL according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

 cells/ml in order to maximize cGMP production. Cells were exposed to 100 μM GTP for approximately 30 s, then immediately lysed by freezing in liquid nitrogen and thawing. Theophylline (1 mM) was added to the lysate to inhibit phosphodiesterases. Lysate was spun at 16,000 g for 30 min. Control cells were treated in identical fashion except for the addition of GTP. Supernatant from both sets of cells was assayed for cGMP using a kit from Cayman Chemicals according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Immunofluorescence

]. Mucocysts were allowed to precipitate by standing the tube in a rack for 10 min. Supernatant (including cells) was removed from the top of the tube. The cells were then washed 3× in behavioral buffer to remove any remaining mucocysts or Alcian Blue and concentrated down into 3 ml total; 1 ml of cells was set aside as the control cells. Another milliliter of cells was incubated with 100 μM GTP-γ-S. A third aliquot was incubated with 100 μg/ml genistein prior to GTP treatment. Immediately, all three aliquots of cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde (from 37% stock diluted into behavioral buffer) with gentle shaking for 20 min. Cells were washed 3× in 1× TBS/NP40 (Modern Biology) then incubated with a 1:100 dilution of polyclonal antibody in 1× TBS/NP40 for 1.5 h. Cells were again washed 3× in 1× TBS/NP40 then incubated in a 1:100 dilution of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (ICN Biomedicals) for 1.5 h. Cells were washed 3× in 1× TBS before being viewed under a Nikon microscope at 400×. Cells were photographed using a SPOT digital camera using a 10-s exposure for each photograph.

d. Both GTP-treated and control cells showed similar staining at 66 kDa. However, increased phosphotyrosine levels were seen in the GTP-γ-S-treated cells at 42, 35, and 21 kDa, consistent with tyrosine kinase activity. These bands were also present in the control cell extract; however, the phosphorylation level in these lanes was so low that they were barely detectable with our staining procedure. Additional bands were also seen in both the GTP-exposed and the control lanes; however, they were also too light to be measurable. A more sensitive assay, such as chemiluminescence based Western blot detection, might help to give a more complete profile of the phosphotyrosine-containing proteins shown in this procedure.

, which allows calcium efflux from ER stores. The high cytosolic calcium interacts with some (unknown) isoform of NOS, guanylyl cyclase, and other calcium-binding proteins, ultimately resulting in ciliary reversal. Whereas some of the relationships between second messengers are still unknown, the model has been put together to stimulate thought and discussion and to make some order out of a complex pathway.

Recognizing the potential pitfalls of relying solely upon pharmacological data, we supplemented behavioral assays with other kinds of tests, such as Western blots, immunofluorescence, and EIA when available. In all cases, the additional tests confirmed the data we originally obtained using pharmacological inhibitors.
