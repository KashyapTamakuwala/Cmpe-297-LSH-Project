Introduction

]. Aldosterone is produced predominantly in the adrenal cortex and is derived from cholesterol through various steps involving a number of dehydrogenases and cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs). This includes aldosterone synthase (CYP11B2), which catalyses the final steps of aldosterone biosynthesis.

]. A model based on the structure of several known enzymes would be more accurate since every additional segment will improve similarity or spatial coordination of protein regions. However, structural flaws can be expected at locations where the template structures are joined and if these regions are within the active site, they need to be thoroughly refined.

]. The models of Belkina et al. discuss the potential spatial arrangement of the amino acids in the active site and hypothesise the hydrogen-bonding network involved in heme stabilisation. Furthermore, the effect of several amino acid mutations have been detailed. The models of Ulmschneider et al. focus on describing protein-inhibitor interactions and structure activity relations of their developed inhibitors. The so far published models were thoroughly characterised for those specific purposes, however, the goal of our model construction work was to investigate the regioselectivity of the natural ligands within the enzymes and to detail potential protein-ligand interactions.
in silico
 data are presented in the form of molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations. These methods are regularly used to investigate protein-ligand interactions. Because the only difference in the activity of the two isoforms CYP11B1 and CYP11B2 is the formation of aldosterone by the latter, successful 3D modelling of the isoforms relies on a careful analysis of the specific substrate conversion activities that exists between these two isoforms.
36
34
35
]. The study by Bottner et al. showed that mutation of three residues outside the active site (L301P, E302D, A320V) is sufficient to convert the catalytic activity of CYP11B2 into that of CYP11B1, suggesting that remote steric aspects play a more important role in the substrate binding and substrate conversion than the presence of different amino acids in the active sites of both isoforms. This led us to postulate that the difference in substrate conversion is caused by a difference in the relative positioning of the substrate above the heme in the active site. To be more specific, we postulate that there is a correlation between substrate selectivity and the substrate hydroxylation distance, the distance between the heme iron and the substrate carbon. In other words, the binding mode of the natural substrate dictates which carbon atom is oxidised first, with conversion taking place on the carbon atom which is in closest proximity to the iron-oxygen complex.

 at a correct distance for oxidation.
To substantiate this hypothesis, the three dimensional architectures of the human and rat CYP11B enzymes were constructed using comparative modelling. For reasons of relevance only the CYP11B1 and CYP11B2 isoforms were investigated. We intend to show how knowledge of these various hydroxylation patterns of aldosterone precursors can result in working models for the substrate selective activity of the two isoforms. From here on, the human isoforms will be noted as hCYP11B1 and hCYP11B2, whereas the rat isoforms will be noted as rCYP11B1 and rCYP11B2.

). Although it is possible to model this site through a deletion in the mammalian structures, the resulting active site cavity would become strained. Since the structure of CYP101 is elongated, modelling a 1 amino acid insertion and relaxing the fold will create a better definition of this active site region. Taking into account that its substrate and reduction system are similar to that of the CYP11B family, CYP101 is found to possess the best structural core for the modelling of the CYP11B isoforms.

]. Hence, when taking the helices I and K from CYP101, the other regions must be used as well. Within the topological alignment of these regions, the mammalian P450s contain insertions and deletions in the connectivity between helix C and D, which is an additional reason why we have decided to construct the CYP11B models using the CYP101 structure.

). In the CYP101 structure, this helix is positioned too high in the active site cavity, which is probably a reason why it is regularly seen as inappropriate to model on. We chose the structure of CYP2C5 where we extended its helix from a 2 turn length to a 3 turn length.

Docking of steroids was performed in the presence of an iron-bound oxygen atom and their conformations were afterwards checked to investigate alternate orientations of the steroid in the active site cavity. The protein structures used for docking the substrates were the unequilibrated structures, whereas for docking the inhibitors, the hCYP11B1 and hCYP11B2 models were used after they were equilibrated with the ligand 18-hydroxycorticosterone.

Next, cells were incubated for 1 h in serum-free medium with cumulative inhibitor concentrations, followed by addition of 500 nM (0.5 times Km) 11-deoxycorticosterone (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, USA) as substrate. Finally, V79 CYP11B1 cells were incubated for another 1 h and V79 CYP11B2 cells for another 3 h. Medium was removed and the (produced) steroids were extracted with 5 mL diethylether from 1 mL medium aliquots, mixed with 1 mL 1 M sodium-glycine buffer (pH 10.5) containing 500 nM methylprednisolone (Sigma-Aldrich) as internal standard. Extracts were dried under nitrogen and dissolved in mobile phase for automated HPLC analysis, using a stationary phase consisting of an MR column (4.6 × 50 mm, particle size 2.5 μm) and a mobile phase consisting of a mixture of 680/320/1 (v/v/v) milliQ water, acetonitrile and trifluoro-acetic acid.

For both hCYP11B1 and hCYP11B2 around 95% of the residues are positioned in the favoured and core regions of the Ramachandran Plot, indicating that for hybrid models, the structures are of acceptable quality. Due to the high quantity of alpha-helices and beta-sheets, the majority of residues is positioned in the expected regions. The residues which are situated in disallowed and unfavoured regions of the plot, are located in loop regions outside the active site. In total, 9 residues in the hCYP11B1 model are situated in the disallowed regions and 15 residues in the unfavoured regions. For the hCYP11B2 model, 10 residues are situated in disallowed regions and 14 residues in the unfavoured regions. The causes for these disparities are several insertions or deletions introduced in the models for which the structural minimisation was not sufficiently adequate to correct the backbone dihedrals. In particular, these regions are a relatively large insertion between alpha-helix D and beta-sheet 3-1, and an insertion between helix G and H.

). By comparing the results, it can be seen that the models all score equally well but are less accurate than the template structures. An Errat quality factor of 95% is expected for crystal structures resolved at a resolution of 2.5 Å. Using the Errat score per amino acid we were able to locate the deviations in the loop regions at the end of helix E where our two template structures connect and at the end of helix D where a large insertion was introduced. It is likely that in the minimisation protocol with tethered heavy atoms, the connectivity between template structures has not been fully optimised. Investigation of the amino acid environment with Verify3D resulted in similar conclusions as found with Errat and the Ramachandran data. The low scoring of Verify3D can be attributed to a bad folding of the regions around the helices D and F, and additional potential errors were located at the end of helix G, where again the two templates have been connected to each other.

This proposed method of substrate stabilisation may explain the regioselectivity of the two CYP11B isoforms and can be attributed to the subtle changes observed on two sides of the active site cavity; the cavity near helix K and the positioning of helix B′.

-etomidate was able to dock in different orientations, but favoured one particular conformation with its phenyl ring pointing into the direction of helix B′. The main flexibility observed was caused by the ethyl-ester group and the docking score of those conformations was very similar. Metyrapone was able to dock with both pyridine rings to the iron, but mainly favoured a conformation with the carbonyl facing Arg110. Since all ligands favoured only one orientation, it was this orientation that was investigated by MD.

During the first 500 ps, the RMSD increased and the protein still adapted towards its optimal conformation. After this point in time hardly any change in the three dimensional structures of the proteins was observed. The largest fluctuations of the protein were found in the flexible regions with peak values located in the structures around alpha-helix D (not shown). In the random coil following alpha-helix D we introduced a large insertion of seven amino acids, which elongates the alpha-helix by one turn before it connects to the following beta-sheet. Inside the water box, this region is found to protrude into the water without any stabilising protein interactions and unfolds due to interaction with water. In all the simulations we observed an opening of the active site and the continuous flow of water molecules in and out of the active site cavity. Several water molecules retained key positions, such as the water molecules that make up the channel towards the conserved Glu459 (not shown).

-hydroxyl with the backbones of Gly379 and Phe381, and the presence of Phe130 are also important for the stabilisation of the ligand in the protein active site. Determinant for the interaction of Arg123 is the presence of Glu310 in alpha-helix I, which stabilises Arg123 and alpha-helix B′ in the active site.

The constructed models are useful tools in trying to understand some of the molecular mechanisms involved in ligand binding and substrate conversion for the CYP11B family. As such, these models might also be appropriate tools for more detailed protein-inhibitor modelling studies as well as for ligand design or database screening, following further model optimisation and model tuning.
