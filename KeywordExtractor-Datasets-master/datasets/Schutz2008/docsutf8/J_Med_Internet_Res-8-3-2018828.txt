Background
 The Internet is a viable channel to deliver evidence-based smoking cessation treatment that has the potential to make a large population impact on reducing smoking prevalence. There is high demand for smoking cessation information and support on the Internet. Approximately 7% (10.2 million) of adult American Internet users have searched for information on quitting smoking. Little is known about these individuals, their smoking status, what type of cessation services they are seeking on the Internet, or how frequently these searches for cessation information are conducted.

Objective
The primary goal of this study was to characterize individuals who search for smoking cessation information on the Internet to determine appropriate triage and treatment strategies. The secondary goal was to estimate the incidence of searches for cessation information using publicly available search engine data.

Methods
 We recruited individuals who clicked on a link to a leading smoking cessation website (QuitNet) from within the results of a search engine query. Individuals were “intercepted” before seeing the QuitNet home page and were invited to participate in the study. Those accepting the invitation were routed to an online survey about demographics, smoking characteristics, preferences for specific cessation services, and Internet search patterns. To determine the generalizability of our sample, national datasets on search engine usage patterns, market share, and keyword rankings were examined. These datasets were then used to estimate the number of queries for smoking cessation information each year.

Results
During the 10-day study period, 2265 individuals were recruited and 29% (N = 655) responded. Of these, 59% were female and overall tended to be younger than the previously characterized general Internet population. Most (76%) respondents were current smokers; 17% had quit within the last 7 days, and 7% had quit more than 7 days ago. Slightly more than half of active smokers (53%) indicated that they were planning to quit in the next 30 days. Smokers were more likely to seek information on how to quit and on medications; former smokers were more interested in how to cope with withdrawal. All participants rated withdrawal information and individually tailored information as being more useful, while displaying little interest in telephone counseling, expert support, or peer support. Publicly available data from large search engines suggest that 4 million Americans search for resources on smoking cessation each year.

Conclusions
 This study adds to the limited data available on individuals who search for smoking cessation information on the Internet, supports the prior estimates of the size of the population, and indicates that these individuals are in appropriate stages for both active cessation interventions and aggressive relapse prevention efforts. Continued development and evaluation of online interventions is warranted, and organizations seeking to promote cessation should carefully evaluate the Internet as a possible modality for treatment and as a gateway to other traditional programs.

]; more women reported to have looked then men (10% vs 7%), and unlike other health-related information seekers, they tended to be younger. At the time, this represented approximately 10.2 million people who had ever turned to the Internet for smoking cessation–related information or services. Little is known about these individuals, including their basic demographic characteristics, smoking status (eg, current smokers seeking cessation treatment, recent quitters seeking support to maintain abstinence), readiness to quit, quitting history, and treatment preferences. With the proliferation of antismoking sentiments and restrictive smoking policies, a diverse group of individuals may be turning to the Internet for assistance. In order to provide individually tailored and effective cessation treatment services via the Internet, it is necessary to better understand the characteristics and needs of this population.

]. These individuals would be excluded from most randomized clinical trials of smoking cessation treatment, but they may represent a sizable population in need of assistance to remain abstinent. Information and services may need to be specially tailored to address the unique needs of individuals searching for cessation information based on their smoking status, demographic characteristics, and quitting history.

The primary purpose of this study was to characterize individuals who search for smoking cessation information. Specifically, we sought to gather information about sociodemographic and smoking history variables, search patterns (eg, time of day, search terms used), and perceptions about specific types of cessation services. Additionally, we used publicly available data to estimate the incidence of these searches. This information will be critical to develop appropriate and effective online cessation treatment programs, to triage patients as part of a stepped-care treatment model, or to successfully recruit smokers into treatment via the Internet.

). Those who accepted the invitation were directed to the QuitNet website following completion of the survey. Those who declined the survey invitation went directly to the QuitNet website. Recruitment for the survey was conducted for a total of 10 days: it began December 30, 2003, was suspended January 1 through January 3 due to technical concerns, and was completed January 12, 2004.
Generalizabilty was established from the complete panel of respondents, while we restricted further analysis to the respondents that reported any history of smoking and were seeking assistance for themselves.

Measures
The survey consisted of 10 questions that included basic demographic information (age, gender), reasons for searching for cessation information, current smoking status, readiness to quit, quitting history (number of past quit attempts, length of quit, quit methods used), information desired, and ratings of perceived helpfulness of various online cessation features (eg, bulletin board, assistance in setting a quit date). The survey questions were administered on three separate screens, with no more than three questions per screen. Date and time of survey completion were automatically logged to the database.
Data on utilization of QuitNet after survey administration were extracted, including registration and total time online. Time online was defined as the time between the first page view after completion of the survey through the time of the last page view.

Participant Characteristics
Table 3
, the majority of study participants were female (61.2%, n = 383) and between the ages of 26 and 44 years (62.7%, n = 393); 18.7% (n = 117) were aged 18-25 years, 17.1% (n = 107) were aged 45-64, and less than 1% were 65 or older (n = 4) or under age 18 (n = 5). Adjusted to local time of the participant, more than half (53.4%) of search engine queries for cessation information occurred during work hours (8 am-5 pm), 26.6% occurred between 5-9 pm, and 20% occurred at night (9 pm-6 am).
Participants were asked the reason they were searching for smoking cessation information. The majority of survey respondents (90.1%, n = 590) indicated that they were looking for help or support for themselves; 5.6% (n = 37) were looking for general information; 3.4% (n = 22) were looking for help for someone else; and 1% (n = 6) were health professionals or researchers looking for information. Further analyses were limited to individuals looking for cessation help or support for themselves or for general cessation information (N = 626). Among these individuals, 75.4% (n = 472) were current smokers, 17.4% (n = 109) had quit within 7 days (“recent quitters”), and 7.2% (n = 45) had quit more than 7 days ago (“longer-term quitters”).

Estimating Incidence of Cessation Queries

], this ratio yields an estimate of 3.6 million (99% CI = 2.5-4.8 million) cessation-related searches per year in the United States alone.


Discussion
The Internet holds great potential to impact population smoking prevalence by delivering evidence-based treatments to greater numbers of smokers who may never receive treatment through other modalities. This is the first study to characterize the population of individuals looking for cessation information online. Results suggest that the Internet may be an effective way to reach smokers who are younger, who search for cessation services during work hours, and who have recently quit on their own.
15
16
17
], this segment of the population of smokers received little attention once formal cessation treatments ended. Given the reach and 24/7 availability of the Internet, effective relapse prevention interventions can and should be delivered to the thousands of smokers trying to maintain abstinence. An effective relapse prevention service for self-quitters with intensive support around the quit date could produce a significant impact on smoking prevalence and could be used in conjunction with any other cessation treatment.

].
Limitations
Several limitations should be considered when interpreting results of this study. The relatively low response rate (29%) raises concern about the generalizability of findings. Survey respondents were more likely to go on to register with the site; this likely indicates that they were in a more advanced stage of change than nonrespondents. It may, however, also indicate that the survey itself acted as an incentive to proceed to registration. Furthermore, we worked from the assumption that individuals who clicked on the link to QuitNet in search engine results were representative of the entire population of searchers. Although consistent with utilization patterns of search engines, this assumption has never been tested for searches on smoking cessation, or the QuitNet site in particular. It is possible that less motivated searchers may find the query results unappealing and not click on any link at all, thus biasing our results toward individuals closer to quitting.
A second potential limitation is the method we used to estimate the total number of people seeking smoking cessation information each year. This method does not take into account searches using other keywords or individuals using resources other than search engines to find information (eg, health Web portals, referrals from health professionals, direct-to-consumer advertising, or quit lines). In addition, individuals may search for information multiple times, making it difficult to estimate the actual number of unique individuals as opposed to the total number of searches. Finally, the dataset used to derive these estimates is of commercial nature and published online in a promotional context. It has not been peer-reviewed or made available in its raw form. The data for this study were collected from 2003-2004; it is possible that in the intervening time the demographics or search behavior of smokers has changed. However, given the limited changes in both search engine technology as well as the demographics of smokers in the United States, this seems unlikely. Despite these limitations, this study provides valuable information about people who search for smoking cessation information online, and it demonstrates a new methodology for validating this kind of survey data.

Conclusion
2
20
], there is enormous potential to globally impact smoking prevalence.
The public health community has invested heavily over the past 15 years in successfully de-normalizing smoking and encouraging cessation. However, low uptake rates seen in clinical programs and telephone quit lines call for new population-based approaches. Even if Internet-assisted tobacco interventions prove to have limited efficacy, the Web may still serve as a point of entry to multi-modality treatment programs. These programs may serve to simply link online searchers to more traditional treatment programs (such as telephone counseling or local group sessions), provide pharmaceutical products, or, in more sophisticated settings, use the Web as a platform to integrate voice counseling, local groups, mailed pharmaceutical products, and other proven modalities. We anticipate that the consumer demand demonstrated in this report will ultimately drive increasing services that will reflect a mixture of these different evidence-based treatments.



Survey deployment and data collection were performed at QuitNet Inc. by Dr. Cobb with support by the company. Drs. Graham and Cobb had complete access to all raw data, and performed all analysis and writing of the manuscript.

At the time of the survey design and data collection Dr. Cobb served as an executive of QuitNet Inc. as well as holding a financial interest in the company. Dr. Graham has served as a consultant to the company in the past. At the time of submission of the manuscript, neither author had an affiliation or financial involvement with QuitNet Inc.
