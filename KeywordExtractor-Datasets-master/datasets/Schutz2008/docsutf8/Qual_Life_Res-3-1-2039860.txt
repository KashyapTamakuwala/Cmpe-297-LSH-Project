Objective
.


Methods
Descriptive study in general practices. Patients with early stage UCs who had not had elaborate diagnostic investigations were included. Demographic characteristics were compared to a Dutch general practice population. Quality of life scores were measured with the RAND-36 and compared to another Dutch general practice population and to depressed patients.

Results
Data of 466 patients were available for analysis. Mean age was 44 years and 74% were females, mostly higher educated. Of the patients, 63% presented with unexplained fatigue. On average, quality of life was poor (mean RAND-36 domain scores 37–73), also in comparison with other groups.

Conclusion
General practice patients presenting with UCs have a remarkably poor quality of life. Future research should explore how early identification of patients at risk of developing chronicity can take place. Awareness of potential poor quality of life may influence GPs' medical decision making.

]. Little is known about patients with unexplained complaints in their early stages. We performed this study to describe the demographic characteristics and quality of life of patients with early stage unexplained complaints. To provide some frame of reference, we compared these descriptive measures for the unexplained complaints to those of an unselected group of patients visiting their GP, and a group of depressed patients. For practitioners, better delineation, in terms of quality of life, of a group of patients that frequently seeks their help may sensitize them to consider more structured monitoring in order to achieve a firmer diagnosis be it somatic, psychological, or psychosocial.

Methods

]. This definition supposes that complaints are labelled “unexplained” early on in the clinical episode before elaborate investigations were performed.
Between February 2002 and December 2003, participating GPs included adult patients, presenting with a complaint that the GP designated as “unexplained” at the end of the first consultation. Patients who had presented with the same complaint in the previous 6 months were not included. Patients were eligible if they presented with fatigue, abdominal complaints, musculoskeletal complaints, weight changes or itch as their main complaint.
Individual GPs decided whether a complaint was “unexplained”. There was no standardization of this process other than that implied by the Dutch College of General Practitioners’ definition. GPs invited patients to participate in the study at the end of the consultation.

Informed consent procedure and medical ethics committees
All participating patients gave written informed consent after having read information provided by the GP directly after the consultation. The medical ethics committees of the University of Amsterdam and Maastricht University approved the study protocol.

] and is composed of 36 questions and standardized response choices, organized into eight multi-item scales (domains). These eight domains are: physical functioning (PF), role limitations due to physical health problems (RP), social functioning (SF), general mental health (MH), role limitations due to emotional problems (RE), vitality (VT), bodily pain (BP) and general health perception (GH). Raw RAND-36 scores on the eight domains are linearly converted to 0–100 scales with higher scores indicating better quality of life.

Data collection: reference populations

]. Briefly, this national survey contains data about health and healthcare-related behaviour of 375,899 persons, registered in 104 practices with 195 GPs in 2001.

Reference populations for comparison of quality of life
The results section of this manuscript shows that the quality of life of patients with early stage unexplained complaints is poor. Our initial objective was purely descriptive. However, when such low quality of life figures were found, we felt the need to compare these to other patient groups. First, we wondered whether maybe all patients consulting their GP would have such low quality of life figures and therefore compared the unexplained complaints group with a Dutch general practice population. We also thought that maybe our patient population included a lot of depressed patients which could explain the poor quality of life and therefore also compared our quality of life figures with those of a population of depressed patients.

Results
General characteristics of the study group
Of the 91 GPs who intended to participate, 18 dropped out before including any patients. They predominantly reported lack of time as the reason for drop out. Ten GPs did not include any patients during the inclusion period, although they did not formally drop out. Thus, 63 GPs (69%) included 513 patients with unexplained complaints (range: 1–36 patients per GP). Questionnaires from 466 (91%) patients were available for analysis. Forty-seven patients stopped their participation to the study or did not fill out this particular questionnaire.

Discussion
Our findings indicate that patients with early stage unexplained complaints are mainly women in their forties, with secondary or higher education levels and with an overall remarkably poor quality of life. Their quality of life in all but one domain of the RAND-36 is significantly worse than that of patients from a general practice population, even taking into account that such a population also includes (around 13% of) unexplained complaint patients. Patients with unexplained complaints predominantly score badly on physically oriented domains, compared to depressed patients, who predominantly score badly on mental/emotional oriented domains. For the remaining domains they score on a comparably low level. Therefore, practitioners may consider to pay attention to quality of life aspects of patients with early stage unexplained complaints, even though this may not always lead to a firmer diagnosis or instant improvement in treatment options for most patients. A more intense monitoring of these patients could, however, be advised.
25
] and we therefore interpret this finding as a logical consequence of the high prevalence of patients with fatigue in the study population. Patients with unexplained complaints do not seem to have predominantly psychosocial problems. The domains Social Functioning and Mental Health were not the worst scoring domains in the study population (mean 66.5 and 63.8 respectively). The Role Functioning Physical domain scored much lower (mean 37.2), suggesting that patients with unexplained complaints feel that their physical complaints hinder them in their daily functioning. Of the five categories of unexplained complaints, patients with unexplained fatigue have the poorest quality of life.
early stage unexplained complaints
 does not allow one to draw firm inferences as to whether the lower quality of life levels can be attributed to the unexplained complaints or should be attributed to underlying, though not yet diagnosed conditions, or concurrent comorbidity.
Second, we cannot fully exclude the possibility that some degree of selection bias is present. Participating GPs may have selectively included older patients or those with poorer quality of life. However, in a non-inclusion study in the participating general practices, we searched the electronic medical files by means of text words for eligible but not included patients with unexplained complaints. This non-inclusion study did not show major sex and age differences between included and not-included patients. However, differences may exist on other characteristics.
A third limitation of our study is that no specific depression or anxiety questionnaire was used. At the start of the study, such a poor quality of life was not anticipated and, therefore, only a more general questionnaire was considered sufficient. The RAND-36 mentally/emotionally oriented domain figures and the differences we found when comparing the quality of life profile of unexplained complaint patients with depressed patients however, are not pointing towards the presence of depression or anxiety. Furthermore, the GPs did not consider the included patients to be depressed or suffering from an anxiety disorder, otherwise they would not have labelled the patient as having unexplained complaints by definition. It is not impossible however, that depression or anxiety disorders might play a role in the poor quality of life of patients with unexplained complaints. Maybe these diagnoses are established only by GPs over time, and do not become clear in (one of) the first consultations.
Finally, the patient groups used for comparison of quality of life are perhaps not totally comparable to our study population. For example, there are older patients included in our study population than in the depressed patient groups. Since age has its influence on quality of life this can have influenced the contrast. Also, a depression is a treatable condition, whereas early stage unexplained complaints are not treated yet. The better quality of life in this patient group on some domains can therefore be a treatment effect. We did, however, not intend to study a fully comparable contrast in this sense beforehand, it was a result driven comparison.
Although much research has been performed in patients with more chronic consequences of unexplained complaints, to our knowledge, no other study on demographic characteristics and quality of life of patients with early stage unexplained complaints in general practice has been published.
Patients with unexplained complaints appear to be mainly highly educated women in their forties. They report remarkably poor levels of quality of life. Future research should explore whether and how quality of life scores and other characteristics could help in early identification of patients at risk of developing chronicity. Until then practitioners should at least be aware that early stage unexplained complaints may not always be as mild as is frequently assumed. Early stage unexplained complaints may be associated with considerable suffering on a daily basis. Awareness of potential poor quality of life may help physicians realise that they are dealing with a patient, at least, in need of more intense monitoring but maybe also of more intense treatment approaches.
