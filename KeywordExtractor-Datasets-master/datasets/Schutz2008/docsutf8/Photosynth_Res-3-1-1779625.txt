 for 45 s in the dark. In addition, a “blank” experiment was conducted in which the full extraction procedure was followed in the absence of chloroplasts to measure the extent of any contaminants that may interfere with the analysis. Five repetitions of each experiment were carried out using the same chloroplast preparation.
Reactions were terminated by dissembling the apparatus as quickly as possible and plunging the chloroplast-containing membrane into a beaker of liquid nitrogen. It was estimated that this procedure took no more than 2.5 s. The beaker containing the membrane was then stored in a freezer at −20°C where the liquid nitrogen was allowed to evaporate.
After overnight storage at −20°C the enzymes were denatured and the metabolites were extracted by removing the beaker containing the membranes from the freezer and immediately adding boiling 80% ethanol (75 ml) and boiling for a further 5 min. The membranes were then removed from the extract and thoroughly rinsed with water, adding the washings to the extract. After cooling, the pooled extracts were then evaporated to dryness at 37°C under a stream of dry nitrogen.

Design of a specific photosynthesis apparatus
Because of the limitations of the oxygen electrode for the type of experiments that were required, it was decided to design and construct an apparatus better suited for the purpose.

). A filter membrane loaded with chloroplasts equivalent to 250 μg of chlorophyll should therefore contain 1.25–12.5 nmol of most metabolites of interest. Assuming minimal losses during processing for GC/MS analysis, this was considered to be adequate chloroplast material for each experiment.

). Dephosphorylation of up to 0.5 μmoles of sugar phosphates was carried out by the addition of 0.5 units of prostatic acid phosphatase to the sugar phosphate solution in 0.1 M ammonium acetate–acetic acid buffer pH 4.6 (typically 200 μl) and incubated for 24 h at 30°C. The reaction was terminated by heating at 100°C for 2 min.

) for 1 mg scale derivatizations. In our investigation, smaller-scale derivatizations were required. Up to 350 nmol (approx. 50 μg) of the dried sugars in Reacti-Vials (0.2 ml) were derivatized by the addition, under dry nitrogen, of 1% methoxylamine in pyridine (40 μl) and refluxing at 80°C for 2 h in a Reacti-therm heater. The mixture was cooled to room temperature then silylation was accomplished by the addition under dry nitrogen, of 10 μl of Regisil (Pierce) followed by heating for 0.5 h at 80°C. The mixture was cooled to room temperature then diluted as appropriate with dry pyridine for GC/MS analysis. Injections of 1 μl ideally contained no more than 125 pmol of the sugar under analysis in order to avoid saturation of the mass selective detector, as determined by sensitivity runs with derivatized glucose.

Quantification by GC/MS of sugar phosphates in chloroplast extracts
Quantification of analytes is best achieved by the inclusion in the sample mixture of a known amount of an internal standard having similar chemical and physical characteristics to those of the analytes.

C isotope during photosynthesis and the stable isotope dilution method therefore could not be used. The alternative approach was used of adding a compound that is similar to the sugars under investigation but is unlikely to be encountered in chloroplasts and would be well separated from the analytes on GC/MS.

Sugars which were available in the free form with a high degree of purity were dried for 3 days over phosphorous pentoxide under a low vacuum. Approximately 0.02 g of the dried powder or syrup (ketopentoses) was weighed to five decimal places to prepare standard solutions of each sugar. Appropriate dilutions of these were taken to prepare a set of 0.5 mM standard solutions.

Sugar phosphates (3 μmol) were then evaporated to dryness in a rotary film evaporator and dephosphorylated in a solution (0.5 ml) which contained citrate buffer 50 μmol, pH 5.4) and human prostatic acid phosphatase (1.25 units). After allowing the dephosphorylation to proceed for 4 h at 37°C, the reaction was terminated by heating at 100°C for 2 min. The samples were then treated with mixed bed resin and lyophilized.
Recovery from the dephosphorylation step was assessed by carrying out parallel dephosphorylations of glucose 6-phosphate, fructose 6-phosphate and fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, all of which were assayed enzymically as the free sugars. The recovery of the monophosphates was 88% and of the bisphosphate was 78%. These figures provided a useful estimate of the likely recoveries of those sugars (above), which could not be assayed in the non-phosphorylated form.

As was the case for all but one of the oxygen electrode experiments, the 6 s and 30 s experiments after work-up did not contain a sufficient concentration of the sugar Mox-TMS derivatives, even after combining five experiments, to enable selective ion profiles to be obtained on all of the relevant ions in all of the sugars. This was particularly disappointing as the specially designed apparatus performed well otherwise.
