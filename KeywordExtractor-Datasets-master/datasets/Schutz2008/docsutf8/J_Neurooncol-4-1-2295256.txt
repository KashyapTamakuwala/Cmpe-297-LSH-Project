] found differences in resting state functional connectivity in the same brain tumor population within several frequency bands when compared to healthy controls. Interestingly, in agreement with de Jongh’s results, these differences were not limited to the tumor area and were more obvious in those with a tumor in the left hemisphere.
Since higher cognitive functions are presumed to depend on the integrated activity of several specialized brain areas, it is suggested that neurocognitive deficits may have a stronger correlation with diffuse alterations in resting state brain oscillatory activity than focal abnormalities in the brain tumor population.
In the present MEG-study, power spectral analysis of oscillatory brain activity was used to compare resting state brain oscillatory activity in both LGG patients and healthy controls.
We hypothesize that (1) LGG patients show, in addition to the local abnormalities at the tumor site, global slowing of the resting state brain activity compared to healthy controls which will vary between patients with a tumor in the left or right hemisphere (2) changes in resting state brain oscillatory activity reflect an intermediate level between the impact of tumor and tumor-related treatment on the one hand (‘input’) and the neurocognitive deficits (‘output’) on the other hand and that diffuse slowing is correlated with higher neurocognitive dysfunction.

Materials and methods
Patients and controls
Twenty-three LGG patients were asked to participate in this study. Patients were eligible if: (a) they had a suspected or histologically confirmed LGG; (b) there was no radiological (confirmed by MR or CT scan) and/or clinical tumor progression in the previous 6 months; (c) they did not use medication possibly interfering with neurocognitive function, other than anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs).
Patients were recruited from the VU University Medical Center (VUmc) and the Academic Medical Center (AMC), both tertiary referral centres in Amsterdam for brain tumor patients, after the institutional ethical review boards of both participating hospitals approved the study protocol. Relatives of the patients were asked to participate as healthy controls. Healthy controls were eligible if they: (a) did not suffer from any neurological disease; (b) did not use any medication that might influence cognitive function. For patients who could not provide a healthy control participant, VU University Medical Center staff members were included.

Magnetoencephalography
26
] was used with a recording passband of 0.25–125 Hz and a sample frequency of 312.5 Hz. At the beginning, middle and end of each recording, the head position relative to the coordinate system of the helmet was recorded by leading small alternating currents through three head position coils attached to the left and right preauricular points and the nasion on the subject’s head. Head position changes up to approximately 1.5 cm during a recording condition were accepted.
For this study, 149 of the 151 channels could be used. MEG recordings were converted to ASCII files. From these ASCII files four artefact free epochs of 13 s per subject (4096 samples) were carefully selected by visual analysis by one of the authors (IB).
Magnetic field frequencies ranging from 0.5 to 80 Hz were recorded. The MEG data were digitally filtered off-line in the following frequency bands: delta (0.5–4 Hz), theta (4–8 Hz), lower alpha (8–10 Hz), upper alpha (10–13 Hz), beta (13–30 Hz), gamma (30–50 Hz).

Results
Patient characteristics
From the initial patient group, six patients were excluded, four patients due to metal artefacts on the MEG measurements, one due to severe epileptic seizures, and one due to tumor progression at the time of registration. The final analyses were performed on a sample of 17 patients and 17 matched healthy control participants.

Fourteen of the 17 LGG patients had a histologically confirmed LGG, clinically and radiologically stable for more than six months before inclusion, whereas the other 3 patients were suspected of having LGG, and stable for more than six months. The patients in our study were diagnosed several years ago (mean 8 years, range: 1–19 years). One year after MEG registration two of the three patients with suspected LGG were operated on because of increasing epilepsy frequency.
Eleven of those 16 patients underwent debulking, whereas 3 patients underwent a stereotactic biopsy and another two patients had an open biopsy. Of the 16 patients with a histologically confirmed LGG, the pathological diagnosis was grade II astrocytoma in ten patients, oligodendroglioma grade II in four patients and oligoastrocytoma grade II in two patients.

Discussion
The primary goal of the present study was to evaluate whether LGG patients show (in addition to the well known MEG slowing around the tumor) diffuse slowing in resting state brain activity. The secondary goal of the study was to investigate whether this slowing is correlated with neurocognitive dysfunction. By means of MEG-registrations we have demonstrated that LGG patients have slowing of the resting state brain activity when compared to healthy controls. The decrease in relative power was mainly found in the gamma frequency band in the bilateral frontocentral MEG regions. Regarding the low frequency bands, an increase in relative power was found in the theta frequency band in the left parietal region. Correlations of neurocognitive functioning with the relative power in the patient population showed clear associations in the lower alpha and theta band, increased slowing correlating with poorer performance.
19
20
]. This includes comparisons with other brain tumor data sets but also the comparison of our results with neurodegenerative diseases (including AD and Parkinson’s disease (PD)). This will give us an opportunity to learn more about differences in resting state oscillatory brain activity in the different diseases and at different disease stages. A limitation of this method of analysis is that an increase in one frequency band can cause a decrease in another band, although this might not be the observed pattern in absolute measures.
16
20
]. There are only few studies performed in brain tumor patients, however.
22
22
], we analysed the relative power, which means that the power is influenced by the power in the other frequency bands and therefore group differences in a specific frequency band could results from changes in that specific band or in the absolute power of the other frequency bands. Furthermore, we evaluated diffuse delta activity instead of clusters of dipoles in the vicinity of the tumor. Apart from these technical differences, De Jongh’s patient population consisted of a more heterogeneous group of brain tumor patients. They found a higher delta power in the high-grade gliomas compared to those patients with a low-grade glioma and a delta signal power decrease after surgery. Our patient population consisted exclusively of patients with a low-grade glioma, and all but three MEG registrations were done after surgery, which might explain the lack of changes in the delta band in the present study. It also suggests that changes in the gamma and theta band may be more sensitive indicators of brain dysfunction in LGG.
23
], the authors found focal clusters of fast MEG waves outside the tumor area and even in the contralateral hemisphere. They concluded that the asymmetry possibly reflects features of normal background activity, since asymmetry has already been demonstrated in healthy subjects for the alpha activity which is usually dominant in the right hemisphere. Since De Jongh used a single dipole analysis instead of our analysis of diffuse power changes and, again, analysed a group of patients with diverse brain tumors, it is difficult to compare the results of both studies.
21
] used synthetic aperture magnetometry (SAM) to analyze oscillatory activity recorded by the MEG. SAM is an alternative method investigating the distribution of reconstructed sources over different cortical regions. In contrast to other source localization methods, beamforming does not rely on averaging and therefore allows analysis of evoked and induced brain activity. In a group of 15 patients with various types of primary or secondary brain tumors, they found an increase in delta and theta band activity especially in the vicinity of the tumor and in the surrounding regions of edema. In the majority of these patients, the increase in the delta band correlated well with the clinical symptoms, assessed with a routine neurological examination. The results were not correlated with neurocognitive functioning because they stated that there is much individual variation in brain activity related to neurocognitive function and they expected it difficult and sometimes impossible for these patients to undergo the neurocognitive battery. In contrast to their results, we only found an increase in theta activity and decrease in the gamma frequency band. As mentioned before we analyzed the relative power and also our patient population with only LGG patients is not comparable to the patients with various brain tumors in the study of Oshino. Although, different methods to reconstruct sources can show significant discrepancies, we also found spectral changes in the contralateral hemisphere.
24
], in which we evaluated the functional connectivity (functional connectivity is a statistical correlation between time series of brain activity recorded over distinct regions which are assumed to reflect interactions between the brain regions) in patients with diverse primary brain tumors, we also found that patients with a tumor in the left hemisphere showed more differences in this functional connectivity compared to those with right-sided tumors.

] showed a negative association between lower alpha power and the performance on perseveration-related tasks in the non-demented PD patients.
Evidently, this study has its limitations. First of all, the patient group is rather small as mentioned before. Secondly, although our patient population consisted of only LGG patients, they did not all receive the same treatment. In our study we hypothesized changes in oscillatory brain activity to be the intermediate between the impact of the tumor and its treatment on the one hand and the neurocognitive deficits as the output on the other hand. This study showed that irrespective of the different treatment options, changes in oscillatory brain activity can be found in brain tumor patients which is associated with neurocognitive function. To get informed on the influence of the different tumor treatments on brain activity and its relation with neurocognitive function is very interesting. A longitudinal study of these effects (e.g. surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy) on brain activity is currently under way. The goal of that study is to explore correlations between changes in neurocognitive function and changes in functional brain dynamics during the disease course.
Our study is the first to correlate the relative power with neurocognitive functioning in brain tumor patients. The observed correlations were quite strong and showed that an increased activity in the theta and lower alpha band is correlated with impaired executive functioning, information processing and working memory. This is a first step in unraveling the underlying mechanisms of neurocognitive dysfunction in brain tumor patients. MEG power analysis gives us an interesting tool to assess functional alterations in the patient’s brain in the course of disease and to evaluate its relationship with neurocognitive functioning.
