 was stored as a 50-mM stock solution in water and added directly to solutions immediately before each experiment. Arachidonic acid, phloretin, brefeldin A (BFA), 1-octanol, probenecid, glibenclamide, and apyrase were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA) and BAPTA-AM from DOJINDO (Kumamoto, Japan); they were added to solutions immediately before use from stock solutions in DMSO. DMSO did not have any effect when added alone at concentrations employed in the present study (less than 0.1%).
Osmolality of all solutions was measured using a freezing-point depression osmometer (OM802, Vogel, Kevelaer, Germany).

 cell at a holding potential of −50 mV. Before the actual measurements of ATP release, a calibration curve was constructed by recording the biosensor responses to known concentrations of ATP. The biosensor cell in the whole-cell configuration was lifted by means of a micromanipulator and positioned near a handmade local microperfusion device consisting of several inlet tubes. Each of the inlet tubes was filled with a different concentration of ATP solution ranging from 1 to 20 μM. To minimize the effect of desensitization, the sensor cell was exposed to ATP puffed every 3 min for 1 s to a maximum of five applications. During the measurements of ATP from an individual astrocyte under OGD stress, the biosensor cell was gently touched to the surface of the target cell. From the recorded currents, the concentration of ATP was calculated according to the calibration curve.
