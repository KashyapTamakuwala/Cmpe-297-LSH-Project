Aims/hypothesis
This 52-week multinational, randomised, open-label, parallel-group, non-inferiority trial compared clinical outcomes following supplementation of oral glucose-lowering drugs with basal insulin analogues detemir and glargine in type 2 diabetic patients.

) were randomised 1:1 to receive insulin detemir or glargine once daily (evening) actively titrated to target fasting plasma glucose (FPG) ≤ 6.0 mmol/l. An additional morning insulin detemir dose was permitted if pre-dinner plasma glucose (PG) was >7.0 mmol/l after achieving FPG < 7.0 mmol/l. Due to labelling restrictions, no second glargine dose was allowed.

 = 0.03), primarily related to completers on once-daily detemir. Mean daily detemir dose was higher (0.78 U/kg [0.52 with once daily dosing, 1.00 U/kg with twice daily dosing]) than glargine (0.44 IU/kg). Injection site reactions were more frequent with detemir (4.5 vs 1.4%).

Conclusions/interpretation
Supplementation of oral agents with detemir or glargine achieves clinically important improvements in glycaemic control with low risk of hypoglycaemia. Non-inferiority was demonstrated for detemir using higher insulin doses (mainly patients on twice daily dosing); weight gain was somewhat reduced with once daily insulin detemir.

Study medications
 Oral glucose-lowering therapy, diet and physical activity were recommended to remain stable during the study; no meal-time insulin was allowed. Basal insulin was initiated once daily in the evening at a dose of 12 U and titrated according to a structured treatment algorithm. In line with its licence, people allocated to insulin detemir were allowed to receive an additional morning insulin dose if pre-dinner PG was >7.0 mmol/l, but only if pre-breakfast PG was <7.0 mmol/l or nocturnal hypoglycaemia (major episode or PG ≤ 4.0 mmol/l) precluded achievement of the fasting plasma glucose (FPG) target. Insulin detemir was administered with a pen-injector (FlexPen, Novo Nordisk) 1 h before to 1 h after dinner, and if needed within 30 min of breakfast. Glargine was given once daily at bedtime, via a pen-injector in the EU (OptiPen Pro 1, sanofi-aventis) and with syringes in the USA. The evening dose of insulin detemir was administered somewhat earlier than that of insulin glargine, to allow for the possibility that recipients might be switched to a twice daily schedule, in which case a more even distribution of the dose across 24 h would be achieved.

). Participants measured capillary PG using glucose meters (Medisense Xtra; Abbott, Wiesbaden, Germany). Dose adjustments were to be based on the average of three self-measurements before breakfast (and before dinner if on twice daily insulin detemir). During the first 12 weeks, participants had weekly investigator contact. A titration committee monitored the algorithm for insulin dose optimisation and reviewed prescribed insulin doses periodically. This committee was not informed of the treatment insulin being used, but this would have been evident for participants on twice daily insulin detemir.

Clinic FPG was measured centrally by a hexokinase method (Gluco-quant; Roche, Mannheim, Germany). Body weight was measured using calibrated scales. Participants recorded ten-point PG profiles during the last week of treatment. Hypoglycaemia was classified as ‘major’ if assistance from another person was required, ‘minor’ if confirmed by PG < 3.1 mmol/l or ‘symptoms only’ if PG ≥ 3.1 mmol/l or no measurement was made.

Within-participant variation in self-measured fasting and pre-dinner PG was determined from four measurements for each during the last week of treatment. Hypoglycaemic episodes during the 52 week treatment period were analysed as recurrent events in a Cox regression analysis using a gamma frailty model (Splus 2000; Insightful, Seattle, WA, USA). Nocturnal episodes (2300 to 0600 hours) were analysed separately. Adverse events were summarised using descriptive statistics. All other analyses were performed using SAS version 8.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).

The present study was designed to compare the two basal insulin analogues as they had been used in previous studies and according to label. Thus, insulin glargine was given once daily at bedtime regardless of glycaemic profile, while for insulin detemir an option was provided for adding a second dose, primarily based on pre-dinner blood glucose level following a structured insulin titration protocol. The decision to use twice-daily insulin detemir could not be attributed to hypoglycaemia, as patients who were switched to a twice-daily regimen had on average 3.7 hypoglycaemic episodes per patient-year prior to transfer, compared with 4.7 episodes per patient-year in patients completing treatment on once-daily insulin detemir. The frequency of nocturnal hypoglycaemia was also lower in relevant patients before transfer (0.7 vs 0.9 episodes per patient-year).
