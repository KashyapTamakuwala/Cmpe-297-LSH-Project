]. Stretch of the left atrium is generally controlled by intra-atrial pressure. The Frank–Starling mechanism of the left atrium can be described by a biphasic increase of contraction force after increase of the stretch level.

]. Although there were some limitations of the study in sample size, matching of age groups and gender, the authors were able to demonstrate, that left atrial function increases during heart failure and so compensated the decrease of left ventricular function. The model, described by Tripokiadis et al. can be used to estimate atrial function in patients with systolic and diastolic left ventricular dysfunction but also to evaluate the influence of atrial contribution to ventricular filling after medical treatment. Doing so, individual treatment can be optimised not only taking into account the clinical status, renal status, ventricular remodelling and neurohormonal status (BNP), but also atrial contribution to left ventricular filling.
