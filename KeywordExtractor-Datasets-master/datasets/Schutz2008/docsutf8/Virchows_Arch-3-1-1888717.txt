=53). A tissue microarray (TMA) was generated from the same paraffin blocks to determine whether this technique could be used for EGFR screening in CRC. On tissue sections, 84% of the primary CRC and 94% of the metastases were EGFR-positive. When matched, they showed a concordant EGFR-positive status in 78% of the cases. Moreover, staining intensity and extent of EGFR-positive cells in the primary CRC correlated with those observed in the synchronous metastases. On TMA, 65% of the primary CRC, 66% of the metastases, and 43% of the matched primary CRC metastases were EGFR-positive. There was no concordant EGFR status between the primary and the metastatic sites. A strong discrepancy of EGFR status was noted between TMA and tissue sections. In conclusion, EGFR expression measured in tissue sections from primary CRC and their related metastases was found to be similar and frequent, but it was significantly underestimated by the TMA technique.

EGFR immunohistochemistry

]. Immunohistochemistry of the tumors was performed by using the Dako autostainer and the EGFR pharmDx™ kit (K1494, Dako, Glostrup, Denmark), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 4-μm-thick sections were mounted on silanized slides and allowed to dry overnight at 37°C. After deparaffinization and rehydratation, slides were incubated with 3% hydrogen peroxide for 5 min. After washing with the supplied buffer, tissue sections were covered for 5 min with a proteinase K solution. The slides were then incubated for 30 min with the primary mouse anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody (clone 2-18C9), which binds to a formalin-resistant epitope near the ligand-binding site on the extracellular domain of EGFR. After two rinses in buffer, the slides were incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-labeled polymer coupled to secondary antibodies for 30 min. Tissue staining was visualized with diaminobenzidine as substrate-chromogen solution. Slides were counterstained with hematoxylin, dehydrated, and mounted. Negative control sections were processed without the primary antibody but with an irrelevant murine IgG1 supplied with the kit. Negative and positive control cell slides (CAMA-1 and HT29 cell lines, respectively), provided with the EGFR pharmDx™ kit, were also used to ensure that each assay run was performed appropriately and according to protocol specifications. Furthermore, perineurium and normal mucosae on primary CRC and hepatocytes surrounding the metastases were considered as positive internal controls on tumor slides.

Tissue microarray
Tissue blocks appearing to have enough material upon gross inspection were initially selected and hematoxylin–eosin-stained sections were evaluated by two observers (F. Bibeau and F. Boissière-Michot) for the presence of carcinoma. The areas to be used for the construction of the TMAs were marked on the slide and the donor block. Particular attention was made to select invasive cells near the tumor front. The tissues corresponding to selected areas were sampled using a manual arraying instrument (Manual Tissue Arrayer 1, Beecher Instruments, Sun Prairie, WI, USA). Two TMAs were constructed using 0.6-mm tissue cores. The sampling consisted of three malignant cores from different areas of the tumor from a single case of invasive colorectal cancer, placed at specified coordinates. When possible, normal mucosa was also sampled as internal control. After the arraying was completed, TMA blocks were sectioned at a thickness of 4 μm. One section was stained with hematoxylin–eosin, and EGFR immunostaining using the immunohistochemical system kit EGFR pharmDx™ was performed on the adjacent section. Among the 32 cases sampled, 31 primary CRC, 29 metastatic sites, and 28 matched sites were assessable with this technology.

EGFR immunohistochemical staining scoring system
6
]. Results were reported as positive when a complete or incomplete circumferential membrane staining was observed in at least 1% of the tumor cells. Staining was defined as immunostaining of tumor cell membranes above background level and scored as follows: 1+=weak, 2+=moderate, and 3+=strong. The absence of membrane staining or cytoplasmic staining was reported as negative. The percentage of stained cells was assessed as follows: 1–10, 10–50, and >50%. Slides were scored by two pathologists (F. Bibeau and J.C. Sabourin), who were blinded to the patients’ characteristics. In the case of disagreement (three out of 91 specimens), the EGFR status was determined by consensus after simultaneous dual reexamination.
In addition to these standardized criteria, a semiquantitative analysis was performed taking into account both the staining intensity and the percentage of positive tumor cells.

Statistical analysis
The cut-off value for negative/positive expression of EGFR was 1% of tumor cells displaying a membranous staining, as specified by the EGFR pharmDx™ scoring guidelines. Data were summarized by frequency and percentage for categorical variables and by means, standard deviations, median, and range for continuous variables. For TMA analysis, the percentage of positive cells was calculated from the mean of triple cores.
P
 value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Due to the small number of patients with metachronous metastases, only the correlation between the matched primary CRC and the synchronous metastatic sites was made.


Results
EGFR expression of primary CRC and their related metastases on tissue sections
EGFR reactivity was not homogeneous throughout the tumors. EGFR immunostaining was mainly observed in the deepest region of the primary CRC or at the periphery of metastases, especially in the liver. Of note, EGFR immunoreactivity was often greater in isolated tumor cells and in small clusters of tumor cells.

Nine (28%), 10 (31%), and eight (25%) of the primary CRC and seven (22%), 14 (44%), and nine (28%) of the synchronous metastases displayed a weak, moderate, and strong positivity, respectively. According to the extent of EGFR immunoreactivity, five (16%) primary CRC had no reactivity, 12 (37.5%) had <10% reactive cells, eight (25%) had >10–50% positive cells, and seven (22%) had >50% labeled cells. In the synchronous metastases, two cases (6%) were negative, 13 (41%) had <10% reactive cells, 11 (34%) had >10–50% positive cells, and six (19%) had >50% labeled cells.

Nevertheless, 13 cases (46%) remained discordant (i.e., six positive primary and negative metastases, and seven, conversely). Moreover, using the TMA technology and whatever the number of cores (three or six), we failed to demonstrate any correlation of EGFR expression between primitive sites and matched metastases.

]. Consequently, knowledge of EGFR metastastic status could be of potential value for therapeutic decisions, particularly if it differs from the primary tumors.
To answer the question as to whether EGFR expression is similar in different tumor sites, we compared the EGFR status of a set of primary CRC and their corresponding synchronous distant metastases, using a standardized immunohistochemistry test (EGFR pharmDx™, Dako). We also analyzed EGFR expression in metachronous metastases, when available, to study possible changes of EGFR expression during the metastatic process of CRC.
