Objective
The objective of our study was to examine the management of the interaction between acenocoumarol or phenprocoumon and several antibiotics by anticoagulation clinics and to compare the consequences of this interaction on users of co-trimoxazole with those for users of other antibiotics.

Methods
A follow-up study was conducted at four anticoagulation clinics in The Netherlands. Data on measurements of the International Normalised Ratio (INR), application of a preventive dose reduction (PDR) of the coumarin anticoagulant, fever and time within or outside the therapeutic INR range were collected.

Results
The study cohort consisted of 326 subjects. A PDR was given more often to users of co-trimoxazole PDR than to users of other antibiotics. The PDR in co-trimoxazole users resulted in a significantly reduced risk of both moderate overanticoagulation (INR >4.5) and severe overanticoagulation (INR >6.0) compared with no PDR, with odds ratios (ORs) of 0.06 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.01–0.51] and 0.09 (95% CI: 0.01–0.92), respectively. In co-trimoxazole users without PDR, the risk of overanticoagulation was significantly increased compared with users of other antibiotics. All co-trimoxazole users spent significantly more time under the therapeutic INR range during the first 6 weeks after the course than users of other antibiotics.

Conclusion
PDR is effective in preventing overanticoagulation in co-trimoxazole users, but results in a significantly prolonged period of underanticoagulation after the course. Avoidance of concomitant use of co-trimoxazole with acenocoumarol or phenprocoumon seems to be a safer approach than management of the interaction between these drugs.

reactive
 dose-adjustment); (2) a preventive (coumarin) dose reduction (PDR) preceding an INR measurement during or after the antibiotic course, assuming that use of an antibiotic or the intercurrent infection itself increases the risk of overanticoagulation. The PDR approach seems even more relevant to co-trimoxazole than to other antibiotics because the CYP2C9-inhibiting effect of the former might increase the risk of overanticoagulation more than the infectious state alone. However, PDR could also lead to temporary undertreatment, and evidence for the effectiveness of this approach is currently lacking. There are no official guidelines for such dose adjustments, and the application of PDR strongly depends on the personal view of the responsible physician.
The aim of the present study was to examine the management of the interaction between coumarin anticoagulants and antibiotics by anticoagulation clinics and its consequences for users of co-trimoxazole and other antibiotics. To this end, we conducted a prospective follow-up study at four anticoagulation clinics in The Netherlands.

Materials and methods
Study design
This was a follow-up study conducted at four anticoagulation clinics in The Netherlands. We included patients who were stabilised on one of the coumarin anticoagulants acenocoumarol or phenprocoumon and who had started using one of the following antibiotics between January 2001 and October 2003: co-trimoxazole, amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, clarithromycin, doxycyclin, nitrofurantoin, norfloxacin or trimethoprim. In addition to co-trimoxazole, we chose the other antibiotics based on their use for the same kind of infections, mainly those of the urinary and respiratory tract.

].
We excluded subjects from our analyses in whom the INR was not measured during the course of the antibiotic and who used the antibiotic for a period shorter than 3 days and longer than 14 days. If the INR was not measured during the course, an interaction effect of the antibiotic could be missed. Antibiotics used for less than 3 days or more than 14 days are usually prescribed for prophylaxis not for acute infections.

Setting and attitudes of anticoagulation clinics on antibiotic use
All anticoagulation clinics in The Netherlands monitor the INR in outpatients at a frequency varying from a few days to maximally 6 weeks. The two target therapeutic ranges are the normal therapeutic range (INR: 2.0–3.5) and the high therapeutic range (INR: 2.5–4.0).
The initiation of the use of an antibiotic is usually reported to the anticoagulation clinics by the patients, their pharmacists and/or the prescribing physicians.
The four anticoagulation clinics participating in this study had different attitudes on the management of the interaction between coumarins and antibiotics. The approach of three of the anticoagulation clinics was to decrease the coumarin dose preventively if co-trimoxazole was prescribed; one of the anticoagulation clinics applied a PDR of 20–25% in the case of co-trimoxazole use. If one of the other antibiotics examined in this study was prescribed, the application of a PDR would depend on the seriousness of the disease and on the occurrence of fever. The fourth anticoagulation clinic had no established protocols for dose reduction but indicated that it would monitor the INR of every user of co-trimoxazole within 3–5 days after initiation of the course.

after
 the antibiotic course, we recorded the time spent within, above and under the therapeutic range from the starting date of the antibiotic until the last INR measurement within 6 weeks following the starting date of the antibiotic. Six weeks is the maximal period between two INR measurements if a patient is well stabilised. Furthermore, after a longer follow-up period, differences between patients could be more attributable to other factors than to the infection or antibiotic use. If after the first INR during the antibiotic course no second INR measurement was available within the 6-week period after the starting date of the antibiotic, we recorded no follow-up time and no time spent within, above or under the therapeutic range.

Outcomes

time spent within, above and under the therapeutic INR range from the starting date of the antibiotic until the last INR measurement within 6 weeks following the starting date of the antibiotic.




Calculations and statistical analysis
We assessed the effects of the PDR within the group of users of co-trimoxazole and within the group of users of other antibiotics by comparing the occurrence of overanticoagulation in patients for whom a PDR had been applied with the occurrence of overanticoagulation in patients for whom PDR had not been applied (logistic regression models). We also compared the occurrence of overanticoagulation and time spent within, under and above the therapeutic range of co-trimoxazole users with users of other antibiotics (reference group). These comparisons were made for patients with PDR and for patients without PDR. Finally, we compared the time spent within, under and above the therapeutic range in patients for whom a PDR had been applied with those for whom a PDR had not been applied (reference) within the groups of co-trimoxazole users and users of other antibiotics (linear regression models). In all models we adjusted for the potential confounding covariates sex, age, target therapeutic range and fever, as indicated by the patient. Covariates were added to the statistical models one at a time. We adjusted for a covariate if it changed the point estimation of the outcome of interest by 5% or more upon inclusion in the model.

Although all patients were stable when they were included in our study, we re-analysed our statistically significant outcomes after excluding patients in whom destabilisation could be due to factors other than those of infection and/or fever (presence of thyroid disease, malignancy or use of other enzyme-inhibiting or-inducing drugs).

Results
A total of 424 patients who met the inclusion criteria gave their informed consent to participate in our study. Of these patients, 81 did not have assesment of the INR during the antibiotic course, 14 used the antibiotic for less than 3 days, and 3 used the antibiotic for more than 14 days.

 P
 = 0.027). If less than a 20% PDR was applied, the difference between the users of co-trimoxazole and those of other antibiotics shrunk and was no longer significant.
The application of a PDR differed between anticoagulation clinics. Three of the four anticoagulation clinics participating in this study applied PDR as a rule in co-trimoxazole users (83.3–85.7%). In terms of users of other antibiotics, the application of a PDR was more varied: in three of the anticoagulation clinics PDR was sometimes applied (in 17.6–50.8% of all cases), whereas one anticoagulation clinic did not apply the PDR approach at all. The overall percentage of time spent within the therapeutic range during the first 6 weeks after initiation of an antibiotic ranged from 73.7 to 78.0% at all four anticoagulation clinics. In the anticoagulation clinic that did not apply a PDR, overanticoagulation (INR>4.5) occurred most frequently for the all antibiotics class (26.9 vs.10.8–22.7% in the other clinics), with the difference being most marked for co-trimoxazole (54.4 vs. 14.3–16.7% in the other clinics).

Re-analysis of our results after excluding patients with thyroid diseases and malignancy or those using enzyme-inhibiting or -inducing drugs gave similar point estimates or trends, significance for severe overanticoagulation in users of co-trimoxazole compared to other antibiotics and for time spent within the therapeutic range for users of co-trimoxazole in whom PDR was not applied (data not shown).

Discussion
The results of the present study, in which we evaluated the management of the interaction between antibiotics and coumarin anticoagulants by anticoagulation clinics, demonstrated that a PDR reduces the risk of overanticoagulation in co-trimoxazole users to the level of other antibiotic users, but also that management of the interaction between coumarins and co-trimoxazole results in a significantly longer period of undertreatment during the first 6 weeks after initiation of the antibiotic.

].
Although PDRs as applied in clinical practice are effective in reducing the overanticoagulation risk in co-trimoxazole users, the price that has to be paid for the concurrent use of co-trimoxazole is a significantly prolonged period of underanticoagulation compared with the use of other antibiotics during the first 6 weeks after the antibiotic course. This difference was more marked in the subgroup of subjects in whom PDR was not applied. Possible explanations for this result are (1) the usually shorter time span between PDR and the first INR measurement (always within the course) compared to the time span between a reactive dose reduction following supratherapeutic INR and subsequent INR measurement (usually after the course) and (2) the higher reactive dose reduction which is applied in the case of severe overanticoagulation (INR >6.0). However, even co-trimoxazole users for whom the PDR had been applied had a significantly prolonged period of underanticoagulation compared with all of the users of other antibiotics (PDR applied and PDR not applied taken together). This last comparison is totally logical because our results strongly suggest that a PDR should always be applied in co-trimoxazole users, whereas this is as a rule not required in users of other antibiotics. The adjusted difference in time spent under the therapeutic range – ranging from 6.9 (PDR applied) to 22.5% (PDR not applied) – corresponds to about 2–7 days of the mean follow-up time of 30 days in otherwise stabilised patients; this time interval is clinically relevant and can be avoided by substituting co-trimoxazole.

 polymorphism and wild-type patients. It should be clear that our results only apply to patients with a stabilised anticoagulation state at the initiation of the antibiotic course.
In conclusion, if co-trimoxazole is prescribed to users of coumarin anticoagulants, the interaction can be managed by applying PDR, which adequately decreases the risk of overanticoagulation, but this successful management comes at the cost of a prolonged period of underanticoagulation after the course. Consequently, rather than managing the interaction it is better to avoid prescribing co-trimoxazole as a therapeutically equivalent alternative is always available.
