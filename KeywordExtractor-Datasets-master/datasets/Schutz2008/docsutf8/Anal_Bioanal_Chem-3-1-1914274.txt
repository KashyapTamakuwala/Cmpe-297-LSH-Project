Reactive oxygen species (ROS) can damage proteins, cause lipid peroxidation, and react with DNA, ultimately resulting in harmful effects. Antioxidants constitute one of the defense systems used to neutralize pro-oxidants. Since pro-oxidants and antioxidants are found ubiquitously in nature, pro-and antioxidant effects of individual compounds and of mixtures receive much attention in scientific research. A major bottleneck in these studies, however, is the identification of the individual pro-oxidants and antioxidants in mixtures. Here, we describe the development and validation of an on-line post-column biochemical detection system for ROS-producing compounds and antioxidants in mixtures. Inclusion of cytochrome P450s and cytochrome P450 reductase also permitted the screening of compounds that need bioactivation to exert their ROS-producing properties. This pro-oxidant and antioxidant detection system was integrated on-line with gradient HPLC. The resulting high-resolution screening technology was able to separate mixtures of ROS-producing compounds and antioxidants, allowing each species to be characterized rapidly and sensitively.

]. In short: livers from β-NF induced rats were homogenized at 4 °C in two volumes of 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) with 0.9% sodium chloride using a Potter-Elvehjem (Sigma) homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged for 20 min at 12.000×g, and the supernatant obtained was further centrifuged for 60 min at 100.000×g. The resulting pellet was washed twice and subsequently resuspended in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), 0.9% sodium chloride, and 25% glycerol, and stored at −80 °C. The protein concentration in the microsomes was determined as 13.1 mg/ml. Protein concentrations were determined with the standard Bio-Rad (Hercules, CA, USA) protein assay based on the method of Bradford.

] and organic modifiers (that are necessary when the PAD system is operated in on-line gradient HPLC mode) were investigated as well. Potassium phosphate buffer (50 mM; pH 7.8) was used in all experiments. Initial conditions were rat liver microsomes (50 μg/ml), NADPH (40 μM), 4-HPAA (1 mM), SOD (10 U/ml), and HRP (10 U/ml). Reactions were started after 5 min of pre-incubation with the addition of paraquat (70 μM). The different parameters were optimized in the abovementioned order. When the optimal (or best compromise) concentration of every parameter was subsequently used in the optimization of the next parameter. After the optimization process, the optimized conditions were used in the PAD system in FIA and HPLC mode.

-ascorbic acid and glutathione, in flow injection analysis (FIA) mode. The on-line PAD system was then coupled to gradient HPLC and this was used in HRS mode to screen for individual compounds in mixtures based on their ROS-producing and/or antioxidant properties.
Optimization of pro-oxidant and antioxidant detection assay
The optimization of the biochemical assay for the PAD system was conducted first in an off-line batch format before the optimized biochemical assay was transferred to the PAD system in FIA and HPLC modes. Paraquat was used as a model ROS-producing compound. The following parameters were optimized: enzyme concentrations (rat liver microsomes, SOD, and HRP), cofactor NADPH and substrate 4-HPAA, blocking reagents PEG3350 and PEG6000, the detergent Tween 20 (which can improve the resolution of the on-line PAD system) and organic modifiers (that are necessary when the on-line PAD system is operated on-line in gradient HPLC mode). All optimizations were performed without the presence of paraquat as the continuous ROS-producing compound in SL-B. However, paraquat (0.036 mM) was added to the SL-B in the final optimized system in order to permit measurements of both pro-oxidants and antioxidants using the on-line PAD system.

]. Moreover, when on-line biodetection systems are operated in the HPLC mode, organic modifiers are automatically introduced via the HPLC gradient. When testing MeOH, ACN, and IPA in the off-line biochemical batch assay format, they were tolerated up to concentrations of 10%, resulting in approximately half the fluorescence signal compared to that obtained when organic modifiers were not used.
Optimized conditions were derived from the abovementioned experiments performed in the off-line batch assay format and subsequently translated to the on-line PAD system in FIA mode. These final conditions were: a carrier solution consisting of 10% MeOH and 100 mg/l Tween 20 at a flow rate of 100 μl/min; SL-A containing potassium phosphate buffer (50 mM; pH 7.8), rat liver microsomes (50 μg/ml), HRP (18 U/ml), and SOD (14 U/ml), and SL-B with the same buffer containing PEG6000 (1 mg/ml), NADPH (44 μM), and 4-HPAA (1.2 mM). For continuous ROS production (resulting in a stable fluorescent baseline), paraquat was present in the optimized system in SL-B at a concentration of 0.036 mM. Both superloops had a flow-rate of 100 μl/min.

. These sensitivities were of the same order as those obtained with the off-line batch assay format (data not shown). Thus, the present PAD system provided a useful novel rapid screening tool for pro-oxidant and antioxidant activities of individual compounds in mixtures in this respect too.

On-line coupling of the PAD system to gradient HPLC
The PAD system in gradient HPLC mode was evaluated by analyzing the five test compounds after HPLC separation with a decreasing flow-rate gradient. The advantage of this decreasing flow-rate gradient lies with the initially high flow-rate through the column at low concentrations of organic modifier, which results in better eluting compound resolution at the start of the gradient. At higher concentrations of organic modifier, the flow rates are obviously gradually decreased (and the post-column counteracting flow rates are gradually increased) in order to obtain a continuous flow rate (1 ml/min) and concentration of organic modifier (of 10%) after mixing in the post-column counteracting gradient. This results in a constant flow rate and organic modifier concentration (after the 1:9 split) when entering the on-line PAD. The added value of this approach is that alterations in the chromatographic method can be made without much effect on the on-line PAD assay.

Conclusion
This paper presents the development and validation of a HRS-based on-line post-column detection system for the detection of ROS-producing compounds as well as antioxidants in mixtures. Different parameters, such as substrate (4-HPAA) and enzyme concentrations, reaction time, temperature, additives, and organic modifier concentrations were first optimized for the PAD system used in FIA mode. Several ROS-producing compounds as well as antioxidants were successfully measured with the optimized system. The intraday and interday variabilities of the PAD system used in FIA mode were determined and found to be lower than 5%. Good sensitivities, at least comparable with similar off-line batch assay formats for individual compounds, were obtained. On-line coupling of the novel PAD system to gradient HPLC permitted the screening of individual compounds in mixtures for ROS-producing and antioxidant properties. It should be noted, however, that compounds that show fluorescence quenching or intrinsic fluorescence may interfere with the methodology. However, it may be possible to adjust the system so that another split directs some of the flow to a second on-line assay that measures these artifacts with a “negative control PAD system” in order to detect such interferences. This PAD system used in gradient HPLC mode is potentially of great value to drug discovery and toxicology and food research.
