Low birth-weight has been associated with depression and related outcomes in adults, and with problem behaviours in children. This study aimed to examine the association between low birth-weight for gestation and depressive symptoms in children and adolescents and to examine whether the relationship is moderated by genetic risk for depression. An epidemiological, genetically sensitive design was used including 2,046 twins aged 8–17 years (1,023 families). Data were obtained by parental report and analysed using regression analysis. A small but significant association between birth-weight for gestation and early depressive symptoms was observed. The unit increase in depressive symptoms per unit decrease in birth-weight for gestation was greater for individuals at genetic or familial risk for depression. For low birth-weight children, genetic risk for depression moderated the influence of birth-weight for gestation in predicting early depressive symptoms. Birth-weight for gestation is moderated by genetic and familial risk for depression in influencing early depression symptoms. These observations have clinical implications in that the impact of being small for gestational age on depressive symptoms is greater in children at familial/genetic risk although the association between birth weight and depression does not imply causality.

We used a population-based twin register to first examine the association between birth-weight and depressive symptoms and then to test whether this effect was moderated by familial and genetic risk for depression.

=the regression constant, C=the co-twin depression score, R=a coefficient of genetic relatedness (0.5 for DZ twins; 1 for MZ twins), I is the interaction term (C*R*birth-weight corrected for gestation), M=the main effect of birth-weight (with the length of gestation regressed out) and G=twin gender. One twin’s depression score was entered as the dependent variable, with co-twin depression, genetic relatedness and the interaction term as independent variables. Regression analyses were carried out using both continuous and categorical measures of birth-weight corrected for gestational age. Low birth-weight for gestation was classified as ≤10th centile since standard published cut points were not available for birth weights of twins.

]. We find that genetic risk interacts with LBW for gestation in influencing depression. Standard regression analysis treating birth-weight for gestation as a continuous variable also showed that familial risk but not genetic risk interacts with birth-weight. These results suggest that being at genetic or familial risk for depression increases the influence that being small for gestational age has on depression. This result suggests that there may be public health implications for the future mental health of infants who are small for gestational age if there is also a family history of depression.

=0.975). This observation reduces the possibility that the influence of birth-weight on depressive symptoms observed in the present study is due to an association with maternal depression although it does not rule out the possibility. Birth weight is influenced by a number of psychosocial and maternal health characteristics including social class, pre-natal smoking, maternal height, weight, age and parity. There were three such factors that have previously been found to influence birth weight, for which data were available in this study (social class, pre-natal smoking, maternal age at birth of child). These were included as predictor variables in regression models in addition to child gender, thus effects for birth weight adjusted for gestation in the present study are independent of these variables although we were not able to control for all variables that have previously been associated with birth weight (e.g. maternal weight at birth).

]. One final potential criticism is that birth-weight in twins may not mean the same as in singletons. However, the twin design was necessary to allow for the effects of genetic influences and until susceptibility genes for depression are identified, molecular genetic indicators of risk for depression are not feasible.
In summary, the present results suggest that LBW for gestation and genetic/familial factors co-act and interact in influencing early parent-rated depressive symptoms. These observations suggest that it may be useful to monitor children in cases where there is a family history of depression and the child was small for gestational age.
