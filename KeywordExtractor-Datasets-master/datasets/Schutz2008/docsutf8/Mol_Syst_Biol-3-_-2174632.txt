We conducted a comprehensive analysis of a manually curated human signaling network containing 1634 nodes and 5089 signaling regulatory relations by integrating cancer-associated genetically and epigenetically altered genes. We find that cancer mutated genes are enriched in positive signaling regulatory loops, whereas the cancer-associated methylated genes are enriched in negative signaling regulatory loops. We further characterized an overall picture of the cancer-signaling architectural and functional organization. From the network, we extracted an oncogene-signaling map, which contains 326 nodes, 892 links and the interconnections of mutated and methylated genes. The map can be decomposed into 12 topological regions or oncogene-signaling blocks, including a few ‘oncogene-signaling-dependent blocks' in which frequently used oncogene-signaling events are enriched. One such block, in which the genes are highly mutated and methylated, appears in most tumors and thus plays a central role in cancer signaling. Functional collaborations between two oncogene-signaling-dependent blocks occur in most tumors, although breast and lung tumors exhibit more complex collaborative patterns between multiple blocks than other cancer types. Benchmarking two data sets derived from systematic screening of mutations in tumors further reinforced our findings that, although the mutations are tremendously diverse and complex at the gene level, clear patterns of oncogene-signaling collaborations emerge recurrently at the network level. Finally, the mutated genes in the network could be used to discover novel cancer-associated genes and biomarkers.

Introduction
et al

Nowell, 1976
).
Genetic mutations of the signaling proteins might overactivate key cell-signaling properties such as cell proliferation or survival and then give rise to the cell with selective advantages for uncontrolled cellular growth and promoting tumor progression. In addition, mutations may also inhibit the function of tumor-suppressor proteins, resulting in a relief from normal constraints on growth. Furthermore, epigenetic alterations by promoter methylation, resulting in transcriptional repression of genes controlling tumor malignancy, is another important mechanism for the loss of gene function that can provide a selective advantage to tumor cells.

). Although there is a wealth of knowledge regarding molecular signaling in cancer, the complexity of human cancer prevents us from gaining an overall picture of the mechanisms by which these genetic and epigenetic events affect cancer cell signaling and tumor progression. Where are the oncogenic stimuli embedded in the network architecture? What are the principles by which genetic and epigenetic alterations trigger oncogene-signaling events? Given that so many genes have genetic and epigenetic aberrations in cancer signaling, what is the architecture of cancer signaling? Do any tumor-driven signaling events represent ‘oncogenic dependence' (the phenomenon by which certain cancer cells become dependent on certain signaling cascades for growth or survival)? Who are the central players in oncogene signaling? Are there any signaling partnerships generally used to generate tumor phenotypes? To answer these questions, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of cancer mutated and methylated genes on a human signaling network, focusing on network structural aspects and quantitative analysis of gene mutations on the network.

), which is in agreement with the notion that cancer-associated methylated genes play roles as tumor suppressors. Collectively, these facts suggest that mutated and methylated genes have different regulatory mechanisms in cancer signaling and support the notion that gene mutations and methylations are strongly selected in tumor samples.
et al

Ferrell, 2002

). Gain-of-function mutants in a positive regulatory loop afford the amplification of weak input stimuli and serve as information storage to extend the duration of activation of the affected downstream proteins. This might allow the downstream signaling cascades to persistently hold and transfer information leading to tumor phenotypes.
et al
, 2007
et al
, 2007
et al
, 2005
). A loss of function of gene methylation in a negative regulatory loop could break the negative feedbacks, thereby releasing the restrained activation signals and promoting oncogenic state transitions. Homeostasis relies on the balance between positive and negative signals in crucial components of the network. Both the gain-of-function mutated genes in positive regulatory loops and the loss-of-function methylated genes in negative regulatory loops could break this delicate balance, thus promoting state transitions and generating tumor phenotypes. Therefore, both mutated and methylated genes and their regulatory loops (oncogenic regulatory loops) are critical components of the network where the oncogenic stimuli occur.

), respectively, are included in the map. More importantly, in addition to known oncogenic pathways, there are many other novel candidate cancer-signaling cascades present in the map. For a given gene mutation in a tumor, one could use this map to generate testable hypotheses to discover the underlying oncogene-signaling cascades in that tumor.
As mentioned above, oncogene-signaling-dependent events, which we define as the interactions between the cancer mutated or methylated genes, are frequently found in tumor samples and represent various oncogene-driving events that could play more critical roles in generating tumor phenotypes. To systematically identify such events and discover how they are organized in the map, we charted the gene mutation frequency onto the map and highlighted the signaling links between any two genes that have high mutation frequencies. Most genes have mutation frequencies lower than 2%, whereas a handful of genes have very high mutation frequencies, such as p53 (41%), PI3K (10%) and RAS (15%) (see Materials and methods). Therefore, a gene mutation frequency equal to or greater than 2% was considered as high. Interestingly, nearly 10% of the links in the map are oncogene-signaling-dependent events. Certain signaling events such as Pten-PI3K and RAS-PI3K in the map are well-known oncogene-signaling-dependent events/cascades that are frequently used in various cancers.

). These results suggest that the crucial players of oncogene signaling tend to be closely clustered and regionalized. This map uncovers the architectural structure of the basic oncogene signaling and highlights the signaling events that are highly conserved in generating tumor phenotypes.

), which is well known to take part in tumorigenesis. Notably, Block 1 is enriched with cell surface receptor-linked signaling, whereas Block 10 is enriched with intracellular signaling cascades. Block 11 is enriched with tumor suppressors and biological processes such as apoptosis and cell cycle. These results suggest that certain blocks are taking part in different parts/kinds of signaling, that is, cell surface receptor-related signaling, intracellular signaling, cascade signaling and apoptotic signaling. However, three oncogene-signaling blocks have no GO enrichment detected. One of the reasons is that a fraction of the genes in these blocks is not well annotated yet. For example, about one-third of genes in Block 6 have no GO term associated.
Supplementary Table 7
). Significantly, only three collaborative gene pairs came from the same block, whereas other collaborative gene pairs came from two different blocks, with predominantly one of them arising from Block 11 (defined as p53 block), which contains p53, Rb, p14, BRCA1, BRCA2 and several other genes involved in control of DNA damage repair and cell division. Collectively, these results suggest that the signaling genes from different blocks most likely work together in a complementary way to generate tumor phenotypes.

). Activation of genes in the RAS block promotes the cell proliferation, whereas inactivation of genes in the p53 block prevents apoptosis. Thus, a functional collaboration between the genes in these two blocks would promote synergistic cancer signaling and foster tumorigenesis.
et al

). Indeed, the average gene mutation frequency in the p53 block is higher than that of other signaling blocks including the RAS block. (b) The methylation of genes in the cancer stem cells resulting in long-term loss of expression represents the early stage of the tumorigenesis. In fact, most of the members of the p53 block are methylated in cancer stem cells. These facts further support that the p53 block might play an important role in the earlier stages of oncogenesis. (c) Gene methylation or inactivating mutations of DNA damage checkpoint genes such as p53 induce genome instability and thus increase the chance of other gene mutations, including the genes of other oncogene-signaling blocks that could functionally collaborate with the p53 block genes to generate tumor phenotypes.

, signaling block collaborative patterns are tissue dependent and are classified into two groups. One group contains pancreas, skin, central nervous system and blood tumors that have simple block collaborative patterns. In these tumors, signaling collaborations are mainly between Block p53, Block RAS with some minor contributions from Blocks 5, 6 or 7, suggesting that they predominantly use these oncogene-signaling routes to generate tumors resulting in relatively homogenous cancer cell types. The other group contains breast and lung tumors that also contain large proportions of mutations from the p53 block, but also have complex patterns of collaborations between assortments of multiple blocks, suggesting that these tumors may have a larger variety of oncogene-signaling routes, which may explain, in part, the heterogeneous nature of the tumor subtypes in this category. These results might also explain why both lung and breast cancers are the most common types of human tumors.

The mutated genes in the network provide a predictive power

), has numerous links to the mutated genes in the network. To further investigate the predictive power of the mutated genes in the network, we took the 14 network genes, which not only have at least four links to the mutated genes, but also are not implicated in cancer in the literature, to perform a survival analysis using a microarray data set that contains the gene expression profiles and survival information for 295 breast tumor samples. As a result, the expression profiles of 5 out of the 14 genes (36%) are able to discriminate ‘good' and ‘bad' tumors (i.e., patients having ‘bad' tumors have higher chance of tumor recurrence and short survival time). Therefore, these genes are potentially novel biomarkers. In contrast, less than 10% of the nonmutated network genes have similar discriminatory power. These results suggest that the network genes, which have more links to the mutated genes, have more chance to be perturbed in tumorigenesis and be associated with cancer. Practically, the mutated genes in the network provide a predictive power that can be used to discover novel biomarkers of tumors.

Concluding remarks
Although a wide variety of genetic and epigenetic events contribute to the signaling of tumorigenesis, it has been challenging to gain a global view of where and how they affect the signaling alterations to generate tumors on the entire signaling network. By integrative analysis of the human signaling network with cancer-associated mutated and methylated genes, we uncovered an overall picture of the network architecture where the oncogenic stimuli occur and the regulatory mechanisms involving mutated and methylated genes. Mutations, the majority of which are activating, preferentially occur in the signaling hub genes (but not neutral hubs) and the genes of the positive regulatory loops, whereas methylated alterations tend to occur in the genes of the negative regulatory loops. Cancer and cell signaling have been well established, and extensive efforts have been made to illustrate cancer signaling during the past few decades. However, it has been a struggle to get clues of how the oncogene signaling is structurally and functionally organized. In this analysis, we extracted an oncogene-signaling map, which provides a blueprint of the oncogene signaling in cancer cells. From the map, we discerned that the oncogene-signaling-dependent events form three highly connected regions that resemble oncogene-signaling superhighways frequently used in tumorigenesis. Topologically, the map has been divided into 12 oncogene-signaling blocks. Functional collaborations between subsets of these blocks are underlying tumorigenesis. In most tumors, genes in both p53 and RAS blocks often get mutated, although the combinations of p53 with other signaling blocks are also found in a small fraction of tumors. Analysis of the NCI-60 cell line panel mutations showed the enrichment of gene mutations in p53 and RAS blocks, which is similar to the patterns found in the 592 samples. Furthermore, we can dissect some of this functional collaboration among different tumor types. These facts indicate that at least two signaling gene mutations, one from the p53 block and the other from another block, are necessary for tumorigenesis. This fact supports the notion that both the prevention of cell death (p53 block) and the promotion of cell proliferation (RAS or other blocks) are necessary to generate most tumors.

in toto
, most signaling gene mutations are limited to 2–3 critical mutations, divided among several signaling blocks, per individual tumor. This result suggests that the mutations in the samples of the same tumor type might share a similar underlying signaling mechanism, because each oncogene-signaling block contains a set of genes linked together through shared regulatory relations and key input and/or output signaling nodes that are involved in tumorigenesis. These findings imply that although the mutations seem tremendously diverse and complex at the gene level, clear patterns emerge recurrently at the network level in most tumors. Therefore, with proper bioinformatics analysis, large-scale cancer genome sequencing efforts would be fruitful in finding appropriate combinations of biological targets for cancer diagnostic and therapeutics.

However, as the next generation of genome sequencing technology becomes more accessible and affordable, much more efforts involving genome-wide sequencing of large number of tumor genomes will be conducted. Our work provides a conceptual and technical framework for incorporating the genome sequencing outputs and other types of data such as microarray profiles to get more insights into the cancer-signaling mechanisms that will facilitate the identification of key genes for biomarkers and drug development.

The cancer gene mutation frequency of a gene is defined as the ratio of samples containing the mutated gene to the total samples screened for that gene. In the database, about one-third of the literature-curated mutated genes (Cancer Gene Census genes) have nonzero mutation frequencies, suggesting that the literature curation of these genes (i.e., included them into the Cancer Gene Census) has been supported by one or more other independent experiments.

Analyzing the enrichment of the mutated and methylated genes in the network motifs
We mapped the mutated and methylated genes onto each type of the motifs. We then counted the number of mutated or methylated genes in each motif and classified each type of motif into several subgroups based on the number of nodes that are mutated or methylated genes. We then calculated the ratio (Ra) of the activation links to the total activation and inhibitory links in each subgroup.

) Oncogenic signal transduction events and oncogene-signaling-dependent events. (a) Signaling divergent unit. The line in red represents an oncogenic signal transduction event. (b) Signaling convergent unit. The line in red represents an oncogene-signaling-dependent event. In this case, both genes have high mutation frequency (⩾0.02), suggesting that the signaling event between the two genes is frequently used in tumorigenesis. Nodes in red represent mutated genes, whereas numbers represent mutation frequencies. Signs + and − represent activating and inhibitory links, respectively.

) Relations between the fractions of positive links in all 3-node-size network motifs and the fractions of methylated genes in these motifs. All network motifs were classified into subgroups based on the number of nodes that are either mutated genes or methylated genes, respectively. The ratio of positive links to total positive and negative links in each subgroup was plotted. The horizontal lines indicate the ratio of positive links to the total positive and negative links in all network motifs.



Figure 3
Human oncogene-signaling map. The human cancer-signaling map was extracted from the human signaling network, which was mapped with cancer mutated and methylated genes. The map shows three ‘oncogenic-dependent regions' (background in light gray), in which genes of the two regions are also heavily methylated. Nodes represent genes, whereas the links with and without arrows represent signal and physical relations, respectively. Nodes in red, purple, brown, cyan, blue and green represent the genes that are highly mutated but not methylated, both highly mutated and methylated, poorly mutated but not methylated, both poorly mutated and methylated, methylated but not mutated, and neither mutated nor methylated, respectively.

Figure 6
Correlation between the link number of a gene to the mutated genes and cancer-associated genes. We first classified the network genes (without mutations) into groups based on the number of the cancer mutated genes a gene links to. We then calculated the ratio of the cancer-associated genes to total genes for each group. The correlation between the ratio and the groups was plotted.
