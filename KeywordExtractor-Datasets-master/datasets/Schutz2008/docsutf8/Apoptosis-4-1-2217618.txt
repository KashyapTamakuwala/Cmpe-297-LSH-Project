Recombinant TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is considered a powerful and selective inducer of tumor cell death. We hypothesize that TRAIL’s potential as anticancer agent can be enhanced further by promoting its accumulation in tumor tissue. For this purpose, we developed TRAIL complexes that bind to angiogenic endothelial cells. We employed an avidin–biotin pretargeting approach, in which biotinylated TRAIL interacted with RGD-equipped avidin. The assembled complexes killed tumor cells (Jurkat T cells) via apoptosis induction. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the association of the RGD-avidin-TRAIL complex onto endothelial cells enhanced the tumor cell killing activity. Endothelial cells were not killed by TRAIL nor its derived complexes. Our approach can facilitate the enrichment of TRAIL onto angiogenic blood vessels, which may enhance intratumoral accumulation. Furthermore, it offers a versatile technology for the complexation of targeting ligands with therapeutic recombinant proteins and by this a novel way to enhance their specificity and activity.

]. It seems therefore attractive to design clustered TRAIL variants with enhanced specificity for tumor tissue. The increased tissue retention of cellular targeted TRAIL variants may counterbalance or prevent side effects elsewhere in the body. In the present paper, we investigated the development of TRAIL complexes equipped with targeting ligands directed to the tumor vasculature. Enhanced retention of TRAIL complexes at the tumor vasculature will enhance their accumulation in the tumor tissue, thereby favoring the desired therapeutic activity and reducing potential toxicity.

The approach presented in this paper differs to the above-discussed strategies in several aspects. First, we now equipped TRAIL with targeting ligands directed to angiogenic endothelium rather than to tumor cells, allowing an enhanced binding to the tumor blood vessels. The vascular wall is in direct contact with the systemic circulation, which makes it an easily attainable target for therapeutic proteins. Furthermore, intratumoral pressure, which hampers the penetration of macromolecules into tumor tissue will not affect the homing to of RGD-equipped complexes to the angiogenic endothelium.

Materials and methods
Preparation and characterization of RGDPEG-avidin
Avidin was modified with heterobifunctional PEG groups that can react with primary amino groups in avidin, after which RGD-peptide groups can be conjugated to their distal ends. The hydrophilic PEG groups of 3.4 kDa will furthermore reduce non-specific protein interactions.

The peptide was added drop wise to the reaction mixture at a molar ratio of 55:1, after which freshly prepared hydroxylamine was added to a final concentration of 50 mM. The reaction was carried out overnight at room temperature while protected from light. Remaining VNS groups were quenched by addition of cysteine (55:1 molar excess over the amount of avidin), after which the product was purified by size exclusion chromatography on a Highload superdex 200 column (Amersham Biosciences), pre-equilibrated in PBS. The final product RGDPEG-avidin was stored in PBS at −20°C.

Such an alternative strategy may prove less harmful to the therapeutic activity of TRAIL, depending on the extent to which side chain residues in the active domains are modified. Biotin-ULS was provided by Kreatech Biotechnology (Amsterdam, The Netherlands). All syntheses were performed in a 10:1 molar ratio of biotinylation reagent over TRAIL.
His-TRAIL in storage buffer was extensively dialyzed against PBS containing 10% glycerol at 4°C using Slide-A-Lyzer dialysis cassettes (10,000 MWCO, Pierce) to remove DTT and other components of the storage buffer that can interfere in the reactions. Typically, the purified His-TRAIL (500 ug, 7.6 nmol) at 0.7 mg/ml was mixed either with Sulfo-NHS biotin (Pierce) (10 mg/ml in DMF) or with biotin-ULS (10 mg/ml in 20 mM NaCl), after which the mixtures were incubated for 4 h at 37°C. Unreacted biotinylation reagent was removed by dialysis against PBS at 4°C. The products were sterilized by filtration via disposable 0.2 μm filters and stored at −20°C.
Biotin-TRAIL conjugates were characterized for protein content using BCA protein assay (Pierce). The relative number of coupled biotin molecules was determined by anti-biotin ELISA. Wells were coated with serial dilutions of the biotinylated proteins for 1 h at room temperature, washed with PBS containing 0.05% Tween20 and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with streptavidin-peroxidase complex (Dako, 1:2500 in PBS), followed by a standard incubation with OPD. The protein concentration at which 50% of the maximum absorbance was measured (EC50) was calculated by nonlinear regression (Graphpad Prism), and used to calculate relative biotin:protein ratios in each conjugate. The grade of biotinylation was furthermore assayed by MALDI-TOF analysis as described above for RGDPEG-avidin.

Complexation of biotinylated TRAIL with RGDPEG-avidin
We studied the complexation of biotinylated TRAIL with RGDPEG-avidin in an ELISA-like experimental setup. Wells were coated with 50 ng of avidin or RGDPEG-avidin overnight at room temperature, blocked with BSA (1% in PBS) and incubated with 10 ng of biotinylated TRAIL for 2 h at room temperature. After the wells were washed with PBS/0.05% Tween20, the amount of TRAIL associated with the avidin was detected by anti-TRAIL immunodetection (anti-TRAIL antibody 2E5, Alexis, Breda, The Netherlands) for 1 h, followed by standard detection with GARPO/OPD.

Apoptotic activity of biotinylated TRAIL
The apoptosis inducing activity of the biotinylated products was evaluated on Jurkat T cells and on endothelial cells, using a cell viability assay and a caspase activity assay. Experiments were conducted with the single cell types, Jurkat tumor cells or HUVEC, or with a combination of tumor and endothelial cells.

A striking result was observed when the excess of RGDPEG-avidin was removed before addition of TRAIL and Jurkat cells, leaving only endothelial-associated RGDPEG-avidin available for complexation with biotinylated TRAIL. This procedure significantly potentiated the proapoptotic effect for both Bio-NHS-TRAIL and Bio-ULS-TRAIL, the latter even beyond the activity of unmodified TRAIL.


Discussion
In the present study we describe the development and functional evaluation of RGD-avidin:TRAIL complexes. These targeted complexes of TRAIL showed enhanced binding to endothelial cells and maintained their pro-apoptotic activity. As a result of the binding to angiogenic endothelial cells of these complexes, an improved tumor accumulation and enhanced residence within tumor tissue can be expected. Such an improvement in the pharmacokinetic profile of TRAIL may further enhance its therapeutic efficacy and enable a reduction in dosing frequency.

]. Therefore, the most likely binding site for biotin-ULS is the methionine in the HIS-tag of the recombinant protein. In contrast, most lysine residues are readily accessible, including ones at positions that will interface with the Death receptor. This could explain why Biotin-ULS-TRAIL better maintained its proapoptotic activity than biotin-NHS derivatized TRAIL. Whether the greater loss in activity of biotin-NHS-TRAIL is due to the relative higher extent of derivatization or to modifications of lysine residues in the activity domains of protein can not be concluded from our data.

 integrin. Homing to the tumor vasculature will provide elevated concentrations within the tumor microenvironment, which may subsequently provide elevated intratumoral concentrations. Together with the observed enhancement of TRAIL activity, this may favor a more efficient induction of apoptosis in tumor cells.
To summarize, we have prepared a novel type of RGD-targeted TRAIL with binding specificity for angiogenic endothelium and maintenance of strong cytotoxic activity. Whether in vivo application of this product  will lead to an enhanced tumor accumulation still needs to be investigated. We now succeeded in coupling the well known homing device RGD to the TRAIL molecule, without losing the apoptosis-inducing activity of TRAIL or the receptor-binding properties of RDG peptides. An enhanced activity could even be demonstrated in vitro. This may, in combination with an improved pharmacokinetic profile induced by the PEG and RGD moieties, lead to improved effects of TRAIL in vivo. Lastly, the followed synthetic approach offers opportunities for the complexation with alternative targeting ligands that bind directly to tumor cells, such as tumor-specific antibodies or peptide ligands.
