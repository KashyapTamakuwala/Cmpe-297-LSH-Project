Purpose
ApoSense
, that is capable, upon systemic administration, of selectively targeting and accumulating within apoptotic/necrotic cells and is suitable for attachment of different markers for clinical imaging. The purpose of this study was to test the applicability of these molecules as a diagnostic imaging agent for the detection of renal tubular cell injury following renal ischemia.

Methods
ApoSense

Results

ApoSense
ApoSense
 targeting was demonstrated by its localization to regions of apoptotic/necrotic cell death, detected morphologically and by TUNEL staining.

Conclusion
ApoSense
 technology should have significant clinical utility for real-time, noninvasive detection of renal parenchymal damage of various types and evaluation of its distribution and magnitude; it may facilitate the assessment of efficacy of therapeutic interventions in a broad spectrum of disease states.

]. Moreover, these tests remain qualitative rather than quantitative markers of injury. Since therapeutic interventions might differ at various points in the evolution of ATN, advanced techniques are required to noninvasively follow the dynamic status of tubular injury. Furthermore, a technology that enables imaging endpoints, instead of time-consuming dissection and detection of renal parenchymal cellular damage, would be highly valuable.

Materials and methods
Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 180–250 g and 8- to 10-week-old C57Bl mice (Harlan Laboratories, Jerusalem, Israel) were used for these experiments. All experimental protocols were performed according to the Guiding Principles for Research Involving Animals, and approved by the local Animal Care Committee; the experiments described in this manuscript also comply with the current laws of Israel.

Four hours later, both kidneys, liver, gut, and blood samples were collected, weighed, and submitted to lyses by SOLVABLE reagent (GNE9100, Packard Bioscience), according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and sample radioactivity was determined using a beta counter (TRI-CARB 2100TR, liquid scintillation analyzer, Packard Bioscience). Both tissue uptake (% ID/g) and the ratios of the radioactivity of the ischemic kidney (DPM/g) to that of the contralateral kidney and the other non-target tissues were calculated.

The extent of damage was expressed as the percentage of necrotic tubules out of total tubules counted. Papillary necrosis was semiquantitatively assessed using a score of 0–3.

An additional four sham-treated animals were laparotomized, but the cecum was neither ligated nor punctured. Twenty-four hours later, mice were injected i.v. with DDC, and 2 h afterwards, kidneys were removed and subjected to fluorescence microscopy analysis as detailed above.

In addition, the biological rationale for engineering DDC, a small non-peptide molecule with a molecular weight of 700 Da (as compared with the 36-kDa annexin V protein), is that such small molecules could benefit from less immunogenicity and the favorable biodistribution kinetics that small compounds in general exhibit over bigger proteins.

ApoSense
 imaging would allow longitudinal studies in a single individual, rendering important information on the optimal timing and dosing of drugs and on the efficacy of therapeutic interventions.
