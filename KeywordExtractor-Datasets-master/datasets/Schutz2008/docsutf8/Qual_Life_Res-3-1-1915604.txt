n
 = 51 couples). Partners reported that their HD-patient spouses suffered more symptoms and experienced less control than the patients themselves reported. Illness perceptions of patients and partners correlated significantly with patient QoL. Partners’ beliefs in a long duration of the patients’ illness and less belief in cure, were associated with patient vitality scores. Suggestions for future research emphasize the importance of qualitative research approaches in combination with cognitive-behavioural approaches.

 perceptions of a short illness duration. From these studies it seems that both contrasting and concordant perceptions in couples can be related to better patient adjustment, and further study is needed to evaluate the extent to which spouses’ illness perceptions can influence outcomes which have been found to be related to the patient’s own perceptions.
Thus, the first aim of this study was to examine if patients and partners hold similar views about HD. Our second aim was to compare the relationship patterns between patients’ and partners’ own illness perceptions and QoL. The third aim was to contribute to the understanding of the cognitive factors related to QoL in couples dealing with HD, by examining which spousal illness beliefs are important in both patients’ and partners’ quality of life.

 = 1,450). The selection criteria for participation were the same as those applied to the patients selected from the Department of Neurology of the LUMC. A total of 41 patients and 71 spouses agreed to participate. No information could be gathered on non-participants due to the fact that members of the Dutch Huntington Association are not registered on the basis of their patient status. Members include HD patients and their partners, as well as their family members, friends, and researchers in the field of HD. A total of 51 couples (married or living together) were identified. Patients and their partners were interviewed separately at their homes by a psychologist.


Measures
Demographic variables
—HD patients and their partners were asked their age, sex, marital status, the duration of their relationship, number of children, their employment status, and the duration of HD.
Unified Huntington Disease Rating Scale
32
]—We used the motor section of the UHDRS to assess HD patients’ motor performance. The motor section is composed of 20 items rating ocular motor function, dysarthria, chorea, dystonia, gait, and postural stability. The Total Motor Score (TMS) is the sum of all the individual items, higher scores indicating worse motor performance (maximum score = 124).
Mini-Mental State

].
The Illness Perception Questionnaire

35
36
]. The “identity” scale was composed of 24 items, each corresponding to a symptom commonly reported in HD. Patients are asked to rate whether or not they have experienced each symptom since their illness began, and if they believe the symptom to be specifically related to their illness (yes or no). Partners were asked whether or not their partner (the patient) had experienced each symptom since onset of their illness, and to report if they believed the symptom to be specifically related to their partners’ illness (yes or no). The summed yes-rated items on the second questions were divided by the number of items to form the illness identity scale, with higher scores indicating a stronger belief that the experienced symptoms are part of the patient’s illness. Cronbach’s alpha for patients and partners was 0.88 and 0.82, respectively.
For the remaining scales, patients and their partners were asked to indicate whether they agreed with statements on a five-point scale, ranging from “strongly agree” to “strongly disagree”. The “Timeline” scale contained two statements about the perceived duration of the disease, with high scores indicating strong beliefs in a chronic long-term disease. Cronbach’s alpha for patients and partners was 0.45 and 0.72, respectively. “Consequences” consisted of five items assessing beliefs about the impact of HD on everyday life. High scores indicate stronger beliefs in serious consequences of the disease. Cronbach’s alpha for patients and partners was 0.69 and 0.61, respectively. High scores on the “Cure” scale (two items) indicate strong beliefs in the effectiveness of treatment. Cronbach’s alpha for patients and partners was 0.77 and 0.66, respectively. “Control” contained two items pertaining to the degree to which patients and partners believe they have the ability to influence the course of illness. Cronbach’s alpha for patients and partners was 0.85 and 0.83, respectively. The weight of all the items per scale were summed, and divided by the number of items, with the exception of those of the “Cause” subscale. Each item in this subscale was considered individually because each causal item represents a specific causal belief.
The Medical Outcome Study 36-item Short Form Health Survey
37
]—We assessed the QoL of HD patients, and the QoL of partners by means of seven subscales of the MOS SF-36 (“Physical functioning”, “Role functioning-physical”, “General health”, “Vitality”, “Social functioning”, “Role functioning-emotional”, and “Mental health”). The raw scores are transformed in order to obtain a 0–100 scale, with higher scores indicating a better outcome.
Analysis plan
t
t
-tests were computed.
To assess whether spousal illness perceptions are related to patients’ and partners’ QoL, we conducted hierarchical regression analyses with scores on the MOS SF-36 as criteria. For patients, illness related variables (disease duration, TMS, and MMS scores) were entered as control variables, prior to the steps containing the patients’ and partners’ scores on the IPQ (step 2 and 3, respectively). For partners, parallel analyses were conducted, but no control variables were entered. The variables for the regression analyses were selected based on an examination of bivariate correlations between the illness perception dimensions and the QoL scales.


Results
Sample characteristics
Couples recruited from the Department of Neurology of the LUMC did not differ significantly in demographic or illness related variables from couples from the Dutch Huntington Association. Further analyses were thus conducted on the combined data.
In total, 51 HD patients (28 males, 23 females) and their partners (23 males, 28 females) were included in this study. The mean age of both patients and partners was 51 years (SD = 10). Forty-seven couples were married and four were living together. The mean duration of the relationship was 25 years (range: 2–48 years), and the mean number of children was 2 (range: 0–6). Eight couples did not have children. Thirty-nine patients (76.5%) were unemployed, of which 28 (54.9%; 19 males, 9 females) stopped working because of HD, whereas 10 (19.6%; 6 males, 4 females) were still working, and 2 (3.9%; males) were retired and receiving pension. Thirty-four partners (66.7%; 19 males, 15 females) were employed, 15 (29.4%) were unemployed (for different reasons including marriage and childbearing; 5 females had never had gainful employment), and 2 (3.9%; males) were retired and receiving a pension. The mean duration of HD was 7 years (SD = 5; range: 1–24). Patients’ mean Total Motor Score (TMS) was 37.8 (SD = 29.5), and their mean score on the MMS was 23.5 (SD = 3.9).

The variance in patients’ scores on the other subscales of the MOS SF-36 was explained mainly by patients’ own IPQ scores, with the amount of added explained variance ranging from 9 to 20%. Less perceived consequences, a less strong illness identity, more control, and less belief in treatment contributed significantly to better QoL.

Most variance was explained by partners’ own IPQ scores, with amount of explained variance ranging from 16 to 21%. A longer perceived illness (and thus life) duration, and less perceived consequences contributed significantly to better QoL.


Discussion
15
], patients held more positive beliefs about HD than their partners did.
Examining the relationships between spousal illness perceptions and patients’ QoL, the results indicate that none of the partners’ perceptions (whether consonant or dissimilar) are relevant in being associated with patients’ quality of life in the areas of mental health and emotional role functioning. Partners’ identity and consequences perceptions (whether consonant or dissimilar) are not associated with patients’ quality of life in the areas of social functioning and vitality. Partners’ consequences perceptions (whether consonant or dissimilar) are not relevant for patients’ quality of life in the area of general health. Also, less partner (but not patient) belief in cure through treatment was related to higher patients’ vitality and social functioning ratings. Thus, our results suggest that except for patients’ physical functioning, it is of limited use to investigate (only) dissimilarities in illness perceptions of patients and partners as determinants of patient outcomes in HD.

]. Our results could, therefore, be instrumental in future research on quality of life in patients (and their partners) who are in these stages of HD. The relatively small number of couples included and the relatively large number of variables entered into the regression analyses must be taken into account as well.
