The development of paediatric intensive care has contributed to the improved survival of critically ill children. Physical and psychological sequelae and consequences for quality of life (QoL) in survivors might be significant, as has been determined in adult intensive care unit (ICU) survivors. Awareness of sequelae due to the original illness and its treatment may result in changes in treatment and support during and after the acute phase. To determine the current knowledge on physical and psychological sequelae and the quality of life in survivors of paediatric intensive care, we undertook a computerised comprehensive search of online databases for studies reporting sequelae in survivors of paediatric intensive care. Studies reporting sequelae in paediatric survivors of cardiothoracic surgery and trauma were excluded, as were studies reporting only mortality. All other studies reporting aspects of physical and psychological sequelae were analysed. Twenty-seven studies consisting of 3,444 survivors met the selection criteria. Distinct physical and psychological sequelae in patients have been determined and seemed to interfere with quality of life. Psychological sequelae in parents seem to be common. Small numbers, methodological limitations and quantitative and qualitative heterogeneity hamper the interpretation of data. We conclude that paediatric intensive care survivors and their parents have physical and psychological sequelae affecting quality of life. Further well-designed prospective studies evaluating sequelae of the original illness and its treatment are warranted.

Introduction

]. Consequently, new disease patterns have emerged due to long-term complications and effects of the original illness and its treatment. In addition to survival and morbidity, physical and psychological sequelae, as well as the quality of life (QoL) in survivors and in their families are important outcome measures.

].
Based on these observations, we believe that follow-up research of paediatric intensive care survivors and their families is needed to evaluate: (1) physical sequelae and their impact during growth and development; (2) psychological sequelae in patients and their families and their impact on the QoL of patients and family members; and (3) the need for treatment and support after discharge.
The aim of this article is to provide an overview of the available literature concerning the different domains of QoL (i.e. physical, psychological and social functioning) in children surviving paediatric intensive care, including the effect on parents, and to suggest directions for future follow-up research.

Methods
To identify studies eligible for this review, we searched Medline (1966–2006), EMBASE (1974–2006), CINAHL (1982–2006), pre-CINAHL and the Cochrane Library (2006) in March 2006. In the search strategy, all terms mapped to the appropriate MeSH/EMTREE subject headings and “exploded” were used; among them were: paediatric intensive care unit (PICU), septic shock, respiratory insufficiency, meningococcal disease, central venous catheterisation, intubation, physical and psychological sequelae, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), QoL, health status and long-term outcome.

Definitions
Functional health is defined as an individual’s ability to perform normal daily activities, to fulfil usual roles and to maintain health and well-being.

].

Study selection
Studies were selected for review if they met two inclusion criteria: (1) study of a representative population of PICU survivors (defined as a population consisting of medical and/or surgical PICU patients <18 years old) and (2) evaluation of physical sequelae, measurement of QoL or functional health >30 days after PICU discharge. Because of the limited number of studies, the measurement tools did not need to be standardised. Studies with a retrospective and prospective design were included.
Excluded were: (1) studies in homogeneous PICU populations (e.g. survivors of cardiothoracic surgery and trauma) reporting diagnosis-related outcome in particular but not intensive care treatment as such, and (2) studies evaluating mortality only.

Discussion
Only 27 studies consisting of 3,444 PICU survivors met our inclusion criteria. The small numbers, heterogeneity of the studied populations and the used measurement tools, the frequent use of non-validated measurement tools and the various aspects of outcomes studied make aggregation of the data and, therefore, strong conclusive statements difficult.

In conclusion, this review indicates that PICU survivors and their parents may have substantial physical and psychological sequelae interacting with QoL. Because of longer life expectancy, longer follow-up time is warranted, emphasising the consequences for health care in children. We believe that paediatric intensivists and psychologists should be involved as core members of follow-up teams.
