Previous reviews of massage therapy for chronic, non-malignant pain have focused on discrete pain conditions. This article aims to provide a broad overview of the literature on the effectiveness of massage for a variety of chronic, non-malignant pain complaints to identify gaps in the research and to inform future clinical trials. Computerized databases were searched for relevant studies including prior reviews and primary trials of massage therapy for chronic, non-malignant pain. Existing research provides fairly robust support for the analgesic effects of massage for non-specific low back pain, but only moderate support for such effects on shoulder pain and headache pain. There is only modest, preliminary support for massage in the treatment of fibromyalgia, mixed chronic pain conditions, neck pain and carpal tunnel syndrome. Thus, research to date provides varying levels of evidence for the benefits of massage therapy for different chronic pain conditions. Future studies should employ rigorous study designs and include follow-up assessments for additional quantification of the longer-term effects of massage on chronic pain.

Introduction

). More recently, massage therapy has been administered using mechanical devices in addition to hands-on treatment by therapists. Massage can be applied to single or multiple body parts or to the entire body. There are many different types of massage therapy including Swedish massage, Shiatsu, Rolfing, reflexology and craniosacral therapy. Most of the published trials on massage therapy have utilized Swedish or Swedish-type massage.
2
). It is hoped that by providing an overview of the field, gaps in extant research may be identified in order to inform future clinical trials.
3
). Following the methodology of the Cochrane Collaboration, the focus of this review will be on those studies in which massage for pain relief is delivered alone rather than as part of a treatment package, since it is difficult to draw conclusions regarding the effectiveness of massage when multiple treatments are involved. In addition, the emphasis of this review will be on randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs of massage therapy. As noted above, the main purpose of this article is to provide a broad overview of extant literature on the application of massage to a wide range of chronic pain conditions. Prior reviews have typically focused on a single pain complaint, even though many chronic pain patients present with multiple pain conditions. Thus, the current review summarizes the findings of existing reviews and meta-analyses as well as key individual studies that have appeared since the publication of these comprehensive reviews. Although this approach is limited as it depends heavily on the methodology used in extant reviews and the quality of the methodology likely varied across reviews, it was considered the most feasible approach in order to synthesize the large number of studies examining massage for a broad array of chronic pain conditions.
Table 6
.) It should be noted that a review of the findings from the handful of studies on mixed chronic pain problems is also included. Second, the results of a meta-analysis of massage therapy for pain complaints are discussed. This study was unusual in that it examined massage therapy effects across a number of pain complaints. The review concludes with a summary of the findings across the various chronic pain conditions, together with a discussion of putative mechanisms, clinical implications and recommendations for future trials.

Beneficial Effects for Subacute and Chronic Non-specific Low Back Pain
11
). The benefit obtained from massage exceeded that achieved from relaxation, education or acupuncture. However, the beneficial effects may be less than that provided by spinal manipulation or TENS. The Cochrane Review noted that there is insufficient evidence regarding the effects of massage on acute back pain and on specific forms of massage for chronic LBP.
Although the Cochrane review represents a synthesis of the most rigorous trials to date examining massage for LBP, it should be noted that the review based their conclusions on a relatively small number of studies. For example, their conclusions regarding the superiority of massage to relaxation and acupuncture were based on only a single study each, and therefore await further confirmation in future trials. On the other hand, the studies included in the review demonstrated therapeutic effects for massage that exceeded or equaled those obtained from various active treatment conditions. This level of evidence is more encouraging than that obtained from trials showing that massage is superior to no treatment or waitlist control.

Pain Management for Headaches from Massage Therapy

Table 2
). The Cochrane review concluded that there is moderate evidence that massage plus placebo laser is inferior to spinal manipulation for pain intensity and duration in relation to cervicogenic headache.

Table 2
). The number of migraine days did not vary across treatments. These findings suggest that massage may be superior to acupuncture for migraine headaches. But, because massage was combined with relaxation and other self-help techniques, it is not possible to draw definitive conclusions regarding the specific effects of massage based solely on these findings.

). The CV-4 technique moves with the narrowing and widening of the skull, or the cranial rhythm; the basis of the technique is the compression of the fourth ventricle. Sixty patients were randomly allocated to one of three conditions: (i) a 10 min session during which multiple still points were induced by the CV-4 technique; (ii) a 10 min session during which the head and neck were positioned according to the resting position technique; (iii) a 10 min no treatment control. Immediately following treatment, the CV-4 group reported less pain intensity and pain affect than the control group; there were no differences between the resting position group and controls.

Moderate Evidence for Cranioscaral Massage in Managing Tension-Type Headache Pain
21
22
23
). Because the aim of soft tissue manipulation is to alter mechanical stress caused by myofascial tissue disorders, the review concluded that massage techniques may therefore be an effective therapy for tension-type headaches. However, further large-scale studies are needed before conclusions regarding the effectiveness of massage for tension-type or other types of headaches can be drawn.

Shoulder Pain — Moderate Support for the Use of Massage Therapy
24
Table 3
); there were no significant differences between groups. The study authors concluded that both acupuncture and Trager were effective for shoulder pain in wheelchair users. In their meta-analysis of massage therapy effects (discussed subsequently) this study was included as evidence supporting the benefits of massage on the delayed assessment of pain (i.e. pain that is assessed following a period after which no treatment is delivered).

25
et al

) included a follow-up assessment. Finally, two of these studies compared massage with no treatment control. Additional studies are needed to determine whether massage therapy leads to improvements in shoulder pain when controlling for non-specific effects of treatment (e.g. increased clinician time/attention). Replication of these findings of these three studies in larger samples and with longer follow-up evaluation periods is warranted.

Comparison with Acupuncture for Neck Pain

Table 3
). Among the secondary measures, acupuncture showed more improvement than massage across most measures assessed immediately post-treatment. Nevertheless by 3-month follow-up, acupuncture was superior to massage only on spontaneous pain, global complaints and motion-related pain.

Effectiveness of Massage Therapy for Neck Pain Remains Unclear

31
), which also included a broad array of interventions such as traditional Chinese massage, ischemic compression, self-administered ischemic pressure using a J-knob cane, and occipital release, among others. The review authors noted that many of these approaches were of questionable value. The review concluded that no practice recommendations could be made since the effectiveness of massage for neck pain remains unclear.

Preliminary Support for Pain Relief in Carpal Tunnel Syndrome
32
Table 3
). Physician assessments of carpal tunnel symptoms also indicated significant improvements in the massage group versus no change in the control group.
The findings of this single study provide preliminary support for the application of massage to CTS. However, the sample size was very small, and it is unclear whether the physicians assessing the patients were aware of group assignment. Moreover, it is unclear to what extent patients practiced self-massage at home and whether the amount of massage administered was related to treatment response. Further work with larger samples and more rigorous study methodology are needed to determine the effectiveness of massage therapy for CTS.

Equivocal Support for Analgesic Effects in Fibromyalgia
33
Table 4
). The TENS group improved on this latter measure only. Limitations of this study include inadequate information regarding the interview items. Moreover, it was unclear whether interviewers and physicians were blind to patient group assignment.
34
Table 4
). No significant improvements were seen in the PMR group.
35
Table 4
). Brattberg maintained that there was a 37% reduction in pain following the massage treatment but that 30% of the improvement in pain had disappeared by 3-month follow-up and 90% of the reduction in pain was gone by the 6 month follow-up. Thus, it appears that the benefits of massage for fibromyalgia do not persist over the longer-term after the termination of active treatment. Brattberg recommended that following an initial treatment of 15 sessions, maintenance therapy may be instituted (e.g. once or twice per month).
36
). The massage group received 10 treatments of indeterminate length over 24 weeks.

), likely due to the small cell sizes.

35
). Replication of the positive results reported by the Field group in an independent research group would increase confidence in their findings.

Application to Mixed Chronic Pain Conditions
37
Table 5
). However, the study authors noted that their study was limited due to lack of equivalence across groups on demographic characteristics. Moreover, it is unclear whether the groups were similar in terms of the type of pain complaints represented or important clinical characteristics such as the duration and/or severity of pain.
38
). The massage group received 6–10 sessions lasting 30 min each; patients were treated 1–3 times per week. The relaxation group listened to the audiotape twice a week for 5 weeks. Although the massage group evidenced improvements in pain, mental energy and self-perceived health status compared with the relaxation group immediately following treatment, by 3-month follow-up, there were no differences between groups.
39
Table 5
).

Moderate Support for Short-term Benefits of Massage Therapy for Mixed Chronic Pain Conditions
These reports provide modest support for the immediate benefits of massage for a variety of chronic pain complaints. However, it appears that these treatment gains were not maintained following the end of active treatment. A potential difficulty with such studies including heterogeneous pain complaints is ensuring that treatment and control conditions are equivalent on key clinical and demographic characteristics. On the other hand, evidence of therapeutic effects across a variety of pain conditions supports the generalizability of the findings to a potentially broader group of patients. Future studies incorporating samples with mixed chronic pain conditions may also examine which types of pain conditions may benefit most from massage therapy in order to promote a more targeted approach to treatment.


Meta-Analysis — Massage Therapy Effects on Pain
30
et al
30
), immediate assessment of pain pertains to ‘single dose effects’ or short-term effects observed on the same day following massage therapy. The delayed assessment of pain reflects ‘multiple dose effects,’ which refers to outcomes that were assessed at various time points after treatment has been discontinued and following multiple sessions of massage. It should be noted that several of the studies included in this meta-analysis were also included in the Cochrane reviews discussed earlier in this article.

et al

39
). The latter two studies were published after the Moyer review was completed; it is unclear why the study on fibromyalgia was not included in the meta-analysis. Nevertheless, the rigorous approach employed by Moyer and colleagues, which expressly included the calculation of between-group effect sizes and the aggregation of data across numerous trials lends confidence to their overall conclusion that multiple applications of massage therapy appears to confer lasting benefits on pain. Their work did not however, speak to the time period over which such analgesic effects are maintained, or the rate at which such effects decay. These considerations warrant further examination in additional studies.


Discussion

3
), concluded that massage therapy may be beneficial for patients with subacute and chronic non-specific LBP, especially when combined with exercises and education. Whereas the evidence supporting the application of massage for LBP is fairly robust, there is less support for the use of massage for the other chronic pain conditions reviewed. This review suggests that the level of evidence for massage therapy effects by pain condition is (in order from most to least): LBP, shoulder pain, headache pain, fibromyalgia, mixed chronic pain, neck pain and CTS.

). Only one published trial has investigated massage therapy effects on CTS; this study found that massage was superior to no treatment. Based on these findings, there is only preliminary evidence to support the effectiveness of massage for both neck pain and CTS.

). There is little definitive data to support these major theories concerning the mechanisms underlying the analgesic benefits of massage.

Clinical Implications: The Application of Massage Therapy for Chronic Pain
3
). Thus, massage is not usually considered a first line treatment, but rather as a complement to other conventional first line approaches (e.g., physical therapy; medications). It should be noted that the studies reviewed above did not specifically report on findings regarding possible interactions of massage therapy with other CAM or conventional medicine approaches. Nevertheless, the increasing popularity of massage and the fact that it is typically used as an adjunctive approach with other established treatments suggests that massage may be successfully integrated into the treatment of a variety of chronic or recurrent non-malignant pain conditions. The paucity of data on negative side effects pertaining to massage does not necessarily mean that such effects do not exist. Future work should focus on systematically characterizing those patients for whom massage is not indicated.

Future Directions: Critical Issues for Studies on Massage Therapy for Chronic Pain
21
23
). In light of the contradictory findings noted above, future work may also continue to examine massage therapy effects on pain related to fibromyalgia which involves wide-spread, diffuse pain that is often not responsive to traditional approaches.
et al

). Thus, future research may also examine the optimal treatment schedule for delivery of massage therapy with a view to enhancing longer-term analgesic effects.

Limitations of the Current Review and Concluding Statements
The main limitation of the current study is its reliance on existing reviews and meta-analyses. Thus, many of the conclusions drawn in this article are based on the findings of other authors. Relatedly, the soundness of the methodological approach of these existing reviews may have been limited (e.g. due to improper exclusion of specific studies) as well as highly variable across reviews. Nevertheless, the reliance on extant reviews was considered necessary in order to synthesize a vast and diverse literature examining a broad array of chronic pain conditions. Another limitation of the present study is that only those pain conditions that were the subject of at least one controlled trial of massage therapy were included. Thus, not all chronic pain problems were examined in this review. It is possible that positive effects for massage therapy on other chronic pain conditions may have been reported in uncontrolled trials and/or case studies.
et al
30
) in their meta-analysis maintained that their positive findings for delayed assessment of pain are consistent with the notion that massage may promote pain reduction by enhancing restorative sleep. However, they note that data on sleep patterns was not included in the studies reviewed and therefore, this possibility remains to be tested. Thus, the careful consideration of potential mechanisms may inform future research, particularly with respect to the inclusion of key outcome variables as well as the examination of possible moderators and mediators of treatment response. Additional rigorous research is needed to establish massage therapy as a safe and effective intervention for the treatment of chronic, non-malignant pain.
