Summary
A fracture risk assessment tool (FRAX™) is developed based on the use of clinical risk factors with or without bone mineral density tests applied to the UK.

Introduction
The aim of this study was to apply an assessment tool for the prediction of fracture in men and women with the use of clinical risk factors (CRFs) for fracture with and without the use of femoral neck bone mineral density (BMD). The clinical risk factors, identified from previous meta-analyses, comprised body mass index (BMI, as a continuous variable), a prior history of fracture, a parental history of hip fracture, use of oral glucocorticoids, rheumatoid arthritis and other secondary causes of osteoporosis, current smoking, and alcohol intake 3 or more units daily.

Methods
Four models were constructed to compute fracture probabilities based on the epidemiology of fracture in the UK. The models comprised the ten-year probability of hip fracture, with and without femoral neck BMD, and the ten-year probability of a major osteoporotic fracture, with and without BMD. For each model fracture and death hazards were computed as continuous functions.

) ranged from 0.2% at the age of 50 years for women without CRF’s to 22% at the age of 80 years with a parental history of hip fracture (approximately 100-fold range). In men, the probabilities were lower, as was the range (0.1 to 11% in the examples above). For a major osteoporotic fracture the probabilities ranged from 3.5% to 31% in women, and from 2.8% to 15% in men in the example above. The presence of one or more risk factors increased probabilities in an incremental manner. The differences in probabilities between men and women were comparable at any given T-score and age, except in the elderly where probabilities were higher in women than in men due to the higher mortality of the latter.

Conclusion
The models provide a framework which enhances the assessment of fracture risk in both men and women by the integration of clinical risk factors alone and/or in combination with BMD.

Where interactions noted in the “mega-analyses” were no longer significant for both hip fracture and other osteoporotic fractures, these were omitted in a step-wise manner by dropping the interaction with the largest p value. For the death hazard, all significant interactions for fracture risk were included and thereafter omitted if appropriate in a step-wise manner, as described for the fracture hazard.

Whereas there is strong evidence for the association of these disorders and fracture risk, the independence of these risk factors from BMD is uncertain. It was conservatively assumed, therefore, that the fracture risk was mediated via low BMD, but with a risk ratio similar to that noted in rheumatoid arthritis. From an operational view, where the field for rheumatoid arthritis is entered as ‘yes’, a risk is computed with and without BMD. If the field for other secondary osteoporosis is also filled as ‘yes’ this does not contribute to the calculation of fracture probability. Conversely, where the field for rheumatoid arthritis entered as ‘no’, and the field for secondary osteoporosis is ‘yes’, the same β coefficients as used for rheumatoid arthritis contribute to the computation of probability where BMD is not entered. In the presence of BMD, however, no additional risk is assumed in the presence of secondary osteoporosis, since its independence of BMD is uncertain.

, the 10-year hip fracture probability was 1.3%. With one clinical risk factor, the probability ranged from 1.7% to 3.2%, depending on the risk factor. With two risk factors, the range was 2.5–6.6%, and with 3, 4 and 5 risk factors the ranges were 3.8–11%, 6.7–17% and 13–24%, respectively. In the presence of all six clinical risk factors, the 10-year probability of hip fracture was 30%.

), the difference in probability between men and women was less evident. For example, the hip fracture probability ratio (women/men) with glucocorticoid use was 1.8 in the absence of BMD but 0.9 at a T-score of −2.5 SD. In the case of all major osteoporotic fractures, probabilities remained higher in women than in men at a T-score of −2.5 SD but the difference in probabilities between men and women was less marked.

The present model has several unique features. FRAX™ uses Poisson regression to derive hazard functions of death and fracture. Such hazard functions are continuous as a function of time, unlike Cox’s regression for which the corresponding hazard functions are zero except at the time points of a fracture or death. There are also several advantages of the Poisson model over logistic regression analysis. Logistic regression does not take account of when a fracture occurred, nor whether individuals without a fracture died or when death occurred. Secondly, for the assessment of 10-year probabilities by logistic regression, the observation period should be for 10 years. Moreover, information longer than the 10-year period cannot be used for analysis. The cost of ignoring information when fractures occur and whether and when deaths occur is on the precision of the estimate. In simulation experiments, the Poisson model gives the same precision as logistic regression with fewer numbers of individuals. In our own simulations in the present context (data on file), the Poisson model gave the same precision as logistic regression with half the number of individuals. Finally, the Poisson model allows adjustments to be made for time trends. The ability to use several Poisson models permits the use of data from different sources to integrate fracture and death hazards, and to calibrate to different countries.

), in part related to the higher mortality associated with the lower values for BMD.
There are several limitations that should be mentioned. As with nearly all randomly drawn populations, non-response bias may have occurred. The effect is likely to exclude sicker members of society, and may underestimate the absolute fracture risk for example by age. The analyses also have significant limitations that relate to the outcome variables and the characterisation of risk factors. The definition of what was considered to be an osteoporotic fracture was not the same in all cohorts, but the effect of this inconsistency is likely to weaken rather than strengthen the associations that were found. For the hip fracture outcome, the definition was similar in all cohorts, and may explain in part the higher risk ratios associated for this fracture rather than for osteoporotic fracture. Also, the analyses were confined to clinical fractures, and the results might differ from vertebral fractures diagnosed by morphometry or as an incidental radiographic finding.
91
]. The use of maximal attained height, rather than current height, might be a solution in the future, if it were shown that fracture risk prediction could be improved.
92
93
]. Given that these studies were prospective, however, much of this error (with the exception of alcohol intake) should be random, giving rise to non-directional misclassification. Thus, the associations may actually be stronger than reported here. Any underestimate may have limited consequences for case-finding, since the populations to be tested are similar to the populations interrogated. Biases that arise have more significance where causality is inferred.
14
94
95
]. These limitations are nearly all conservative.
It should be acknowledged that there are many other risk factors that might be considered for incorporation into assessment algorithms. These include BMD at other skeletal sites, ultrasonography, quantitative computed tomography and the biochemical indices of bone turnover. The available information was too sparse to provide a meta-analytic framework, but they should be incorporated into risk assessment algorithms when they are more adequately characterised. Notwithstanding, the present model provides a mechanism to enhance patient assessment by the integration of clinical risk factors alone and/or in combination with BMD.

]. For all these reasons, it is important to define intervention and assessment thresholds on a country by country basis that takes into account the setting for service provision and willingness to pay, as well as considerations of absolute costs.

The basic relationship between 10-year probability and the hazard functions of death and of hip fracture includes an approximation. The hazard function of hip fracture or death, g(x), is approximately equal to the sum of the hazard functions of hip fractures and of death, g(x) ≈ h(x) + d(x). Indeed g(x) is somewhat less than the sum of the two functions because when a hip fracture causes death, both will contribute to the right side of the relationship but only the hip fracture to the left side, so the approximation gives an underestimation of the probability.
