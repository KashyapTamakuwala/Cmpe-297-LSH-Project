Conclusion
: Although protein-trafficking disorders are clinically heterogeneous and represented in almost every subspeciality of pediatrics, the identification of common pathogenic mechanisms may provide a better diagnosis and management of patients with still unknown Rab cycle defects and stimulate the development of therapeutic agents.

In the active state, Rabs interact with structurally and functionally diverse effectors, including cargo sorting complexes on donor membranes, motor proteins involved in vesicular transport and tethering complexes that regulate vesicle fusion with acceptor membranes

]. SopE has GEF activity for Rab5a, stimulating activated GTP-bound Rab5a and preventing its membrane extraction by RabGDI. A general conclusion that can be drawn is that parasites recruit endocytic Rabs to prevent or delay the formation of the degradative phagolysosome in the host organism.
Viruses enter host cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis, but they usually escape from endosomal vesicles to enter either the cytosol or the nucleus where they replicate. The binding of hepatitis C virus (HCV) non-structural protein (NS) with Rab1 GTPase-activating protein suggests that viruses are able to subvert host cell machinery in this way because this binding is necessary for HCV replication.

Conclusion
The Rab GTPases are a large family of proteins with a variety of regulatory functions in membrane trafficking. The central role of these proteins has become clear during the past decade, as part of the progress that has been made in understanding in detail the mechanistic principles of transport vesicle formation, movement, and fusion. Sequencing of the human genome has enabled researchers to realize the diversity of the Rab gene family, although the functions of the majority of the gene products are still unknown. The availability of complete genomic sequences as well as the important advances in molecular and cell biological methods that have already been made hold the promise of significant progress being booked in our understanding of Rab function in the near future. The identification of further genes involved not only in monogenic but also in common multifactorial human vesicle-trafficking disorders will result in a better understanding of this complex transport pathway but, more importantly, will also lead to opportunities to develop novel treatments.
