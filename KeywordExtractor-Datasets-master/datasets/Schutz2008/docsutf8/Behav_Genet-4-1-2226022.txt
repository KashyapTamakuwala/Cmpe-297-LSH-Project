 = 708) of twins were used to evaluate assortative mating for the three fear dimensions. Results showed that there was no assortative mating for blood-injury, social and agoraphobic fear. Resemblance between biological relatives could be explained by additive and non-additive genetic effects for blood-injury and agoraphobic fear in all participants, and social fear in participants aged 14–25 years. For social fear in participants aged 26–65 only additive genetic effects were detected. Broad-sense heritability estimates ranged from 36 to 51% and were similar for men and women.

To summarize, most studies report no sex differences in the heritability of fear and phobia while some do suggest qualitative sex differences based on the DOS and DZ correlation structure.

). Data were also available for a subsample of spouses of twins which were used to estimate the correlation between spouses to examine whether there is evidence for assortative mating. Since the determinants of phobic fear in adolescence and young adulthood may differ from those in later life, we divided the dataset into two age cohorts so as to test for differences in heritability between the two cohorts. In addition, we tested for qualitative and quantitative sex differences in the etiology of phobic fear.
To summarize, in this report, we address the following questions. First, is there spousal similarity for blood-injury, social and agoraphobic fear? Second, what are the heritability estimates for these three subtypes of fear? Third, are there sex and age differences in the heritability estimates of these subtypes?

). The FQ contains 15 items that tap phobic avoidance in three domains: blood-injury fear (e.g., avoidance of hospitals), social fear (e.g., avoiding talking to people in authority), and agoraphobic fear (e.g., avoiding large, open spaces). Each domain is represented with five items. Subjects were instructed to indicate on a nine point scale (0 ‘would not avoid it’ to 8 ‘always avoid it’) how much they would avoid certain situations because of fear or other unpleasant feelings. Scores were summed across subscales to obtain scores for blood-injury fear, social fear, and agoraphobic fear. A score was only calculated if at least four out of five items of a subscale were answered. Missing answers and double entries were substituted by the mean item score. We checked the factor structure of the FQ in our sample. All items of the FQ were analyzed with PCA with promax rotation in SPSS. Analyses were done separately for the two time points with random selection of one person per family. At both time points we found the original three factor solution in our data which accounted for around 47% of the variance.

Twin-family Studies
Twin studies make use of the genetic relatedness of twins and their family members to address questions about the etiology of population variation. Monozygotic (MZ) twins are genetically (nearly) identical. Dizygotic (DZ) twins and siblings share on average 50% of their segregating genes. Additive genetic effects (A) are suggested if the correlation for a phenotype in MZ twins is larger than the correlation in DZ twins and siblings. When the DZ correlation is more than half the MZ correlation, this indicates environmental effects shared by members from the same family (C). When the DZ correlation is less than half the MZ correlation, this can be taken as evidence for non-additive genetic effects (D). Non-additive genetic effects can consist of interactions between alleles within a locus (dominance) or across different loci (epistasis). Differences in fear scores within MZ twin pairs are due to unique environmental influences (E), which also include measurement error. The observed variance in phobic fear can thus be decomposed in four possible sources of variance; A, C, D, and E. However, the observed variances and covariances only provide enough information to test either an ACE model or an ADE model. Based on the pattern of twin correlations (see results section), A, D, and E were modelled in this study.

). Twin and sibling correlations were constrained to be equal at the two time points. For each fear subtype (blood-injury, social, and agoraphobic fear) and within each age group (14–25 and 26–65 years), we estimated five twin correlations (one for each sex by zygosity group) and three sibling correlations (male–male, female–female, and male–female sib pairs). Two cross-time within person correlations (one for each sex) and eight cross-twin cross-time correlations (one for each of the five sex by zygosity and the three sib pair groups) were estimated for each trait (not reported in the results section). Thresholds were estimated separately for men and women at each time point. The spouse correlations (Spearman’s correlation coefficients) were calculated using SPSS 12.0 for windows.
First, we tested whether the resemblance in sibling pairs was the same as in dizygotic twin pairs. Next, quantitative sex differences were investigated by constraining the correlations for same-sex male twin pairs and same-sex female twin pairs to be equal. Qualitative sex differences were investigated by constraining the correlations for DZ same-sex twin pairs and DZ opposite-sex twin pairs to be equal.
In a genetic model, the influence of latent factors A, D and E on the phobic fear score in 1997 and 2000 was estimated by the parameters (factor loadings) a, d, and e. The estimates for a, d and e were constrained to be equal in 1997 and 2000 for all three fear subtypes because we assume that the same etiological mechanism influences phobic fear at both time points. Correlations between the latent A and D factors were fixed at 1 for MZ twins. For DZ twins and siblings, the correlations between the latent A factors were fixed at 0.5, because they share on average half of their segregating genes. Dominant genetic effects result from the interaction or combination of alleles at a particular locus. Offspring receive only one allele from each parent and not a combination of two alleles. Parents and offspring share on average half of their genes so the chance that two siblings receive the same allele is 0.5 × 0.5 resulting in a correlation of 0.25 between the latent D factor for DZ twins and sibling pairs.
We first tested whether a, d and e in the two age groups could be constrained to be equal. Next, different models (ADE, AE and E) were fitted to the data to test which sources of variance contribute to individual differences in phobic fear.

 shows the distribution of fear scores in 1997 for males and females aged 14–25 and aged 26–65. The 2000 scores (not presented here) show a similar pattern. Women had significantly more often high scores on each fear dimension than men in each age group, except for blood-injury fear in the oldest age group for which there was no difference between men and women. There was no effect of age on the distribution of fear scores, except for women’s scores on blood-injury fear, which were significantly higher in the youngest age group.

Comments
This is the first study that explored the genetic and environmental contributions to individual differences in blood-injury, social, and agoraphobic fear using an extended twin design. We tested whether there was evidence for assortative mating, for a specific twin environment, and if the impact of the genetic and environmental factors differed between men and women and between two age cohorts.

These data do not indicate a lower familial correlation in opposite-sex relatives.

), it is important to replicate the findings in clinical samples. Second, data of our study were obtained with an instrument (i.e., the FQ) that primarily focuses on self-reported avoidance behavior related to a limited number of fear categories and our results may not be generalized to other specific fears such as fear of small animals.
In summary, we found random mating for blood-injury, social and agoraphobic fear. Individual differences in blood-injury fear and agoraphobic fear in both age groups and social fear in the youngest age group (14–25 years) could be explained by additive and non-additive genetic factors and unique environmental factors, while individual differences in social fear in the oldest age group (26–65 years) could be explained by additive genetic and unique environmental factors. The heritability of the three fear subtypes was similar for men and women and no effects of sex-specific genes were detected.
