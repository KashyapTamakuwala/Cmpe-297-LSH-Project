 plants in the absence and presence of herbivores. Growing induced and uninduced plants in the absence of herbivores allows for a quantification of possible costs of induced resistance, simulating localized damage (e.g., by small herbivores with a low mobility) and the activation of defense in ramets beyond the feeding range of the herbivore. Benefits of induction, however, can only be assessed in the presence of herbivores after an initial attack, thereby simulating a scenario with mobile herbivores showing active foraging behavior beyond the first place of attack.
In this study we tested the following specific hypotheses:
In the absence of herbivores, systemically induced ramets of clonal plants perform worse than uninduced ramets of the same genotype. This is due to costs of defense induction when defense is not needed.

In the presence of herbivores, induced ramets of clonal plants perform better than uninduced plants, due to an enhanced protection through induced defense.

Materials and methods
Study organisms
T. repens
 L. were vegetatively propagated in a greenhouse at a mean temperature of 21°C/19°C (day/night), and at a 16 h/8 h (light/dark) photoperiod. The genotypes originated from natural riverine grassland populations situated along the river Waal, The Netherlands. They had been collected 4 years prior to the start of this experiment and were grown under common garden conditions, eliminating possible maternal and environmental carry-over effects.

Pre-growth of plant material
We started the experiment with 64 cuttings of each of the five genotypes. The cuttings were planted in pairs in plastic trays (16 cm × 12 cm × 5 cm) using sterilized clay grains as a substrate (Seramis; Masterfoods, Germany). Each tray was fertilized weekly with 50 ml full-strength Hoagland solution before the start of the experiment. At the beginning of the experiment, all cuttings consisted of a main stolon with at least eight fully developed ramets. If present, side branches were removed immediately before starting the experiment.

 (S. Gómez, unpublished data). The induction treatment started 1 day after the cuttings were placed into the competition tray. If the caterpillar inside the petri dish died, it was replaced by a new one to maintain defense induction.
In order to enhance plant interactions, induced and control plants were grown together in the competition tray. Since all plants growing together belonged to the same genotype, induction effects cannot be confounded with genetic differences in plant traits, including competitive ability, between induced and control plants. All measurements described below were performed on ramets growing in the competition trays.

Costs of SIR
Costs of defense induction were measured as a reduction in plant performance. Costs can be measured after initial herbivore damage (and consequent defense induction) in the absence of subsequent herbivore attacks. To quantify costs of defense induction we measured the following traits which are known to be closely related to plant performance and fitness: total biomass production, relative biomass allocation to leaves, petioles, stolons, and roots, number and length of the main and side stolons and number of ramets on the main and side stolons. We also measured the petiole length, petiole dry mass, leaf area, leaf dry mass of the fourth and fifth youngest ramets of each cutting.

Benefits of SIR
To quantify benefits of SIR we exposed the plants in the competition tray to a second, controlled herbivory attack (referred to as “herbivory treatment”). We released five fourth instar caterpillars on day 16 in the competition tray and then added two and three more on day 17 and 18, respectively, to achieve substantial levels of herbivore damage. The plants were harvested 19 days after the start of the experiment. We quantified benefits of induced resistance by scoring herbivory damage in the induced and in the control plants. At the time of harvesting each ramet on the main stolon was classified according to the leaf area consumed. We visually estimated the damage and assigned each ramet a damage category ranging from 0 to 3. The values corresponded to the following amounts of damage: 0 = no damage, 1 = 1–33%, 2 = 33–66% and 3 = 66–100% of leaf area consumed. We also recorded the position of the damaged ramet on the stolon to investigate possible intra-clonal variation in the damage pattern according to ramet age. In addition to the degree of damage, we measured the dry mass of leaves, petioles, stolons and roots in induced and control plants.

Costs of SIR
Repeated measures ANOVA was performed to test for costs of defense induction in number and length of the main and side stolons and number of ramets on the main and side stolons, relative biomass allocation to roots, stolons, petioles and leaves and petiole length, petiole dry mass, leaf area, leaf dry mass of the fourth and fifth youngest ramets. Defense induction (induced vs. control) was considered a within-subjects effect, and genotype was treated as a between-subjects effect. Absolute dry masses of roots, stolons, petioles and leaves were analyzed using two-way repeated measures ANOVA (within-subjects effect—defense induction; between-subjects effects—plant genotype and herbivory).

Benefits of SIR
The amount of damage in the herbivory treatment was assessed with doubly repeated measures ANOVA using ramet age and defense induction as repeated factors and genotype as main effect. The analysis included a profile analysis (SAS procedure GLM; profile statement) to test for differences in the degree of damage between adjacent ramets on the stolons. To correct for differences in the developmental stage of different cuttings we used only the six youngest ramets of each cutting in the damage analysis. All analyses were conducted with SAS 9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, N.C.).

), as we could not find a significant induction × herbivory interaction effect. However, we propose that the differences observed in our study (e.g., reduced ramet production rates and shorter petioles in the cost experiment, decreased amount of leaf damage in the benefits experiment) are likely to translate into substantial differences in plant productivity, and hence biomass, in the longer term.

 plants, which had previously been damaged by herbivores, were able to elongate stems to a similar proportional degree as undamaged plants when grown in competition for light. However, the damaged plants were smaller due to the expression of induced resistance, thereby incurring potential opportunity costs due to asymmetric competition.

 leaves is more detrimental than the same amount received by mature, fully developed leaves. As leaf tissue expanded, the area of the holes increased almost fourfold and the final area of the leaf decreased by approximately 40%. In addition, they observed a 35% decrease in the number and mass of fruits on the plants that received the damage to expanding young tissues. Therefore, an initially small amount of damage inflicted on young developing leaves may have dramatic consequences for plant performance and fitness over time. Similarly, the differences found in our experiment can be expected to result in considerable performance differences between induced and uninduced plants as increased damage and loss of young leaves in uninduced plants will compromise plant productivity by reducing the number of future source ramets.

. The experimental approach used in this study, however, does not allow for balancing costs and benefits in terms of plant fitness and overall plant performance, because both positive and negative effects of induction reported here, although likely to have significant longer-term effects on productivity and ultimately on fitness, did not have an effect on biomass at the short time scale during which the experiment took place. While our results indicate clear advantages and disadvantages of network induction in the subsequent presence and absence of herbivores, respectively, an accurate and reliable quantification of the cost–benefit ratio should make use of long-term experiments.
In conclusion, the present study shows that in the short term, the activation of early-warning responses in clonal plant networks has both costs and benefits. In the absence of herbivores, the performance of the induced phenotype was compromised as compared to the uninduced phenotype in terms of potential competitive ability. In the presence of herbivores, the induced phenotype was favored by suffering considerably less herbivore damage suggesting potential advantages for the phenotype correctly matching its environment. Whether this represents an adaptive value of the induced responses remains to be demonstrated in longer-term studies where the initial small changes observed in our study can be measured directly in terms of fitness. The long-term balance of costs and benefits of induced resistance in clonal plant networks is likely to be strongly context dependent and a function of the match between spatio-temporal aspects of systemic defense expression and the feeding behavior of herbivores.
