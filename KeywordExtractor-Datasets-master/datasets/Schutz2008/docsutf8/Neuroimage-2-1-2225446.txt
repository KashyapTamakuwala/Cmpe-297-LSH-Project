Abstract
Large, multi-site studies utilizing MRI-derived measures from multiple scanners present an opportunity to advance research by pooling data. On the other hand, it remains unclear whether or not the potential confound introduced by different scanners and upgrades will devalue the integrity of any results. Although there are studies of scanner differences for the purpose of calibration and quality control, the current literature is devoid of studies that describe the analysis of multi-scanner data with regard to the interaction of scanner(s) with effects of interest. We investigated a data-set of 136 subjects, 62 patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease and 74 cognitively normal elderly controls, with MRI scans from one center that were acquired over 10 years with 6 different scanners and multiple upgrades over time. We used a whole-brain voxel-wise analysis to evaluate the effect of scanner, effect of disease, and the interaction of scanner and disease for the 6 different scanners. The effect of disease in patients showed the expected significant reduction of grey matter in the medial temporal lobe. Scanner differences were substantially less than the group differences and only significant in the thalamus. There was no significant interaction of scanner with disease group. We describe the rationale for concluding that our results were not confounded by scanner differences. Similar analyses in other multi-scanner data-sets could be used to justify the pooling of data when needed, such as in studies of rare disorders or in multi-center designs.

), we did not find this to be an issue in our sample, possibly because the disease was early. We hypothesized that the changes due to AD pathology are large compared to scanner induced distortions and that there would be no interaction of scanner with case and/or control groups. In this paper, we report the results in our data-set and outline a method by which multi-scanner data-sets might be pooled with confidence.

). Scanners also underwent upgrades over time. Importantly, all scanners were monitored with daily phantom quality checks which calibrated the gradients to within ± 1 mm over a 200-mm volume centered at iso-center, monitored signal to noise and radio frequency (RF) transmit gain. The major hardware elements (body resonance module gradient coil and birdcage head transmit–receive volume coil) were unchanged throughout time and across scanners, except that for the oldest scanner (scanner 2), the wiring in the resistive shim set was not cooled to super conducting temperatures, whereas for the other 5 scanners, the shim coils were inside the dewar and were cooled to the superconducting range.

) was used to ensure that the overall amount of each tissue class was not altered by the spatial normalization procedure. Modulation was performed by multiplying the warped tissue probability maps by the Jacobian determinant of the warp on a voxel-by-voxel basis, which represents the relative volume ratio before and after warping, thus allowing voxel intensities in the segmented grey matter map, together with the size of the voxels, to reflect regional volume and preserve total grey matter volume from before the warp. Modulated grey matter scans were smoothed using a 6-mm full-width at half-maximum Gaussian kernel.

Discussion
In our data-set, we found the effect of disease to be substantially larger than the effect of scanner and failed to find a significant interaction of disease with scanner or software upgrades. In general, the effect of disease in AD is liable to be larger than the effect of scanner, which is supported by our result of no important interaction between scanner and effect of interest. Ideally, further studies with an even larger data set to better calculate the effect sizes and quantify the distance between the scanner effect cluster and group effect cluster could be done to validate our findings. However, comparison of the magnitude of the scanner effect versus disease effect in the medial temporal lobe cluster in our data-set demonstrates that scanner differences had minimal effects in the areas that are important in the study of AD. Furthermore, even though there are likely to be some differences among data from different scanners, our experiments were explicitly designed to detect scanner-related differences. By modeling appropriate confounds in the design matrix, it appears possible to remove these small effects. We were able to model this interaction easily because relatively homogeneous cases and controls were scanned in each machine. We are unable to say whether lesser or more subtle and distributed changes would be as resistant to scanner effects.
Though we did not detect a significant interaction of scanner with disease, we cannot be absolutely certain it is indeed due to the absence of such effect. The lack of significance may be a reflection of the lack of statistical power, e.g., insufficient number of scans. Other causes such as a high average residual variance or residual variance inhomogeneities could also under-power the detection of the effects. However, the variance inhomogeneity was considered in our analysis by assuming unequal variance for the different levels of each of the two factors in our full factorial design (the two factors are the scanner and group). In a post-hoc manner, we explored the residual variance across scanners to assess whether that explained the lack of sensitivity in the results. In the area of greatest disease effect, the variance was low and did not reflect significant inhomogeneity, but in the area of greatest scanner effect there was lower average residual variance and more variability. Though our tests for variance inhomogeneity across the 6 scanners was not voxel-by-voxel over the whole brain volume, our findings seem to support that the variance inhomogeneity is location-dependent and should be accounted for when analyzing data acquired from different scanners as we attempted to do in our analysis.
The greatest effect of scanner was in the thalamus. The effect of the thalamus was largely driven by the scanner with the resistive shim set that was not cooled to superconducting temperatures, which suggests an impact of such hardware differences on thalamic segmentation. The composition of the thalamus is an issue of debate as it is not completely grey matter receiving numerous white matter tracts from other parts of the brain. Additionally, the grey matter intensity value of the thalamus is different from that of cortical grey matter. The intrinsically poor intensity contrast in the thalamus renders it susceptible to small differences in image contrast due to scanner differences. There is also less variability in this part of the brain, so tests will be more sensitive to such differences. These factors may contribute to the difficulty of accurate segmentation of the thalamus in addition to scanner effects.
Preboske et al., 2006
). Even though it is common experience that current generation scanners are remarkably stable over time, they do still drift in a way that is correctable with judicious calibration. Though we collected no data to determine the frequency and level of sophistication necessary, basic calibration akin to the current standard in most major centers is likely sufficient. Furthermore, while it can be useful to collect data on inter-subject variability by scanning the same subjects in different scanners, such efforts would not directly answer the question of whether data from different subjects on different scanners can be pooled.
Ashburner and Friston, 2005
) produces an estimate of the tissue class intensities from a fitting of spatial priors to the image, which allows for differences in image intensities between scans. Additionally, any image intensity differences due to subject to subject variation in coupling of the RF coil to the head that may be introduced by different head shapes and sizes are likely to be well-accounted for by bias corrections in the unified segmentation algorithm.
As long as provision for different scanners and/or upgrades is made within an analysis, the effect of scanner regardless of magnitude is not likely to devalue the integrity of results. However, if there is a true physical interaction of the biological effect of interest with the method of measurement, perfect calibration or even using a single scanner would not prevent bias. On the other hand, any unusually large effect from one scanner would be attenuated by the totality of scans from different scanners that make up the template, which averages the different scanner effects for normalization.
Zakzanis et al., 2003; Whitwell and Jack, 2005; Wahlund et al., 2005
Zakzanis et al., 2003
). Although there may be concern about error introduced by the variability inherent in preprocessing many individuals across studies, automated VBM methods successfully overcome the problems to combine information from multiple scans and studies. VBM meta-analyses of pooled scans permit the usual range of analyses beyond simple categorical comparisons (e.g., regression, age interaction, subgroup, nonlinear, etc.).
a priori
 interaction analysis of scanner by biological effect to be studied to exclude scanner-specific compromising effects. Additional comfort can be gained by finding that the biological effect is of greater magnitude than any effect of scanner. An alternative approach is to model each scanner's effects separately, thereby permitting a principled meta-analysis on pooled data. That data can be pooled from different scanners without corroding the integrity of results is reassuring for large multi-site studies.
