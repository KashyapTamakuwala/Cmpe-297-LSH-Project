Sterilizer performance also was characterized over the expected range of operating conditions. Differences between design and observed temperature, pressure, and other profiles were quantified and investigated.

 (lpm)], is varied by adjusting flowrate and/or length of the holding loop.
Energy is recovered by pre-heating incoming cold medium from 15°C (worst case) to 120°C with outgoing sterilized medium that is cooled from its sterilization temperature of 150 to 45°C prior to entering the process cooler where it is cooled further to 35°C. Medium is recycled back to a circulation tank (also called a surge or recycle tank) or diverted to the sewer during start up or process upsets (such as a decrease in sterilization temperature or an increase in system flowrate). This circulation tank can be pressurized or non-pressurized with the non-pressurized design approach requiring a second “flash” cooler before returning flow to the recycle tank to avoid flashing. Heating is accomplished indirectly using steam or hot water via a heat exchanger (HEX) or directly by mixing steam with incoming medium (steam injection). Cooling HEXs can use cooling tower/chilled water, but also may use vacuum to reduce temperature and draw off any accumulated water from direct steam injection. Continuous sterilization systems typically are pre-sterilized with steam by direct injection and/or with hot water. After attaining steady state with water flow, non-sterile medium feed is introduced. Various media components are sterilized in aliquots and sent to the receiving fermentation vessel with water flushed between them.
A next generation, pilot-scale continuous sterilization system was designed, installed, started up, and validated. Demolition as well as retrofit was accomplished within an actively operating industrial pilot plant. Despite prior experience with a stick-built, internally designed system, a skid-mounted vendor design was selected consisting of five skids (recovery and heating exchangers, hot water loop and exchanger, retention loop, process and “flash” cooling HEXs, and switching valve station). Sterilized medium, obtained from the system at 40–100 lpm, typically was aliquoted into 800–19,000 L scale fermenters with lower flowrates being most appropriate for lower fermenter volumes. The design accommodated a range of different media types, including low solids levels below 5 wt.% and concentrated nutrient solutions.

], there have been few, if any, publications linking design and operation, despite the considerable and varied industrial applications of high temperature, short time (HTST) sterilization. This paper describes the design and testing of a next generation HTST continuous media sterilization system, along with the technical rationale behind its features and flexibility.

]. Time/temperature exposure profiles accurately reflect sterilization conditions for the media of interest and can be readily modeled. Finally, the ability to design heat exchange equipment to minimize fouling reduces cleanability and maintenance concerns.
Disadvantages of continuous sterilization primarily are that process control performance is critical since it is necessary to immediately divert flow of any inadequately sterilized medium, halt any further medium sterilization, and resterilize the system. In contrast, for a batch sterilization system upset, often additional hold time can be readily added to the sterilization. Continuous sterilizer systems also use dedicated equipment that usually is not well suited for other purposes.

Applications
Several relevant background papers on applications of continuous heat treatment of liquids have been published in the food, biowaste, and fermentation fields.

 of 965 min to assure sterility of the retention loop effluent). Loss of incoming water due to boiling while the system was at a lower backpressure was believed minimized by the nearly closed “flash” cooler backpressure valve (expected fill volume 1,215 L, actual volume 1,218 L).
During water sterilization, incoming cold water was circulated for two passes (one pass if system was already hot from steam sterilization) at 60 lpm using the centrifugal inlet feed pump, after it rose to the sterilization inlet hold temperature of 150°C. It required previously steamed-through system block/drain valves since users were not comfortable that conduction adequately sterilized through them when closed. The non-sterile side of the recuperator HEX was bypassed to ensure that the sterile side reached sterilization temperature. Cooling water was applied to the “flash” cooler to ensure that the process cooler attained sterilization temperature. For the target sterilization temperature of just below 150°C and a 60 lpm water flowrate, the temperature reached about 148.5°C at the sterile side of the recuperator and 146.5°C for the sterile side of the process cooler.
Water sterilization was redone during medium sterilization if medium diversion was necessary owing to system sterility upset. After taking immediate action to divert media away from the production vessel, water re-sterilization was conducted by (1) diverting flow through the “flash” cooler and enabling its pressure control loop, (2) fully opening the process cooler back-pressure valve, (3) conducting water re-sterilization, (4) enabling the process cooler pressure control loop, (5) fully opening the “flash” cooler back-pressure valve, and then (6) resuming medium sterilization. When switching from the “flash” to the process cooler, it was necessary to maintain sterile conditions.
After the system was sterilized and running on water, typically in recirculation mode or emptying into the system sewer, the switching valve station was used to divert flow to distribution. Water now flowed to a waste vessel or the process sewer located near the eventual medium receiving vessel. After conditions stabilized, sterilizer inlet feed was switched from water to medium. Again, after conditions stabilized, flow was switched to the receiving vessel. When the receiving vessel was filled sufficiently, sterilizer effluent was switched back to the waste tank, sterilizer inlet feed was switched back to water, and then effluent switched back to either the recirculation vessel or system sewer. After media sterilization, a thorough water rinse was conducted at sterilization temperature and the system was cooled to 60°C for cleaning. Alkaline and/or acid cleaning solutions were used depending on the nature of the soil. After cleaning, the system was cooled and drained completely.

Equipment design
The system’s five skids were designed and fabricated at the vendor’s shop and delivered with only field installation of interconnecting piping required. To minimize design miscommunications, three-dimensional piping models were used for skid piping plans, which were able to be reviewed remotely by the customer. Ball valves were used instead of diaphragm valves for hot temperature service. Hazardous energy control was carefully considered with locking devices installed and valve placement selected for facile equipment isolation and operability. Equipment was citric acid-passivated after installation.
Each relief device on the process side consisted of a flanged rupture disc (RD) with a pressure indicator and telltale as well as a pressure safety valve (PSV) that reseated after the source of excessive pressure was removed. These devices were placed directly after the positive displacement Moyno (Robbins and Myers; West Chester, PA, USA) system inlet feed pump, recuperator outlet, and booster pump. Discharges were piped to return to the feed tank for safety as well as for medium recovery. Piping was designed such that no PSV devices were required on the process side to minimize risk of system integrity disruption. Sample points were located on the inlet feed (pre-sterilization, prior to recuperator) and sterilized medium outlet (post-sterilization, after process cooler) lines.

), i.e., the retention loop was assumed to be isothermal (adiabatic). The sensitivity of these three parameters to small temperature measurement errors of ±1°C for the expected temperature change of each HEX stream was estimated ±5.7% for NTU, +3.5/–12.5% for TE, and ±3.0% for HR.
Specific limiting performance case scenarios depend on media type and inlet feed temperature. Higher inlet feed temperature (60°C) is worst case for the cooling HEX since the recuperator removes less heat from sterile medium. Lower inlet feed temperature (15°C) is worst case for the recuperator since it represents the greatest challenge to HR.

These crevices were considered unavoidable, and they were accepted since they were shallow enough to permit adequate contact with sterilizing and cleaning fluids.

.
A sanitary design was utilized with a continuous sheet for coil formation, a tapered channel transition for the medium inlet and outlet, external bracing of shell connections, back-welding of the center pocket stiffener as much as possible, elimination of additional center stiffeners, and polishing/cleaning of all internal welds. Process connections were 150 psig bolted, milled, lap-joint flanges possessing a right angle rather than a bevelled edge to line up directly with the gasket and avoid crevices. A solid 316 L stainless steel door eliminated a process side weld around the center nozzle required to attach a stainless steel skin to a carbon steel door.

] or door covers if annular gaskets were utilized without a sufficient gap. Telescoping also was minimized by not applying pressure to one HEX side without either the opposite door bolted closed or suitable bracing installed on the open side. An annular gasket initially was selected which when placed in its groove provided a 1/16″ gap between the exchanger spiral surface and the door. At first, this gap was considered small enough so that any short-circuiting negligibly impacted performance, particularly the recuperator HR. Subsequently, the gap size was realized to be critical, especially for high aspect ratio (“pancake” type) HEXs like the recuperator. The smoothness and straightness of the spiral and door faces (tolerance of ±1/32″) also assured a consistent gap, minimizing bypassing, and maximizing heat transfer; HEXs were modified to be within this tolerance. Observed pressure drops during operation (150°C inlet retention loop temperature, 100 lpm water) approached design values for cases where this gap was minimized through installation of compressible gaskets. Both an annular gasket (Gylon 3510; Garlock Sealing Technologies, Palmyra, NY, USA) and a full-face gasket (Gylon 3545) were used to implement a full-face gasket installation with gasket material compressed so as to cut into the spiral face.
U
” shaped notches in each wind of the spiral from the center down to the door drain. These notches were expected to negligibly impact performance relative to the gap. The extent that gaps or notches remained when a pliable, full-face gasket was installed was estimated by qualitative assessment of HEX gravity draining rates, which corresponded to measured pressure drops closer to design values. For the HEX gaskets selected, the remaining water after gravity drain was 20–50% of the entire HEX hold up volume, suggesting only very small gaps. This water was removed by subsequent blow-down using a 90 psig air supply.

Hot water heating loop
A hot water or tempered heating loop involves indirect heating without direct steam contact, and it utilizes a HEX, expansion tank, and circulation pump to heat water to above 150°C. It is more expensive than direct steam injection since additional equipment is required, but hot water loops have some key advantages.

Based on its advantages for media sterilization, indirect heating via a hot water loop was implemented. A shell and tube 316 L stainless steel HEX was selected for this application since a spiral HEX was not found to be cost-effective for the size required. The hot water loop utility piping, originally carbon steel, exhibited substantial amounts of iron oxide corrosion due to its operation at higher temperatures. This build-up throughout the hot water loop was subsequently removed by a citric acid wash and piping was replaced by stainless steel. The hot water loop was designed for an operating temperature of up to 160°C and pressure of 75 psig using compressed air (>80 psig) applied to the expansion tank. Installation of a computer limit of 160°C for the loop temperature was necessary to avoid inadvertent system over-pressurization since the steam control valve opened fully during initial loop heat up.

Together with low heat loss over the insulated retention loop, this tuning strategy permitted operation at more uniform sterilizing temperatures. Thus, sterilization temperature effects on subsequent production media performance were quantified more precisely, and operation with a safety factor of several degrees was avoided.

Flow and pressure control

a). The system was designed to utilize either a positive displacement (Moyno) or centrifugal inlet feed pump. When the positive displacement pump was used, both flow control valves were held fully open and flow was controlled using the Moyno pump’s variable speed drive. When the centrifugal feed pump was used with the booster pump, booster pump suction pressure was controlled just prior to the booster pump suction and flow was controlled at the booster pump discharge only. (The flow control valve after the centrifugal feed pump was not used since this starved the booster pump suction).

Simultaneously with pathway switch, a steam barrier was applied to the pathway not being used to maintain sterility.
Isometric design of the switching station was challenging since several automatic valves with actuators were located in close proximity to reduce dead legs. Actuator size was minimized by sizing appropriately with little excess buffer for the facility instrument air pressure. Limit switches were avoided to save additional space as well as to streamline installation and maintenance costs.

Accurate measurement of volumetric flow was critical to ensuring that medium was properly sterilized for the appropriate residence time. A back-up flowmeter was installed for confirmation. Coriolis meters (Micromotion; Rosemount, Chanhassen, MN, USA), with a meter accuracy of ±0.5% of flowrate (loop accuracy of ±0.6% of flowrate), were selected rather than magnetic meters. Since flow measurements were based on fluid density, Coriolis meter readings were similar for both deionized and process (city) water (<±0.5 lpm at 60–100 lpm) and within expected variations. Coriolis meters also were insensitive to media composition changes, specifically the switch from media to water, assuming these changes negligibly affected fluid density and were not affected by the hydraulics of medium to water switches. However, volumetric flow rate readings were up to 5.5% higher after the recuperator than before it owing to density decreases with temperature for specific medium types. [Mass flowrate (kg/min) readings were similar]. Finally, since air bubble entrainment altered density readings and thus Coriolis flowmeter readings, a variable speed agitator (5:1 turndown) was installed on the larger non-sterile medium feed tanks. For soluble media, shutting off the agitation also minimized air entrainment.
Proper Coriolis flowmeter installation was critical to performance. The preferred orientation was in a vertical upward flow section of pipe so that the flag filled and drained completely. Alternatives were not attractive: in the horizontal position pointing downwards the flag does not drain, in the horizontal position pointing upwards the flag incompletely fills due to air entrapment, and in the vertical position in a downward flow section of pipe the flag incompletely fills owing to gravity drainage. It also was necessary to secure the surrounding pipe to minimize interfering vibrations.

], but this leak might have to be fairly substantial since cooling water and media conductivities are similar in magnitude.

Control system
Strategy
The control system strategy utilized minimal sequencing with manual operation preferred both to reduce installation expense and maximize flexibility. The system was composed of about 100 I/O (input/output) with about 55% analog input/output (AI/AO) and 45% digital input/output (DI/DO). The controls were interfaced to an existing Honeywell Total Distributed Control 2000/3000 hybrid system using newly-installed, dual (redundant) Honeywell High performance Process Manager controllers. Field-mounted (remote) I/O was installed inside a Nema 4× enclosure.

Calculated values by the control system
Several calculated values were displayed on the HMI to permit alarming and trending. These parameters included the temperature difference (inlet minus outlet) across the insulated retention loop, flowrate difference across the recuperator (upstream minus downstream), conductivity difference (inlet minus outlet), and pressure difference across the recuperator (outlet of hot side minus inlet of cold side). In addition, the totalized volumetric flowrate was calculated based on flowmeter readings rather than using the flow transmitter totalizer signal since implementation of the former was more straightforward.

Slightly different values were optimal for flowrates of 40–60 lpm than for 80–100 lpm with lower flowrate range constants performing somewhat better than higher flowrate range constants between 60 and 80 lpm. Variations in these control loops, characterized under various operating conditions, were found to be acceptable. Hot water loop control performance did not change significantly with media type since system disturbances expected for media were likely to be dampened relative to water.



System performance
Water and media testing
The three types of media tested were water [both deionized (DIW) and process (city)], 55 wt.% cerelose and 50 vol.% glycerol. Heating of non-sterile feed tanks by external jacket platecoils and recycling of cooled effluent back to the system inlet permitted system testing with feeds of differing temperatures over the range of 15–60°C. “Once-through” testing was used only for cerelose to reduce Maillard reactions, which were feared to soil sterilizer internals. Water and glycerol were recycled by setting the “flash” cooler temperature to the desired inlet temperature, permitting testing of process cooler performance at or above inlet feed temperatures. The manner in which readings were taken affected assessment of their variability; readings were observed for a few seconds, then a mental average was taken and evaluated to determine whether the bounce was within reasonable limits. Computer system historical trends, which recorded data every 1 min also were used to assess variability.

Observed temperature profiles, HRs, NTUs, and TEs generally met or were somewhat lower than design depending upon which design basis was utilized. The primary factor causing under-performance was believed to be lack of allowance for the gap that was likely present even with pliable, full-face gaskets installed owing to unavoidable variations in flatness of the HEX spiral and door faces. The observed hot side recuperator inlet temperature from the non-adiabatic retention loop was lower than the isothermal design assumption and thus raised measured values compared with design HR, NTU, and TE. Viscosity decreases with higher temperature resulted in improved performance.
System draining hold up volume
The system’s hold up volume was established by running process water into a completely drained and air-blown system. It was determined when water reached a certain section by opening the adjacent downstream drain valve. Measured hold up volumes agreed with calculated ones within reasonable limits but may have been affected by the ability to fill the system completely at the lower flowrates used to obtain these measurements. Overall, the impact on design residence times of these differences was negligible, however.

Inlet feed stream and outlet distribution stream switching
Prior to testing all instrument air connections to the switching skid were checked for leaks and proper venting. When switching to the distribution manifold (sterilizer feed to fermenters) from either the sewer or recycle flow paths, transient flow and pressure spikes and their effect on inlet and outlet retention loop temperatures were observed and found to be negligible. When sterilizer distribution was switched from the receiving waste tank to the desired fermenter vessels, pressure spikes also had a negligible effect on temperature. Minimal disturbances were observed for actual water-to-media switch over when the system feed was changed from water to 55 wt.% cerelose and back again. In all of these instances, an acceptable temperature spike was considered to be less than the variation observed during normal flow operation. Since these spikes were negligible, it was not necessary to flush the system appreciably after a switch to regain steady performance. In addition, sewer to recycle, waste to sewer, and fermenter to waste transitions were not potential sterility risks since these typically occurred after sterilized medium transfer was completed.

]. For longer residence periods of 40 s, the temperature drop was 0.04°C for insulated and 0.35°C for non-insulated cases. These temperature drops are expected to increase with higher residence times and higher holding temperatures. Extrapolating from these data assuming operation at 85°C, a change of 0.0583°C/min was expected, translating to an expected drop of 0.525°C for a residence time of 9 min. Since the actual operating temperature was substantially higher at 150°C, the observed drop of 1°C appears consistent with these earlier studies.

As expected, flowrate variations were somewhat greater for the centrifugal than for the positive displacement Moyno feed pump. The relative sensitivities of retention loop inlet and outlet temperatures to changes in system back-pressure were found to be negligible. This behavior was improved from the prior direct steam injection design since steam/water mixing was more volatile and pressure-sensitive.

 differences were <10% between the two inlet feed pumps using the same medium type, residence time, and sterilization hold temperature; these differences were presumed due to small volumetric flowrate changes, thus slightly altering residence times. Different flowmeters controlled flowrate depending on the inlet pump utilized, but the flowmeter after the recuperator was used for the calculation regardless.

These values were 15- to 100-fold lower (depending on the particle size assumed) than the lowest system velocities. Settling velocities were expected to be even lower as the temperature decreased owing to the higher specific gravity of water.

]. Installation of several temperature and pressure indicators for in process monitoring, along with a functional sterility test, was the preferred approach to demonstrate proper operation.
Operational testing was performed to test both the steam sterilization-to-water transition and water sterilization modes. Regardless of the sterilization method used, prior steam sterilization of the empty system and subsequent switching back pressure control from the “flash” to process cooler was required. Each method had key points requiring extra care- the initial water introduction for the steam sterilization-to-water transition and placing the empty non-sterile side of the recuperator on-line for the water sterilization. Thus, the time and attention required to execute either method was reasonably equivalent.

 range of 150–3,000 min. One sterility test was successfully completed using the water sterilization method. Changes between non-sterilized and sterilized sterility medium were minimal for total dissolved solids (<±3–8%) and conductivity (<3% decrease), confirming minimal medium dilution since all heating was done indirectly. Glucose concentration (measured enzymatically by a YSI analyzer, Yellow Springs, OH, USA) decreased by 15–25%, likely reflecting glucose complexing with nitrogen during sterilization and not medium dilution. Further tests for different media (50 vol.% glycerol, 50 wt.% cerelose, 5 wt.% Pharmamedia) are to be done as process development requirements dictate.

), system cleanability was acceptable. There were significant concerns about cleaning HEXs with full-face gaskets installed due to the potential for accumulated residue where the spirals contacted the door and underneath the gasket at the center nozzles since the gasket hole was braced only by the spiral face. System cleanliness was evaluated by (1) examining inlet and outlet conductivity differences and comparing values to those for DIW, (2) analyzing rinse water samples for total solids, filtered solids, color, and ultraviolet absorbance, and (3) visual inspection and swabbing internal surfaces for total organic carbon (TOC), including the HEXs. There were no appreciable differences between source and rinse water in these measurements. Residue accumulation was negligible on the process sides of all spiral HEXs, and swab-testing results were less than 25 ppm TOC for each location examined.

Conclusion
Improvements implemented for a next generation, pilot-scale continuous sterilization system span the design, fabrication, and testing project phases and have been described. Advantages and disadvantages of various system features were evaluated based on literature analysis from fermentation as well as other related applications. Successful realization of these requirements depended on the adoption of an effective project strategy. The selected system vendor had experience primarily with the food industry since there were few new media sterilizers for manufacturing being constructed and even fewer for pilot plant process development use. Thus, it was critical to devote sufficient time to comprehensively determining system requirements. Development of a detailed sequence of operation as the piping and instrument diagram (P&ID) itself was developed ensured alignment of performance expectations. In addition, selection of a system (as well as HEX) vendor who was located nearby facilitated interim progress examinations prior to delivery.
The “worst case” design scenarios were determined carefully, ensuring that they did not create unnecessary additional costs. Agreement on the design assumptions and performance requirements was critical, particularly for calculated quantities. Specifically, the entire system operation needed to be evaluated when developing the HEX performance requirements. Interim temperatures and pressures were estimated based on the system’s flow connections and not simply considering each HEX separately. Since the temperature rise in each HEX stream depended on actual flowrate, design calculations were done using expected flowrates and not solely the maximum flowrates that the HEX can support. Finally, a check of calculations for the various design cases ensured they were internally consistent.
Performance testing was devised to quantify actual operation versus design expectations. Intermediate pressure and temperature measurements within the system were compared to design calculations to identify performance issues. Communication of acceptable variability to the control and instrument system designer upfront ensured proper test criteria were met and steady state variations were acceptable. Tests were performed and documented for all operational phases. These system tests were considered critical to effectively characterizing the system’s capabilities prior to placing the equipment in service.
