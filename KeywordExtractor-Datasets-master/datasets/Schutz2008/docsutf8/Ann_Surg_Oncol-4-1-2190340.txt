Background
The use of fine needle biopsy (FNB) for the diagnosis of metastatic melanoma can lead to the early removal and treatment of metastases, reduce the frequency of unnecessary surgery, and facilitate the staging of patients enrolled in clinical trials of adjuvant therapies. In this study, the accuracy of FNB for the diagnosis of metastatic melanoma was investigated.

Methods
A retrospective cohort study was performed with 2204 consecutive FNBs performed on 1416 patients known or suspected to have metastatic melanoma. Almost three-quarters (1582) of these FNBs were verified by either histopathologic diagnosis following surgical resection or clinical follow-up.

Results
FNB for metastatic melanoma was found to have an overall sensitivity of 92.1% and a specificity of 99.2%, with 69 false-negative and 5 false-positive findings identified. The sensitivity of the procedure was found to be influenced by six factors. The use of immunostains, reporting of the specimen by a cytopathologist who had reported >500 cases, lesions located in the skin and subcutis, and patients with ulcerated primary melanomas were factors associated with a significant improvement in the sensitivity of the test. However, FNBs performed in masses located in lymph nodes of the axilla and FNBs that required more than one needle pass to obtain a sample were far more likely to result in false-negative results.

Conclusions
FNB is a rapid, accurate, and clinically useful technique for the assessment of disease status in patients with suspected metastatic melanoma.

Fine needle biopsy (FNB) is frequently used in the diagnostic workup of clinically or radiologically detected mass lesions that are suspicious for metastatic melanoma. By determining whether they represent metastatic melanoma, the use of FNB in melanoma patients can expedite detection of metastases, leading to earlier removal and treatment; facilitate the staging of patients enrolled in clinical trials of adjuvant therapies (particularly in deep-seated lesions); reduce the frequency of unnecessary surgery; and assist in the planning of the most appropriate surgery.

 published a study of 739 FNBs from melanoma patients with palpable suspicious lymph nodes or small lesions that were only detectable by ultrasound B-scan examination. Although the authors reported a sensitivity of 97.8% and a specificity of 100.0%, the sensitivity depended on lesion size.
The objective of this retrospective cohort study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the FNB procedure in the detection of metastatic melanoma. To accomplish this, a very large consecutive sample was collected of FNBs performed on melanoma patients who attended the Sydney Melanoma Unit (SMU), Sydney, Australia. This large sample also allowed evaluation of the effect of several clinicopathologic features and factors related to the procedure on the diagnostic accuracy of FNB.

 or by cytocentrifuge preparations, to be used for immunochemistry. The air-dried slides were examined by the cytopathologist at the time of the procedure. Further passes were performed if necessary, depending on the amount and type of cellular material obtained.

Review of Clinical Material and Follow-up
The accuracy of the FNB procedure in diagnosing metastatic melanoma was evaluated by two reference standards: a) histopathologic evaluation of the excised lesion (1120 cases) or b) follow-up in those cases for which histologic material was not available (462 cases). The duration of follow-up was 6 months or greater (mean 50.2 months, median 45.7 months, range 6.1–144.4 months) in 456 cases. In six cases, the length of follow-up was less than 6 months (mean 4.2 months, median 4.0 months, range 3.0–5.7 months). The mass was considered benign if it was stable in size or resolved after clinical follow-up.

Samples that contained cells from unclassified/unspecified malignancies or cases categorized as suspicious for melanoma (those with small numbers of atypical cells, poorly preserved cells, and cells that lacked specific features of melanoma, such as cytoplasmic pigment, and where insufficient material was present for immunochemistry) were classified as suspicious for metastatic melanoma. These were determined to be true suspicious (n = 78, 4.9%) or falsely suspicious (n = 18, 1.1%) results after verification.
FNBs classified as negative for metastatic melanoma contained no material that could be diagnosed as metastatic melanoma. They included cases containing malignant cells diagnosed as another neoplasm or b) various amounts of cellular material from the tissue of the site that was sampled. After verification, these procedures were found to be either true negative (n = 612, 38.7%) or false negative (n = 69, 4.4%).

Statistical Analysis
All analyses were performed using the S-PLUS software package (Insightful Corporation, Seattle, WA) and Microsoft Excel, version 2000 (Microsoft, Redmond, WA). Diagnostic accuracy of FNB for metastatic melanoma was measured by the sensitivity and specificity of the test.

A total of 603 FNBs (27.4%) could not be verified; this was due to loss to follow-up, particularly by death in patients with advanced metastatic melanoma, uncertainty regarding sites (where FNBs from more than one site were obtained at the same visit to the clinic), and where there were multiple metastases, which led to uncertainty in lesion location and the correlation of FNB and histopathologic results. Unconfirmed FNBs differed from confirmed procedures in several ways. They were more likely to be from lesions located in visceral organs or to be in patients with AJCC/UICC stage IV disease. FNBs with inconclusive cytodiagnoses were more likely to be followed up with clinical observation or further biopsy.
Confirmation of FNBs was unaffected by the year of procedure, the number of needle passes during sampling, the use of immunostains, the reporting cytopathologist, or the age or sex of the patient.
Approximately 12% of the patients were diagnosed with additional cancers (most commonly breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia), with some suffering from multiple types of other cancers. Multiple primary melanomas occurred in an eighth of this patient population. Almost a third of the patients underwent multiple FNBs. These procedures were performed both concurrently and sequentially.

DISCUSSION
Metastatic melanoma is an aggressive tumor with a high mortality rate. Patients with primary melanomas that are at high risk of metastasizing who attend the SMU are followed closely for evidence of metastatic disease with radiological investigations and regular clinical follow-up. Early surgery for metastatic disease may lead to longer disease-free periods and may ultimately improve survival in some of these patients. This underscores the importance of early detection of metastatic disease.

 However, the ability of the test to accurately diagnose suspicious lesions as metastatic melanoma has been infrequently studied.

 examined 739 FNBs for metastatic melanoma and found the technique to be highly sensitive (97.9%) at their institution. However, regional node basins in their patient population were routinely evaluated by ultrasound B-scan, and a third of FNB cases were performed under ultrasound guidance.

In this study, there were differences in those FNBs that were verified by the reference tests compared with those that were not. Unconfirmed FNBs were more often performed on nonpalpable lesions in visceral sites, and in patients with advanced disease. Verification rates of negative, positive, and suspicious FNBs were 68.2%, 73.9%, and 82.1%, respectively.

 In all cases, misinterpretation of the cellular material had occurred, three of which were found to be adenocarcinoma. Two of these represented metastatic breast adenocarcinoma in axillary nodes, and one was a metastatic papillary adenocarcinoma of renal origin. Two other false-positive cases were caused by the misinterpretation of large histiocytes or reactive fibroblasts as metastatic melanoma cells.

). Astute clinical and/or radiologic surveillance results in the detection of small suspicious lymph nodes. Difficulties in performing FNBs on such small suspicious lymph nodes contribute to some of the false-negative diagnoses (particulary small, mobile axillary nodes). In fact, approximately a third (n = 21) of these biopsy samples (which were reported as “no malignant cells identified”) did not contain any cellular material, suggesting that an absence of sampling of the malignant cells was the reason for the false-negative result. Further investigation is usually necessary to identify the cause of the mass lesion. Surgical examination is usually the next step when the index of clinical suspicion is high.
There were several sources of difficulty in performing the FNB procedure for metastatic melanoma. Often it occurred when there was a failure to locate the suspicious lesion because of its small size or its location was not communicated with adequate precision. Failure to identify metastatic melanoma occurred when cellular material showed too few typical morphologic characteristics of metastatic melanoma, or these characteristics were destroyed or masked by necrosis.
The large number of confirmed FNB in this study permitted the analysis of subgroups. Most FNB for metastatic melanoma were performed in lymph nodes as well as skin and subcutaneous tissues. No difference in sensitivity was noted among these tissue groups. However, FNBs of lymph nodes of the axilla were significantly less sensitive compared with those performed at other sites and with FNBs performed in lymph nodes of the groin and neck. A number of factors are likely to contribute to the low sensitivity of FNBs performed in the axilla, including the greater difficulty in gaining access to and locating lymph nodes, particularly those high in the axilla, and the presence of large amounts of fatty tissue in axillary lymph nodes (“horseshoe” nodes).

 found that immunochemical characterization was necessary to conclusively diagnose >50% of metastatic melanomas that presented with an equivocal cytological picture. However, immunological characterization cannot be considered definitive when the FNB lacks typical cytologic features expected of metastatic melanoma. For example, one of the false-positive cases exhibited S100 positivity, whereas two of the false-negative FNBs contained melanoma cells that seemed to be S100 negative. This suggests that cytopathologists should be cautious when reporting the results of immunostains on limited samples.
Our study shows that FNB for metastatic melanoma is a procedure with very high specificity and good sensitivity. Several clinicopathologic factors were found to influence the diagnostic accuracy of the test for metastatic melanoma. These included factors relating to the original primary melanoma lesion, location of the sampled lesion, and factors relating to the performance of the test. The SMU employs an on-demand FNB service with assessment of the cytologic material and delivery of a provisional result to the clinician at the time of the patient’s visit. This helps guide subsequent diagnostic and therapeutic measures, and it reduces costs (e.g., by decreasing the need for additional patient visits to the clinic). A multidisciplinary approach involving clinicians, pathologists and radiologists enables an efficient and cost-effective management strategy in melanoma patients.
