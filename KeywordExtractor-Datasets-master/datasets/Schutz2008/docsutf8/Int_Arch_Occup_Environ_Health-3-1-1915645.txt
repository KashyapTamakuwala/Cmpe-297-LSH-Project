) proposes that effort expenditure may have adverse consequences for health in the absence of sufficient recovery opportunities. Thus, insight in the relationships between effort and recovery is imperative to understand work-related health. This study therefore focused on the relation between work-related effort and recovery (1) during workdays, (2) in-between workdays and (3) in the weekend. For these three time periods, we compared a group of employees reporting relatively low levels of work-related effort (“low-effort group”) and a group of employees reporting relatively high levels of work-related effort (“high-effort group”) with respect to (1) activity patterns, (2) the experience of these activity patterns, and (3) health and well-being indicators.

Methods
high-effort group
low-effort group
 = 27) completed a general questionnaire and took part in a 7-day daily diary study covering five weekdays and the following weekend. Differences between the two effort-groups were examined by means of analysis of variance.

Results
Compared to the low-effort group, the high-effort group (1) engaged less often in active leisure activities during the week and worked more overtime in the weekend, (2) considered both work and home activities as more effortful, but not as less pleasurable, and (3) reported higher levels of sleep complaints (weekdays only) and fatigue, more preoccupation with work (weekdays only) and lower motivation to start the next workweek during the weekend.

Conclusions
Work-related effort is associated with various aspects of work time and (potential) recovery time in-between workdays and in the weekend. High levels of work-related effort are associated with activity patterns that are less beneficial in terms of recovery, with higher effort expenditure during and after work time, and with diminished health and well-being.

) assume that job characteristics affect worker well-being through worker behavior: it is what people do that makes them feel tired or enthusiastic. Thus, in order to fully understand effort-recovery patterns during and in-between workdays, we must know how people spend their time on work as well as on home activities. Therefore, the present study provided a detailed assessment of employees’ activity patterns during and in-between working time.

). Until now, the extent to which workers experience their daily work and home activities as effortful and/or pleasant has nonetheless remained largely ignored. Therefore, the present study provided a detailed assessment of how employees experience their activities during and in-between working time in terms of effort and pleasure.

How is work-related effort associated with (a) time spent on work activities, (b) experiences of work activities, and (c) health and well-being during the workday?


As the distinction between the two groups is based on employees’ reports of work-related effort, we expect that the high-effort group will also report to have expended higher effort on (at least some of) the specific work activities compared to the low-effort group (Hypothesis 1a). Support for this hypothesis is important from the perspective of validation of the effort-measure used to differentiate between the two effort-groups.
How is work-related effort associated with (a) time spent on home activities, (b) experiences of home activities, and (c) health and well-being in-between successive workdays?

). The latter category is considered as “passive”, whereas the other three categories of activities demand effort to some extent, and are therefore labeled as “active”. Based on ER theory, it can be argued that our capacity to expend effort is limited, and that the more effort is expended at work, the less remains for home activities. Accordingly, the high-effort group is expected to spend less time on and to engage less often in active home activities, and consequently, will spend more time on and engage more often in passive leisure activities (Hypothesis 2a). Because of the supposed limited amount of energy left in the high-effort group, we further expect that this group will experience engagement in active home activities as more effortful relative to the low-effort group (Hypothesis 2b). As we do not have a priori expectations regarding differences between the groups in the pleasure experienced in home activities, possible differences are examined in an exploratory fashion.

How is work-related effort associated with (a) time spent on home activities, (b) experiences of home activities, and (c) health and well-being during the weekend days?


Research question 2
") can be extended to the weekend. Hence, we expect that those who have spent high effort on the job during week days (the high-effort group), will—during the weekend—spend less time on and engage less often in active and will spend more time on and will engage more often in passive home activities (Hypothesis 3a), experience active home activities as more effortful (Hypothesis 3b), report more fatigue and more sleep complaints during the weekend (Hypothesis 3c), and will be more preoccupied with the upcoming workweek, than the low-effort group (Hypothesis 3d).


Method
Participants and procedure
M
age
= 45.0 years, SD = 7.6; 49.5% was assistant professor, 16.1% associate professor, 12.9% full professor, 21.5% other jobs, e.g. researcher or lecturer). Due to strict privacy regulations, we did not know how many of the employees that were approached for participation in the study actually met our inclusion criteria (i.e. had no job outside the university and lived together with a partner who worked at least 2.5 days a week). Therefore, we do not have insight in how many employees were in fact eligible for participation in the study, meaning that the overall response rate and the representativeness of our sample are unknown.
In the second stage of this study starting about ten days after the completion of the general questionnaire, the daily variables of interest were assessed by means of short questionnaires that were completed three times a day, from Monday to Sunday: (1) a morning questionnaire (to be completed after awaking in the morning, between 7:30 and 8:30 a.m.), (2) an afternoon questionnaire (to be completed around 6 p.m.), and (3) an evening questionnaire (to be completed before bedtime, between 10 and 11 p.m.). Only diaries that were completed within an acceptable time range around the requested time were included in the final database. We thus removed morning questionnaires that were completed more than 2 h after awakening; afternoon questionnaires that were completed before 4:30 p.m., after 8 p.m., or less than 3 h after the morning questionnaires; and evening questionnaires that were filled in less than 2 h after the afternoon questionnaire or after 3 a.m. This procedure resulted in 76.2% valid morning diaries, 73.4% valid afternoon diaries, and 72.5% valid evening diaries.

Variables derived from the general questionnaire (general measures)
Job types included “assistant professor”, “associate professor”, “full professor”, and “other”, such as researcher and teacher. Age was measured in years; Gender was coded as “0” for “male” and “1” for “female”. Parental status was coded as “0” for having no children living in the household and “1” for having at least one child living in the household. The last three variables are potential confounders in the relationships of interest and are therefore included as covariates in further analyses.

). An exemplary item is “I am bothered by fatigue” [1 “(almost) never”, 5 (almost) always”], with higher scores reflecting higher levels of fatigue (α = 0.86).

), we distinguished between positive and negative affect regarding work and positive and negative affect regarding family. Sample items for negative affect are “upset” and “distressed”, and examples for positive affect are “enthusiastic” and “proud” (1 very slightly or not at all, 5 extremely), with higher scores indicating higher negative or positive affect (negative affect: Cronbach’s α = 0.83 for work and 0.84 for home; positive affect: Cronbach’s α = 0.87 for work and 0.90 for home).
Life events Participants could report for ten events (e.g., birth of a child, financial troubles, change of job) whether or not they had experienced this event during the past year. The number of events experienced was summed.

Measures derived from the daily questionnaires (daily measures)
To limit the participants’ burden, the questionnaires contained a combination of validated scales as well as single-item report-marks.
Work-related effort
In the afternoon questionnaire, participants were requested to indicate with a report mark the extent to which they considered the preceding workday as effortful (1 “not at all”, 10 “extremely”).


Activities
Time spent daily on work activities
Participants received a list of 13 major work activities and indicated the time (0 “none”, 1 “<1 h”, 2 “1–2 h”,..., and 7 “>6 h”) they had spent on each activity during regular work time, i.e., until 6 p.m. (afternoon questionnaire), and during nonwork time, i.e., after 6 p.m. (evening questionnaire). We recoded this time range to obtain an estimate of the actual time in hours by assuming that the actual time spent on an activity would lie halfway the two extremes (e.g., the category “<1 h” was recoded as “0.5”). Time spent on research activities by day comprised the time spent on “conducting research”, “data-analysis”, “reading specialist literature”, and “writing papers” (until 6 p.m.). Time spent on teaching activities by day included the time spent on “preparing a lecture”, “giving a lecture”, “reading (Ph.D.) students’ assignments”, and “appointments with (Ph.D) students” (until 6 p.m.). Time spent on administrative activities by day consisted of time spent on “preparing a meeting”, “attending a meeting” and “e-mail/phone”. The category “informal contact with colleagues” was entered in the analyses separately. A 13th activity, “other”, was not incorporated in further analyses, as on average only 0.42 h were devoted daily to these activities. All work activities are potentially relevant to all participants as in the Netherlands lecturers also have some research time, and researchers will usually also teach.
Overtime work was computed by summing the time spent on all 13 work activities after 6 p.m. (this university did not offer evening classes) during weekdays, and by summing the total time spent on work activities before and after 6 p.m. on Saturday and on Sunday.

Time spent daily on home activities
2001
) diary study). Answer possibilities and recoding procedure were identical to those used for work activities. To ease interpretation of the categories, participants received examples of activities in each category. Time spent on domestic activities was calculated by summing the total time (i.e., before and after 6 p.m.) devoted each day to “household activities”, “doing odd jobs in or around the house”, “doing the groceries”, “care giving activities” and “businesslike activities”. Time spent on active leisure activities comprised the total time spent daily on “physical activities”, “creative activities” and “social activities”. The total time spent on passive leisure activities was computed by summing the time devoted to these activities (e.g., reading for pleasure, watching TV, listening to music) before and after 6 p.m. The tenth category, “other”, was omitted from further analysis as the mean time spent on these activities ranged from only 0.15 h on Saturday to 0.21 h during weekdays.


Experiences
Participants indicated for each engaged work and home activity, the extent to which they considered it as effortful and as pleasant (1 “not at all”, 10 “extremely”). An estimate of the average daily effort and pleasure for each category of activities was obtained by computing a weighted mean score. Thus, the summed product of hours spent on each activity within a category and the effort (pleasure) experienced while executing the activity was divided by the total hours spent on the activities in the respective category. By employing such a weighted score, the time spent on an activity is controlled for, assuring that the effort (pleasure) score really reflects effort (pleasure).

Health and well-being
2002
), for example “I felt tired mentally” (1 “not at all”, 10 “extremely”). Participants rated each item twice: (1) with respect to the first hour of the workday (Cronbach’s α = 0.87) and (2) with respect to the last hour of the workday (Cronbach’s α = 0.86).
Fatigue was measured in the morning, afternoon and evening questionnaires. Participants rated their current state of fatigue (“How fatigued do you currently feel?”) with a report mark varying from “1” (“not at all”) to “10” (“extremely”).
2002
), slightly adapted to make it suitable for day-to-day measurement. An exemplary item is: “Last night I woke up several times” (1 “yes”, 0 “no”, α = 0.73 across all seven consecutive days). Note that each day’s values for this scale refer to the previous night.
Sleep time (each morning questionnaire) was computed by calculating the self-reported number of hours in-between the time they went to sleep last night (“what time did you go to sleep last night?”) and the time they woke up this morning (“what time did you wake up this morning?”). Again, each day’s values for this scale refer to the previous night.
Preoccupation with work (each morning questionnaire) was assessed with one self-developed item: “I am already mentally involved with the things I have to do at work today [next week]” (1 “not at all”, 5 “extremely”).
Work motivation (each morning questionnaire) regarding the upcoming workday (during weekdays) or the next workweek (during weekend-days) was assessed with one self-developed item: “I feel like starting the next workday [workweek]” (1 “not at all”, 5 “extremely”).
A table with correlations between the study variables can be obtained from the first author on request.

). To examine whether this assumption could be maintained, the distributions of the criterion variables were inspected for univariate normality, both for the total sample and for the low and high effort subgroups. The skewness of the criterion variables was for 61 out of 64 variables in the study lower than 1.00. As this number is already expected on basis of chance, this finding suggests that the assumption of a multivariate normal distribution of the criterion variables could be maintained for practical purposes.

To study possible differences in experiences, two MANCOVA’s were conducted, both based on mean scores across the five workdays. The first analysis revealed that the two effort-groups differed significantly in the average amount of effort reported with respect to the four work activities. Univariate tests showed that the high-effort group experienced each activity as more effortful (Hypothesis 1a supported). The second analysis revealed that the two effort groups did not differ significantly with respect to the pleasure they derived from their work activities.

In sum, the participants in the two effort-groups do not engage in different types of work activities, nor do they experience their work activities differently in terms of pleasantness. However, the high-effort group reports to spend significantly more effort on each of the work activities, experiences significantly higher work-related levels of fatigue at the end of the work day, as well as a stronger increase in fatigue during the workday.

In order to investigate possible differences in their experiences of home activities, two MANCOVA’s were computed, both based on mean scores across the five weekdays. The first analysis showed an overall significant difference between the two effort-groups in the extent to which they considered home activities as effortful. Univariate tests demonstrated that the high-effort group considered active leisure activities and overtime work as more effortful (Hypothesis 2b supported). The second analysis revealed that the two effort-groups did not differ significantly as to their pleasure regarding their home activities.

Furthermore, ANCOVA revealed that the high-effort group reported significantly more sleep complaints (Hypothesis 2c supported for sleep complaints). The third analysis (ANCOVA) showed that the two effort-groups did not differ significantly with regard to sleep time. Concerning preoccupation with work, ANCOVA revealed that the high-effort group was significantly more preoccupied (Hypothesis 2d supported). A similar analysis conducted for work motivation did not reveal any significant differences between the two effort-groups.
In sum, the high-effort group engaged less often in active leisure activities in-between successive workdays, but did not differ significantly from the low effort-group regarding the experience of pleasure associated with these activities. Further, the high-effort group experienced the home activities as more effortful. In addition, we systematically observed higher levels of fatigue; more sleep complaints, and a higher preoccupation with work in the high-effort group in-between workdays.

Two ANCOVAs indicated that sleep complaints and sleep time did not vary significantly between the effort-groups (Hypothesis 3c rejected for sleep complaints).
Two additional ANCOVAs indicated that the two effort-groups did not significantly differ with respect to preoccupation with work during the weekend (Hypothesis 3d rejected), but that the high-effort group felt less like starting the next working week (work motivation).
In sum, the two effort-groups did not show significantly different activity patterns during the weekend regarding domestic work, active and passive leisure. However, the high-effort group spent significantly more hours on overtime work during the weekend than the low-effort group. Furthermore, the high-effort group experienced all home activities as significantly more effortful, although not as less pleasant, than the low effort-group. We also observed significantly higher levels of fatigue during the weekend and less motivation to start the upcoming workweek in the high-effort group.


Discussion
The present study was devised to enhance our insight in the associations between work-related effort and recovery from that effort. To this purpose, we compared two groups of employees reporting different levels of work-related effort (high vs. low) with respect to their activities, experiences, and health and well-being in three time-periods: (1) during work time, (2) in-between work days and (3) during the weekend.
Activity patterns

2001
).
The amount of time devoted to domestic activities during the weekdays and weekend days did not vary significantly between the two effort-groups. This may be due to the fact that many domestic activities are obligatory in nature (e.g., it is difficult to circumvent doing the household chores). Finally, no significant differences between the groups emerged concerning low-effort activities, both during weekdays and weekend days.

Experiences
Regarding experiences, we distinguished between effort and pleasure. The high-effort group reported significantly more effort for all work activities. In the home domain, the high-effort group judged overtime and active leisure activities as more effortful during weekdays and judged all activities as more effortful during the weekend. No significant differences between the groups were observed with respect to pleasure, neither during work time nor in-between workdays, nor in the weekend. Hence, work-related effort is independent of the pleasure derived from work and home activities.

Health and well-being
We observed a stronger increase in work-related fatigue during the workday for the high-effort group than for the low-effort group. Thus, whereas the two groups did not differ significantly in work-related fatigue at the start of the working day, the high-effort group was more fatigued at the end of the working day. This difference persisted in-between workdays. This finding might explain why the high-effort group engaged less often in active leisure in-between workdays than the low-effort group. Also during the weekend, the high-effort group remained significantly more fatigued than the low-effort group. Possibly, this may be due to the fact that the former group spent more time on overtime.
A somewhat different pattern of results was observed with respect to sleep complaints: The high-effort group reported more sleep complaints during the week, but not in the weekend. The additional finding that the two groups did not differ significantly with respect to sleep time suggests that work-related effort relates to sleep quality, but not sleep quantity.
During the week, the high-effort group was apparently more preoccupied with work than the low-effort group. However, it cannot be excluded that this is partly due to our item wording. Although we asked participants to indicate the extent to which they were already preoccupied with the upcoming workday, it would seem possible that this measure (also) reflects the extent to which participants were still ruminating about their past working day. In the weekend, the two groups did not differ significantly in their preoccupation with the upcoming workweek. This is surprising, as the high-effort group spent more time on work-related activities during these days. The high-effort group nonetheless reported less work motivation than the low-effort group.

Limitations and suggestions for future research
P
 < 0.001) between our single-item effort-measure and a weighted mean score of the effort experienced during the separate work activities. The latter was computed by first weighting the number of hours spent on each activity by the effort expended to this activity; the sum of these weighted scores was divided by the total number of work hours. Thus, our single-item report mark seems to measure a very similar quantity as a much more refined measure of effort.
A second point of concern is the procedure used to create the two effort-subgroups. These groups were created based on the number of days participants considered their work as effortful. To probe the possibility that our findings are biased by this somewhat arbitrary procedure we repeated our analyses using a slightly different effort indicator. For each participant who completed the report mark of global work-related effort on at least three occasions, the mean score on this report mark across the week was computed. Based on these scores, two new subgroups were created: One including participants with scores in the highest tertile, and a second with participants having scores in the lowest tertile. Analyses were repeated for these two groups, yielding results that were highly similar to those found for the original subgroups (results can be obtained from the first author on request). Thus, our findings appear robust across different measures of effort expenditure.

) concludes that “the popular position suggesting common method variance automatically affects variables measured with the same method is a distortion and oversimplification of the true state of affairs” (p 221). Thus, all in all we do not believe that common method bias severely biased our findings, although the use of physiological and performance measures in addition to self-reports could provide interesting insights in future research.
A fourth issue is the impact of potential third variables. One might argue that differences between the two effort-groups regarding (experiences of) activities and health and well-being indicators might be due to personality characteristics or other person or work-related constructs, rather than to work-related effort. However, in our study we attempted to exclude the influence of these variables to our best ability: The two effort-groups turned out not to differ regarding the number of life events experienced, general work characteristics (work pressure, job control, social support), fatigue, work engagement, age and positive and negative affect. Of course this does not exclude the possibility that other third variables (e.g., other aspects of personality) may have acted as third variables in this study.
Fifth, this study did not offer insight in the intriguing question into the origin of the differences in work-related effort between the two subgroups studied. It may be that these differences are at least partly due to differences in participants’ objective work performance (e.g., number of publications or student evaluations), but such measure was not incorporated in this study. Thus, it is unclear how the differences between the two effort-groups in their work-related effort are related to real output differences, and future studies on this topic should also include objective measures of task performance.
Finally, the present research employed a very specific sample, consisting of academic staff members who worked at least 32 h a week and who lived together with a partner who worked at least 2.5 days a week, and who, as is common for tenured academics in the Netherlands, have relatively high job security and are not dependent on fund raising. Although we believe that our main findings on the relations among effort, recovery, health and well-being are not unique to this sample, it is desirable to replicate this study for employees in other professions, in other family situations and/or with other working hours. Thus, future studies should employ samples from other contexts to broaden our understanding of effort and recovery patterns.

Assets of this study
In spite of these limitations, we believe that the present study extends and enhances previous research on effort and recovery in at least four respects. First, this study is among the very few that examine effort and recovery from a day-to-day perspective, allowing us to demonstrate that work-related effort is related to various aspects of daily work and (potential) recovery time. In this vein, this study shows how effort expenditure at work is actually imbedded in everyday life, and how it relates to recovery during time-off-the job.
Secondly, this study emphasized the importance of the weekend as a (potential) opportunity for recovery. Whereas some differences between the two effort-groups persisted throughout the weekend (e.g., higher levels of fatigue and effort-investment for the high-effort group), other differences manifested themselves only during the working week (i.e., less active leisure, more sleep complaints and more preoccupation with work for the high-effort group) or only during the weekend (i.e., more overtime work and less work motivation for the high-effort group). Thus, not all workers employ the recovery opportunities offered by the weekend in a similar fashion: some seem to employ the weekend as a means to catch up with their overdue tasks. These results suggest that it would be worthwhile to study the reasons why workers differ in the way they use their weekend.
Thirdly, by paying attention to employees’ activity patterns at work and outside work, we were able to show that effort expenditure at work relates to activity patterns in the home domain. Namely, high levels of effort expenditure at work were associated with less engagement in active leisure and more overtime work. This finding thus suggests that for some workers, high effort expenditure at work is not compensated by a corresponding degree of participation in recovery activities. Given that an imbalance between effort and recovery is associated with adverse health outcomes, this particular group of workers may, in the long run, be a risk group for the development of ill health.
Fourthly, we demonstrated that experiences associated with engagement in work and home activities are important: higher effort investment at work is related to experiences of higher effort expenditure outside work, but not to experiences of less pleasure regarding work or home activities.

Practical implications
Based on our study’s results, three practical suggestions can be formulated. Firstly, adequate control opportunities in the job setting will allow workers to adjust their work behavior to their current need for recovery and, thus, to prevent the development of negative load reactions during working. Secondly, employees should be encouraged to engage in leisure activities that potentially contribute to the recovery process, such as active leisure. Finally, the time spent on overtime work should be kept within acceptable limits, as overtime work impedes the recovery process. Employers should not to demand excessive overtime work from their employees, in order to guarantee sufficient (potential) recovery time (see also Beckers et al. in press).

Theoretical implications
2001
). That recovery is endangered in the high-effort group is also evidenced by the higher levels of fatigue during non-work time (evenings and weekends) and the lower sleep quality during the week. Apart from a different activity pattern, those expending high effort at work also expend high effort on home activities, which also may endanger the recovery process. Therefore, despite the fact that those investing high effort at work do not experience their activities as less pleasant than those expending low effort, they may be considered at risk for developing health problems in the long run.
