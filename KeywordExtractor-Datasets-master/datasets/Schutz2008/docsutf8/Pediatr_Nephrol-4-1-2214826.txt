Rituximab (RTX), an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, has been proposed for use in the therapy of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). We present the initial long-term experience of the safety and efficacy of rituximab for treatment of SLE in children. Eighteen patients (mean age 14 ± 3 years) with severe SLE were treated with rituximab after demonstrating resistance or toxicity to conventional regimens. There was a predominance of female (16/18) and ethnic African (13/18) patients. All had lupus nephritis [World Health Organization (WHO) classes 3–5] and systemic manifestations of vasculitis. Clinical disease activity of the SLE was scored with the SLE-disease activity index 2K (SLEDAI-2K). Patients were followed-up for an average of 3.0 ± 1.3 years (range 0.5 to 4.8 years). B-cell depletion occurred within 2 weeks in all patients and persisted for up to 1 year in some. Clinical activity scores, double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) antibodies, renal function and proteinuria [urine protein to creatinine ratio (Upr/cr)] improved in 93% of the patients. Five patients required multiple courses of RTX for relapse, with B-cell repopulation. One died of infectious endocarditis related to severe immunosuppression. In conclusion, our data support the efficacy of rituximab as adjunctive treatment for SLE in children. Although rituximab was well tolerated by the majority of patients, randomized controlled trials are required to establish its long-term safety and efficacy.

The purpose of our study was to determine the safety and efficacy of RTX therapy in the treatment of children with severe SLE. Over the course of 7 years, we retrospectively assessed the indications and responses to RTX therapy in a cohort of children with active SLE that was refractory to conventional therapies or who had clinical indications prohibiting the use of more toxic immunosuppressant drugs.

Patients and methods
A retrospective analysis was performed on a cohort of 51 patients diagnosed with SLE and lupus nephritis who received their care at Holtz Children’s Hospital, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, between January 1996 and June 2007. The study was approved by the institutional review board, with waiver of consent authorization, and all subjects were assured anonymity in compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). The medical records were reviewed for patients’ demographic characteristics, age at diagnosis, prior and current medical treatments, type of lupus nephritis and serologic and clinical response to therapy.

 per dose, infused over 6 h to 8 h. Premedication initially consisted of diphenhydramine and acetaminophen, administered 30 min before the rituximab infusion. However, mild infusion reactions, including pruritis, nausea and emesis, resulted in our adding hydrocortisone 50–100 mg intravenously 30 min prior to each infusion. Lymphocyte subsets were assayed before and after each course of RTX therapy at 1- to 3-month intervals. This included B cells assayed as CD19+ lymphocytes and T-cells assayed as CD4 and CD8 lymphocytes as total and percent of the total lymphocyte cell count. The serum immunoglobulin levels were measured every 1 to 6 months prior to and after the course of RTX. Adverse events were recorded from the time of the first infusion until 1 year following the treatment course.

P
 values of less than 0.05 were considered significant. All results are expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD).


Results
Patients’ demographics
During the period of observation 18 patients were treated with RTX for at least one course of two to four doses. There were 16 female patients and two male patients. Mean age at the time of diagnosis of SLE was 10.7 ± 2.5 years (range 7 to 14 years). Mean duration of disease prior to treatment with RTX was 3.1 ± 2.5 years (range 2 months to 8 years). Age at the time of first RTX treatment was 14.2 ± 3.3 years, and current age at the time of this report was 17 ± 5.0 years.

All three patients on hemodialysis responded positively to the RTX therapy. Patient HD-1 had Raynaud’s syndrome and finger necrosis; her symptoms resolved, and she recently received a transplant, 4 years after RTX treatment. Patient HD-2, who had been on ventilator support with pneumonitis, pleuritis and carditis for 1 month prior to receiving RTX, recovered and has been stable on hemodialysis as an outpatient for >4 years since RTX therapy. Patient HD-3, after 3 years on hemodialysis, developed debilitating chorea with increased lupus serology. She did not respond to anti-convulsant therapy. The chorea resolved within weeks of the RTX therapy. She remains on dialysis without recurrence of chorea.

, possibly related to prior CYC therapy. At the time of her death her serum immunoglobulin levels were normal.
Patient #13 had systemic vasculitis and class IV lupus nephritis. Since she was only 7 years of age, it was decided to treat her with intravenous administration of Solu-Medrol followed by weekly RTX for four doses and concurrent mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) as induction therapy. She responded well to RTX, with resolution of her proteinuria and clinical remission of the lupus nephritis. However, she developed symptoms of cerebral vasculitis, with seizures and a cerebral infarct, demonstrated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) after her fourth dose of RTX. She was treated with intravenously administered gamma globulin (IVIG) and two doses of cyclophosphamide. Her neurologic deficits resolved and her vasculitis reversed, as demonstrated by MRI. She remains in remission of the lupus nephritis and cerebritis 6 months after RTX therapy.
Mild adverse reactions occurred in approximately half the patients and included pruritis, nausea, or malaise associated with the infusions. These became less when hydrocortisone was added to the pre-medication regimen and the infusion rate was slowed to 6 to 8 hours.

In conclusion, RTX therapy offers a potential innovation in the current treatment regimens for children with aggressive SLE that includes both renal and extra-renal manifestations. The development of a randomized controlled treatment protocol for induction and maintenance therapy in pediatric patients is very much warranted.
