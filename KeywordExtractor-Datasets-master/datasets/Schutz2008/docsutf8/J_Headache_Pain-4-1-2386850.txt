A recent health economic survey in Europe has suggested that migraine is the costliest among the neurological disorders. According to many studies, migraine and other disorders lead to widespread suffering, reduction of quality of life, and marked impairment of participation, both in work and social activities. The present literature survey was made in order to summarize what is known on the subject, as a preparation for a EU-supported study to assess the impact in several EU countries with similar methodology and the same research instrument. Previous studies have yielded relatively reliable data only for migraine, whereas the impact of tension-type headache is virtually unknown or only very incompletely known for most dimensions of headache impact. Some data do suggest, however, that this headache may be as important from a health economic and a public health perspective as migraine. In future studies it is important to get population-based data from various countries relevant for estimation of indirect (mostly absenteeism from work and reduced working efficiency when having headache) and direct costs (related to medication, consultations, investigations and hospitalisations). Also, the impact on ability to get education and participate in the workforce is very relevant, as is the impact on love life and family planning. The quality of life of headache patients should be measured by validated instruments. To get a complete picture, one should also ask about the effect on the life of partners and children, and on the possible impact even when headache-free (e.g. fear of the next attack).

) is an initiative supported by the EC Public Health Excecutive Agency launched in May 2007. Its objectives are to bring together the relevant medical, scientific and lay organizations, and to gather updated reliable comparable information regarding migraine, tension-type and chronic headache. It will be the first data collection on headaches at EU level focusing on a holistic, patient-driven and scientifically validated approach, aiming to fill in the main holes in our knowledge by performing comparable studies on headache prevalence and its impact in selected European countries (Austria, France, Germany, Italy, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Spain, UK, Ireland, Luxembourg). A pilot study has already been performed in Luxembourg. The present review of the existing literature on both economic and non-economic impact was performed as a part of the Eurolight project, to assess the current state of knowledge, and to build up a questionnaire to measure all the most relevant aspects of headache impact. This study presents the results of this review and a suggestion of the main dimensions that ought to be covered in the headache impact tool to be used in the Eurolight study.

Economic impact of headache
Headache may have considerable economic consequences, both for the patient and for the society as a whole. There are more studies about the societal costs than about the individual economic losses of the patients.

These data are, however, of relatively limited interest from an economical viewpoint as they do not indicate the number of days that the headache sufferers are away from work.

Effectiveness when working with headache

]. In this study, it was found that the working ability assessed by self-report was much lower than the objectively measured working efficiency (20 vs. 8%). The relatively small decline in working ability led the authors to conclude that workers with even relatively severe headache find creative ways to cope with the pain and maintain standards.

]. No studies analysing the cost of TTH or other non-migraineous headaches were found. There were large variations in costs across the six European countries where data were available, ranging from around €100 per patient per year in Sweden to nearly €900 in Germany. These variations are probably mostly due to different methodologies and differences in the year when the studies were conducted. An important finding was that the vast majority of total costs, between 72 and 98%, was indirect costs, due to lost productivity, either in the form of work absence or reduced efficiency levels when working with migraine. Women tended to lose more workdays than men, but indirect costs were similar due to lower salaries and labour force participation amongst women. The direct costs, related to consultation, diagnostic investigations, treatments, and hospital admissions accounted for less than 30% of total costs in most studies.

], i.e. 41 million adult Europeans with active migraine. Per patient migraine was the least costly disorder among the brain disorders. However, due to the high prevalence, the total cost of migraine was estimated to be €27 billion for whole Europe in 2004, which was the highest cost among the purely neurological disorders. Many of the psychiatric afflictions were even more costly according to this review. It is, however, likely that the available cost data in Europe would tend to underestimate the actual costs of headache, mainly because no cost data existed on the most common headache type (TTH), but also because children and adolescents were not considered, and because cost connected with more expensive medication (triptans) were not included, since most cost studies were performed before this class of drugs was introduced.

] population-based studies which demonstrated that around 1,100–1,300 days per 1,000 workers were missed due to headache each year. The British study also suggested that the number of days with reduced efficacy was around four times higher than the number of days missed. Assuming a reduced efficiency of 35% when working with headache, and that the direct costs of headache constitute the same proportion of the total costs as for migraine, the average total cost per headache patient was estimated to be roughly €420 per year (of which €390 would be due to indirect costs and €30 due to direct medical costs). Since headache in general was found to affect nearly 50 % of Europeans, this estimate, if true, would make headache a much more costly disorder than migraine alone.

34
], restricted to the direct costs in 1999, found that these costs were at least twice as high (€128) as in the European migraine cost study (<€60). This study included both “strict” migraine (IHS 1.1 and 1.2) and “migraineous disorder” (IHS 1.7, corresponding to 1.6 in ICHD-2), which together affected 17% of the population. For the whole country the direct costs amounted to more than 1 billion €, which was 0.068% of the gross national product. Non-migraineous episodic headache, affecting 9.2% of the population, entailed a considerably lower cost of €28.
35
34
33
] may therefore at least partly be due to the differences in cost assessment methodology, indicating that the direct costs specifically related to migraine and not to comorbid disorders are most reliably assessed by a direct method, questioning patients about use of health-care resources.

]. If one uses the European data from this study it can be calculated that the hours with migraine headache would add up to between 34 and 100 h per year, if distributed on each adult individual in the population. The data on TTH are too scarce to use for similar calculations.

Family impact of migraine

], the percentage of migraine sufferers who reported a negative impact of migraine was 76% for attendance to work, 67% for family situation, 59% for leisure time, 48% for pursuing studies, 46% for sexual life, 37 % for their social position, 31% for love, 30% for their financial situation, 27% for making a career, and 11% for making friends.
60
]. The impact was very similar in both countries. More than 60% of patients reported a marked impact on the ability to do household chores because of their migraine during the past 3 months, and it was markedly reduced also in 20% of the patients’ partners. Almost 46% of patients, and 24% of partners had missed days of family or social activities due to the proband’s migraine, and 16% of patients and 12% of partners had avoided making plans for family or social activities due to the proband’s migraine. As to the impact on the children of patients, more than 60% stated that it had a moderate to marked influence on the relation with their children, 40% stated that they would have been a better guardian or parent without migraine, more than 10% stated that their children had missed school, and 10% that their children had been late to school because of their headache. Forty-six percent of patients stated that they would have been better partners without headaches, and 5% stated that they had had fewer children because of headache, 0.4% that they had avoided having children, and 15% that they had avoided oral contraception. Compared with a control group, the partners of migraine patients were significantly more dissatisfied with the demands, responsibility and duties placed upon them, and with their ability to perform.

Conclusions
Health economic studies have documented that the costs of headache disorders are huge; the costs only for migraine amounting to €27 billion in the EU countries, and the cost for other headaches are probably as large. However, better population-based cost studies are needed to assess the cost involved with TTH. Headache sufferers tend to have lower income and education, and more of them may be unemployed, but it is still uncertain whether this is true for most European countries, and also whether it may be a cause of or an effect of headache. It is also amply documented that migraine confers a high degree of disability with more forced absence from work and leisure activities, and migraineurs also have a measurably reduced quality of life. In addition, there is a marked impact on family life, and headaches also put considerable strains on partners and children. A minority of headache sufferers chose to have fewer children than they would have had if they had not had headaches.
