Osteochondral transplantation is a successful treatment for full-thickness cartilage defects, which without treatment would lead to early osteoarthritis. Restoration of surface congruency and stability of the reconstruction may be jeopardized by early mobilization. To investigate the biomechanical effectiveness of osteochondral transplantation, we performed a standardized osteochondral transplantation in eight intact human cadaver knees, using three cylindrical plugs on a full-thickness cartilage defect, bottomed on one condyle, unbottomed on the contralateral condyle. Surface pressure measurements with Tekscan pressure transducers were performed after five conditions. In the presence of a defect the border contact pressure of the articular cartilage defect significantly increased to 192% as compared to the initially intact joint surface. This was partially restored with osteochondral transplantation (mosaicplasty), as the rim stress subsequently decreased to 135% of the preoperative value. Following weight bearing motion two out of eight unbottomed mosaicplasties showed subsidence of the plugs according to Tekscan measurements. This study demonstrates that a three-plug mosaicplasty is effective in restoring the increased border contact pressure of a cartilage defect, which may postpone the development of early osteoarthritis. Unbottomed mosaicplasties may be more susceptible for subsidence below flush level after (unintended) weight bearing motion.

] reported in agreement with this that the push-in force below flush level for (unbottomed) multiple grafts was significantly lower compared to a single graft. Theoretically, width differences of the cartilage layer between trochlea (donor area) and condyl (defect area) might have an influence on restoration of surface congruency.

The objective of the present study was to investigate the biomechanical effectiveness of osteochondral transplantation. More specifically we assessed whether the treatment would decrease peak stresses at the boundaries of the original articular cartilage defect. Subsequently, we analysed if articular stresses were dependent on plug placement (bottomed versus unbottomed) and how this was affected by loads that represented (for instance unintended) early weight bearing.

). In order to confirm validity of this method a test was performed where the sensor was repeatedly fixated and completely removed from the knee and the plastic marker was visualized. Reproducibility of the re-attachement of the sensor was confirmed by five independent measurements of the position of a circular cap, each after removing a re-attachment of the Tekscan sensor. Four out of five measurements showed exactly the same position of the cap within the Tekscan matrix, which proves a high accuracy of re-attachment.
To investigate the consequences of a cartilage defect and subsequent mosaicplasty on the stress distribution under various conditions, Tekscan recordings were performed under five different conditions: (A) preoperatively, intact condition, (B) cartilage defect without any reconstruction, (C) following mosaicplasty, (D) after mosaicplasty and subsequent non-weight bearing motion of the knee and (E) after mosaicplasty with weight bearing motion (E). All surface measurements were performed with the knee in 0° extension, thereby ensuring loading of the (restored) defective sites, and an axial load of 350 N.
The ‘preoperative’ measurement (A) was with intact condyles. After removing the sensors, both on the medial and lateral condyle a standardized subchondral defect, 8 mm deep was created by a circular drill of 16 mm diameter, the center being at exactly the same location as the center of the plastic marker that was measured previously.

). At the opposite condyle, which was to be unbottomed, three defects of approximately 20 mm depth were created, and the donor plugs of 15 mm were used. The difference of 5 mm in length between the defects was essential for the unbottomed plugs to be sure to have a cavity at the bottom of the defect and therefore rely exclusively on frictional forces.
The ‘mosaicplasty’ surface measurement (C) was executed after performing both mosaicplasties. The ‘non-weight bearing motion’ measurement (D) was performed following flexing and extending the knee 20 times, while no weight was attached to the test device. The axial load of 350 N was re-applied before the measurement was performed. The final ‘weight bearing motion’ measurement (E), was performed once the knee had been flexed and extended 20 times with 350 N of axial force applied to the knee while performing the flexion-extension movements.

Evaluation of variables
Each of the eight knees provided two paired standardized mosaicplasties of three plugs, one bottomed and one unbottomed. Thus, there were 16 mosaicplasties: eight bottomed and eight unbottomed. Three general groups were created for statistical evaluation: the whole group of all mosaicplasties (bottomed and un-bottomed combined), a group with only bottomed and one with only unbottomed mosaicplasties. The five measurements performed were: (A) preoperative, (B) defect, (C) mosaicplasty, (D) non-weight bearing motion, (E) and weight bearing motion.

 The mosaicplasty area (region 1) is a circle consisted of square pixels with a diameter of 12 pixels. The border area (region 2) is a ring with a diameter of 3 pixels around the defect circle. A transition zone of 1 pixel around the mosaicplasty area is found between regions 1 and 2





Statistics
Contact pressures were calculated at the boundaries of the cartilage defect (region 2) as well as for the defect/mosaicplasty (region 1) itself. This was done for five different conditions as described before (A–E). These values were expressed for three groups, namely bottomed, unbottomed and combined.

Two out of eight unbottomed versus zero bottomed mosaicplasties showed a decreased mosaicplasty pressure and increased rim stress after weight bearing motion on individual Tekscan measurements, indicating that the mosaicplasty subsided below flush level. Five out of eight bottomed plugs were placed on the medial condyle and no significant differences in pressure or rim stress was found.

Discussion
In this biomechanical human cadaver study we clearly demonstrated that an osteochondral cartilage defect severely affects the contact pressure on the remaining intact joint surface. Obviously, there are some additional limitations to our study. The study had only a limited number of knees. During testing osteoarthritic changes in bone were found in some of these elderly knees. Clearly this is different to the bone quality of the typical patient who is relatively young and active. Another limitation was that during the preparations the knee was positioned in such a way that both condyles would be loaded with approximately the same force, which may be different from in vivo loads. This might have had an influence on the absence of medial/lateral differences. Contrary to other experiments we kept all collateral ligaments and intra-articular structures intact, which resembles the anatomical situation more closely and thus gives a greater translational value of pressure transfer. Clearly, no biological effects were taken into account such as the resorption of the plugs (thereby reducing the stability) or bony ingrowth (thereby enhancing stability). We also measured the contact patterns under static conditions with the knee in extension, whereas in reality shear forces at different flexion angles are also applied to the reconstruction. These limitations should be taken into account when interpreting the results.

] found in a follow-up study of 33 years that 80% of the adults with osteochondritis dissecans developed secondary gonarthrosis. The gonarthrosis seemed to have its onset 10 years earlier (mean age 49 instead of 59 years) in life than primary gonarthrosis. Clearly, the increased potential of degenerative changes in the knee following an articular cartilage defect is of great clinical importance. Especially because this type of cartilage defect frequently occurs in the younger aged population.

] reported peak contact pressure reduced to normal when plugs were flush. However, they used only one plug, which does not correspond to clinical practice. It may be more difficult to obtain a smooth cartilage surface when using more plugs, which explains why we did not find a complete normalization of the contact stresses.

Clinical relevance
A cartilage defect results in increased stress levels at the articular cartilage boundaries of the defect. A multiple plug mosaicplasty has a positive effect in reducing these stress elevations, which will reduce the potential of cartilage degeneration, and thus may postpone secondary osteoarthritis. Post-operative non-weight bearing and weight bearing motions did not seem to influence the surface congruency of the mosaicplasty, although the unbottomed mosaicplasties showed a trend of subsidence below flush level after weight bearing motion. It appears feasible to allow limited weight bearing of the knee after osteochondral transplantation, especially when plugs have been bottomed.
