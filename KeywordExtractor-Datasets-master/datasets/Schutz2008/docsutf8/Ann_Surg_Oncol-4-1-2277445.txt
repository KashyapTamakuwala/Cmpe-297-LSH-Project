Background
We previously identified tumor-reactive lymphocytes in the first lymph nodes that drain the primary tumor. In this study, we performed lymphatic mapping to investigate the possibility of finding the first lymph nodes that drain metastases, and of learning whether these lymph nodes contained tumor-reactive lymphocytes suitable for adoptive immunotherapy.

Methods
Nineteen patients were studied. The primary tumor site was colorectal cancer in seven patients, malignant melanoma in four, ovarian cancer and breast cancer in two, and one each with pancreatic cancer, cholangiocarcinoma, leiomyosarcoma, and squamous cellular cancer of the tongue. By injection of Patent blue dye or radioactive tracers around the metastases, we identified draining lymph nodes from liver metastases (n = 9), intra-abdominal local recurrences (n = 3), and regional lymph node metastases (n = 7). In six patients, a preoperative lymphoscintigraphy was performed.

Results
We located the first draining lymph node or nodes from metastases or local recurrences; we named them “metinel nodes.” Lymphocytes from the metinel nodes proliferated, showed clonal expansion, and produced interferon gamma (via in vitro expansions on stimulation with tumor homogenate) and interleukins, all of which demonstrate the characteristics of tumor-reactive lymphocytes. Eight of the nineteen patients received immunotherapy on the basis of tumor-reactive T cells derived from the metinel nodes.

Conclusions
We demonstrate that it is possible to locate the first lymph nodes draining subcutaneous, lymphatic, and visceral metastases, the so-called metinel nodes. Metinel node–derived lymphocytes may be used to treat disseminated solid cancer, and clinical trials should evaluate the effect of such treatment.

 regarding primary tumor lymphatic drainage. We believe that a similar technique may be of use in surgery for liver metastases and other solid metastatic tumors for correct staging, and thereby for giving the patients the most appropriate therapy.

 Through the injection of Patent blue dye or radioactive tracer subserosally during surgery around the colonic tumor or transurethrally around the urinary bladder tumor, the sentinel nodes were found. A biopsy was performed, and the nodes’ immunological role and function were studied. After preparation, the lymphocytes were identified, isolated, and proliferated in vitro by stimulation of interleukins (ILs) and tumor antigen. Lymphocytes from sentinel nodes proliferated dose dependently and secreted interferon (IFN)-γ on stimulation with tumor homogenate.
The aim of the present study was to investigate lymphatic drainage from metastases and identify first draining lymph nodes. We also analyzed tumor-reactive immunological properties in lymphocytes derived from these lymph nodes.

The lymph nodes that drained metastases were identified by injecting approximately 1 mL Patent blue dye (PB) (Guerbet, Paris) subserosally or subcutaneously in four places around one of the metastasis or in the tissues close to the local recurrences with a 27-gauge needle. After the injection of PB, the first draining lymph nodes turned blue within 3 to 10 minutes and were regarded as metastases-draining lymph nodes. In our previous work, a 10-minute cutoff was sufficient to identify sentinel nodes to primary tumors. We have experienced that during this period of time the first draining lymph nodes turn blue. Waiting longer means that a second echelon of draining lymph nodes may be colored blue, which does not represent the first draining lymph nodes. We arbitrarily applied the same 10-minute limit when detecting lymph nodes that drain metastases. These lymph nodes were either immediately removed or marked with sutures.
The sources of the liver metastases in our study were from colorectal cancer in five patients and in one patient each from ovarian cancer, breast cancer, cholangiocarcinoma, and leiomyosarcoma. Four patients had subcutaneous lymph node metastases from disseminated malignant melanoma, and one patient each had metastases from ovarian cancer, breast cancer, and squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue. Two patients had intra-abdominal local recurrences after surgery for colon cancer, and one patient had an intra-abdominal local recurrence after surgery for pancreatic cancer.
Because of these liver metastases, five patients underwent partial right-sided liver resections (patients 4, 5, 6, 15, and 17), and three patients underwent partial left-sided liver resection (patients 2, 18, and 19). The patient with metastases resulting from ovarian cancer (patient 7) had several large, bulky, cystic tumors, and surgeons performed an almost complete right-sided liver resection. In four cases, surgery was performed for solitary colorectal liver metastases (patients 2, 4, 5 and 6), and in the remaining five cases, tumor-reducing surgery was performed.
In six cases, a preoperative lymphoscintigraphy was performed by a subcutaneous injection of 4 × 10 to 15 MBq Tc-nanokolloid radioactive tracer in quadrants around the metastasis. The lymphoscintigraphies were performed to plan the surgical procedure by localizing the lymph node or nodes draining the metastasis. The position of the metastasis-draining lymph node or nodes was marked on the skin with a felt-tip pen. When the lymphoscintigraphy was not performed on the day of surgery, a new peritumoral injection of radioactive tracer was made at start of surgery. The draining nodes were intraoperatively identified by the use of a handheld gamma detection tube. In four of six cases, a simultaneous intraoperative injection of PB was performed.

Preparation of Specimens
Lymph nodes draining metastases and nondraining lymph nodes (for analytical purposes) were surgically removed and immediately taken to the laboratory on ice. In addition, one 5-mm slice of the whole metastasis (including the invasive margin) was also dissected and sent for analysis. Frequently, most of the lymph node or nodes were used for the expansion procedure. The remaining specimens underwent routine histopathological examinations with hematoxylin and eosin staining. At the laboratory, slices <1 mm were cut from the central and peripheral part of the lymph nodes for analysis by flow cytometry (FACS) and proliferation analyses. The metastasis was also analyzed by FACS, and a preparation of the whole tumor (homogenate) was used.

 and used as antigen-presenting cells for restimulation together with further addition of tumor homogenate. To verify clonal expansion of T lymphocytes, Vβ repertoire analyses were performed in a few cases. To test for functionality, single cell suspensions were investigated for Th1 and Th2 cytokine production, IFN-γ, and IL-4.

 cells/mL.
The transfusions took place at the surgical ward as an intravenous transfusion over the course of 1 hour. Our criterion for adoptive transfer is a transfusion of lymphocytes to a patient, regardless of the number of transferred cells. In our previous studies (M.K., unpublished data) of adoptive transfer originating from sentinel nodes, on average, 71 million clonally expanded autologous tumor-reactive lymphocytes were transfused to each patient, and in that pilot study, the disease of all 16 patients responded to therapy. We do not know the optimal number of cells to be transfused for the best or maximum immune response, but according to our experience, 39.5 million transfused cells (the average number of transfused cells in the metinel node study) may be sufficient. The explanation may be that the CD4 cells proliferate and promote division of effector T cells and memory T cells when they are stimulated by their antigen (which is derived from the tumor). The cell expansion continues in the patient.

). We denoted these metastasis-draining lymph nodes metinel nodes. Seventeen (40%) of the analyzed metinel nodes were positive for metastatic disease. In 4 (25%) of 16 patients where data were available, all metinel nodes were positive for metastatic disease (range, 2–5), and in 8 (50%) of 16 patients, all metinel nodes (range, 2–3) were negative for metastatic disease.

In all cases of surgery for liver metastases, lymph nodes draining the area of the metastases were found within the liver hilum or hepatoduodenal ligament. The average number of metinel nodes from liver metastases were 2.4, and 7 (32%) of 22 of the analyzed metinel nodes were positive for metastatic disease. Two patients underwent surgery to treat intra-abdominal local recurrences from colon cancer (patients 1 and 14); resections of the recurrence and reresection of the bowel en bloc were performed. One patient with pancreatic cancer (patient 9) underwent tumor-reducing surgery to treat a local intra-abdominal recurrence after a previous Whipple operation.

DISCUSSION
We show that it is possible to find the first lymph nodes draining various types of metastases by lymphatic mapping by means of dye or radioactive tracers. We have named these metastasis-draining lymph nodes “metinel nodes” to show both the analogy and difference to the well-known term “sentinel node,” which means the first node to receive lymphatic drainage from a primary tumor. In 19 studied cases, we demonstrated three different ways of identifying these nodes by injection of tracers subserosally around liver or intra-abdominal metastases, close to subcutaneous metastases, or into local lymph node metastases.
The fact that it is possible to expand the metinel node–derived lymphocytes via in vitro expansions during several weeks of time, together with our analysis that they contain lymphocytes that show clonal expansion toward tumor antigens and produce high levels of IFN-γ in the expansions, are evidence that they contain tumor-reactive lymphocytes. These cells are mainly T-helper 1 cells that have developed an immunological response toward the metastatic cells. We suggest that these T cells may be used in future trials of adoptive cellular therapy of disseminated solid cancer.

 Far less is known about the specific factors regulating the lymphangiogenesis around a tumor and its possible importance, much as a result of the difficulty of discriminating between lymphatics and blood vessels. However, during recent years, the molecular pathways signaling for lymphangiogenesis have been described, and these studies have revealed that lymphangiogenesis is a major component of the metastatic process.

 and that intranodal and perinodal lymphatic endothelial cell proliferation fractions were higher in metastatically involved lymph nodes. Taken together, all these findings support lymphangiogenesis in metastases.
Thus, a tumor causes an upregulation of lymphangiogenic factors that leads to an increase in peritumoral lymphatic vessels in both tumors and metastases. It is likely that these newly developed lymph vessels connect to the preexisting lymphatic vessels and lymph nodes. Shed tumor cells may invade these newly formed vessels, and the dissemination of tumor cells is facilitated. The present study shows that this process can be visualized by lymphatic mapping, and the first draining lymph node from the metastasis, the metinel node, may be identified.

 The superficial part of the liver lymphatic drainage is divided into two main directions; the posterior surface drains into pericaval nodes, and the inferior, anterior, and superior surface drains into hepatic nodes through the liver hilum. In all cases of resected liver metastases, the injections of PB were performed subserosally on the inferior, anterior, or superior surface of the liver. Our identified perihepatic metinel nodes were located corresponding to the superficial lymphatic drainage of the liver.

 demonstrated in a study of 11 patients with colorectal liver metastases that it was possible to perform lymphatic mapping by the intraoperative injection of isosulfan blue dye in a peritumoral and subcapsular manner. The basic premise was that the occurrence of extrahepatic metastases within the normal lymphatic drainage of the liver was considered to be remetastases from the colorectal metastases. They found blue-colored nodes in seven patients (54%), all within the liver hilum, falciform ligament, or gallbladder fossa. In three of these patients, the nodes were not detected by the surgeon before the mapping procedure. Like our results, they concluded that hepatic lymphatic mapping was safe, rapid, and simple technique to perform in humans.

 but to our knowledge, it has not been reported as a tool to locate lymph nodes draining subcutaneous metastases. The radioactive tracer facilitated the intraoperative identification of the metinel nodes by a gamma probe used as a complement to PB. In those cases, the lymphoscintigraphy was made days before surgery, and new injections of radioactive tracers were provided on the day of surgery. One to three metinel nodes were detected in our six patients.

The figure shows clonal expansion of Vβ 7.1, 13.2, and 20, demonstrating the presence of tumor-reactive lymphocytes toward three different types of tumor antigens.

). Our results are encouraging because the prognosis in these type of cases is usually poor.
In this study, we have shown that it is possible to find the draining lymph nodes from different types of metastases. We named these nodes “metinel nodes,” and they contain tumor-reactive lymphocytes, preferentially T-helper cells with Th1 response. We have also demonstrated that it is possible to proliferate these cells in vitro and, if the expansion procedure is successful, to use the cells for adoptive immunotherapy.
