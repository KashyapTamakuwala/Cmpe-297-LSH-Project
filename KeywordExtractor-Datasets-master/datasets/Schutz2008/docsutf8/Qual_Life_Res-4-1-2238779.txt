Background
While generic health status measures quantify the impact of all patients’ diseases on their health-related quality of life, disease specific measures focus on only one of the many conditions that a patient may have. If a patient has two diseases with similar clinical manifestations, they may respond differently to a disease-specific instrument if one of their conditions improves while the other worsens or remains stable, thus undermining the instruments in that patient population. We sought empirical evidence of the reliability and validity (including responsiveness) of the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ), a disease-specific measure for heart failure (HF), among HF patients with and without anemia, a condition that has similar symptoms to HF.

Methods
This work used a prospective cohort study of 811 HF outpatients from 58 U.S. centers with a baseline assessment of anemia of whom 698 were followed for 3 months with serial health status measures.

Conclusion
This study provides empirical evidence that the psychometric properties of the KCCQ are similar in patients with or without anemia, a potentially confounding clinical condition in patients with heart failure.

]. An unresolved challenge in the use of disease-specific measures, however, is whether they perform well when patients have other conditions that may also impact their symptoms, function, and quality of life in ways that are similar to the specific disease of interest. While this is not a problem with generic health status measures, if a co-occurring disease manifests similar effects to a primary disease of interest, and if one of the conditions worsens while the other remains stable or improves, then it is unknown whether the disease-specific measure will accurately measure the status of the disease it is designed to quantify. This can undermine the original validity, reliability and responsiveness of the disease-specific measure. One potential setting in which this type of confounding may occur is in the setting of heart failure and anemia.

]. Because of the overlap in symptomatic manifestations of both diseases, it is not clear whether heart failure-specific health status assessments, such as the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) which captures patients’ perspectives of their disease rather than physiologic or anatomic characteristics (e.g. their hematorit or left ventricular function), would perform similarly in patients with and without anemia. For example, if a patient’s heart failure symptoms improve from an increased use of diuretics, would there be an improvement in their KCCQ scores if their anemia did not change? Consequently, it is unknown whether the psychometric properties of a disease-specific HF instrument would be similar in anemic and nonanemic HF patients, given the potential for both conditions to induce similar symptoms in patients. The purpose of this analysis was to provide empirical evidence supporting the reliability and validity (including responsiveness) of the KCCQ in anemic HF patients. We sought to compare the psychometric properties, including reliability (internal consistency and test–retest) and validity (including responsiveness to clinical change), in anemic and nonanemic HF patients.

At the time of follow-up interviews, a patient global assessment of change question, asking patients to describe ‘how [they] think [their] condition has changed compared to the start of the study,’ was also asked at each follow-up interview. Responses were on a 7-point categorical response scale ranging from ‘markedly improved’ to ‘markedly worse.’ The initial 3-month assessment was used for this study because it was the closest assessment to the time of their anemia evaluation and because it had the shortest recall period with which to assess patients’ perspectives of clinical change of any of the other assessments.

Classification of anemia
Patients were classified as being anemic or not based upon their hemoglobin at the time of study enrollment. Thus, the patients’ hemoglobin value at baseline determined their anemia status throughout the remainder of the study. The World Health Organization (WHO) definition of anemia was used (hemoglobin <13 g/dl for men, <12 g/dl for women).

Statistical analysis
t
 tests for continuous variables.
To evaluate the construct validity of the KCCQ in anemic and nonanemic patients, comparisons across NYHA classifications from the baseline interviews were conducted. A two-way ANOVA with KCCQ overall summary score as the dependent variable and baseline anemia classification, NYHA, and an anemia-by-NYHA interaction term as independent variables was constructed to establish whether the association of NYHA and KCCQ was different in patients with and without anemia.

Discussion
We report empirical evidence to support the reliability and validity (including responsiveness) of the KCCQ in HF patients with anemia. We found similar associations between the KCCQ overall summary score and NYHA classification, similar internal consistency and test–retest reliability in stable patients, and similar responsiveness of the KCCQ to patients’ perceptions of 3-month clinical change. In light of the potential overlap in symptoms between anemia and HF, we tested and rejected the hypothesis that the psychometric properties of the KCCQ might differ between HF patients with and without anemia. Thus, the KCCQ could be a valid, reliable, and responsive outcome for clinical trials of anemia treatment in HF.
To date, there has been a paucity of literature examining attribution of symptoms to one of a spectrum of potentially co-occurring diseases in patient-reported health status assessments. A common recommendation for the design of clinical trials is to include both disease-specific and generic measures of health status. These recommendations are predicated upon the desire to capture the impact of treatments on a specific disease of interest, as well as the overall impact of treatment on patients’ health outside the condition of interest. The latter intended to capture side effects or other unanticipated complications of therapy.

However, these latter studies did not focus upon the ability of a disease-specific measure to be a psychometrically valid representation of the disease of interest when another co-occurring illness may manifest similar symptoms.

In summary, we provide empirical evidence to support the ability of a disease-specific measure of heart failure patients’ health status, the KCCQ, regardless of the presence of anemia. As such, we believe that patient-reported health status outcomes are a valid, reliable, and sensitive means to quantify the impact of anemia treatment on HF-specific outcomes. Given that the improvement in patients’ health status is a primary goal of treatment, being able to accurately capture HF patients’ health status in trials of anemia therapy are important. The KCCQ should be a valid and sensitive measure for accomplishing these goals.
