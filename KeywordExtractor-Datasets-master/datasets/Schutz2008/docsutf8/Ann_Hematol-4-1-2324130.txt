 = 63) and related the results to a review of the currently available literature. Polyclonal gammopathies and monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) in our adult GD I cohort were found in 41% and 19% of patients. These results are similar to the data from the literature and correspond to the increased risk of multiple myeloma (MM) that has been described. The prevalence of MGUS in our cohort increased with age but was not associated with disease severity or exposure time. The serum levels of free light chains of immunoglobulins were measured and were not found predictive for the development of MGUS or MM. Levels of pro- as well as anti-inflammatory cytokines, growth factors, and chemokines, especially those involved in inflammation and B-cell function, are disturbed in GD I, with the most impressive and consisting elevations for interleukin-10 and pulmonary and activation-regulated chemokine. A beneficial effect of ERT on the occurrence and progression of gammopathies was suggested from longitudinal data.

]. Since 1991, GD I can be effectively treated with recombinant glucocerebrosidase (enzyme replacement therapy, ERT, imiglucerase; Genzyme, Cambridge, MA, USA). More recently, substrate reduction therapy (miglustat, Actelion Pharmaceuticals, Basel, Switzerland) has been registered for more attenuated disease.

], the FLC assay may provide a useful diagnostic tool for early detection of MGUS and MM.
In this study, we present new data on the prevalence of polyclonal and monoclonal gammopathies from a large adult GD I cohort and review the currently available literature. Second, we studied whether age, disease severity, and exposure time are risk factors for the development of monoclonal gammopathies, and if this risk is subsequently decreased by the administration of ERT. In addition, for the first time, we investigated the role of FLC as a predictor of the development of monoclonal gammopathies in GD I. Finally, the pathogenesis of immunoglobulin abnormalities in GD patients was studied by means of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine, chemokine, and growth factor levels and is discussed in relation to previous literature.

]), creatinine, urea, chitotriosidase, and the presence and type of immunoglobulin class of monoclonal proteins were collected. In patients with a monoclonal gammopathy, exposure time was defined as the number of years between the diagnosis GD I and the diagnosis monoclonal gammopathy or start of ERT, whichever came first. In patients without a monoclonal gammopathy, exposure time was calculated as the number of years between the diagnosis GD I and start of therapy, or, in patients not receiving therapy, the first visit to our clinic.

We investigated whether levels of FLC could be predictive for the development of MGUS and whether these levels were related to disease severity. Therefore, we measured FLC levels in serum before start of enzyme replacement therapy in ten patients with mild GD (SSI ≤ 8) and ten patients with severe GD (SSI ≥ 9), all without a monoclonal gammopathy.
In addition, we studied whether changes in cytokine levels and in FLC and immunoglobulins at baseline and during ERT were related to the presence or absence of a monoclonal gammopathy. Therefore, the group of patients with a monoclonal gammopathy was matched for age, sex, spleen status, SSI, and the use of ERT to a control group of GD patients without a monoclonal gammopathy. Serial measurements of levels of IL-6, IL-10, and PARC at baseline and after 12, 24, and a median of 114 months of ERT (range 40–143, whatever was the last determination) were performed. These were related to changes in immunoglobulins and free light chains. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) was measured only at baseline. One patient did not receive therapy; the first hospital visit was used as T0.

]. Monoclonal FLC were identified as values for κ or λ that exceeded the reference ranges (κ 6.2–30.2 mg/l, λ 9.1–40 mg/l) and produced an abnormal κ/λ ratio (<0.3 or >1.57). Elevated concentrations of FLC without an abnormal κ/λ ratio indicate a polyclonal or oligoclonal increase of FLC. Levels of IgG, IgA, and IgM were measured by immunoturbidimetric assay (Roche Tina-quant). IL-6, IL-10, HGF, and PARC were measured by specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), according to the instructions of the manufacturer (IL-6 and IL-10: Sanquin, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; HGF: R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA; PARC: Biosource International, Camarillo, CA, USA).

Search strategy
To compare the prevalence of poly- and monoclonal gammopathies in our cohort with earlier case series and to study the relative risk of MM, we performed a MEDLINE search combining the MESH terms Gaucher disease with either hypergammaglobulinemia, paraproteinemias, and/or multiple myeloma. Literature on cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors in relation to the development of immunoglobulin abnormalities in GD were searched combining the MESH terms Gaucher disease with cytokines and/or chemokines. Case reports were excluded and only studies that included at least ten patients were selected.


Results
Patients
The 63 patients had a median age of 53 years (range 25–83). Thirty-two of patients (51%) were men, and 23 (37%) were splenectomized. At baseline, median SSI was 8 (range 3–19). The majority of patients had a genotype containing N370S (95%), with N370S/L444P being the most common combination (40%). All patients had creatinine and urea values within the normal range.

Of the 12 patients with MGUS, two developed MM and/or amyloidosis after approximately 2 years of ERT (#1 and 3). Patient #1 was diagnosed with MM and amyloidosis 25 months after start of ERT. Pulse therapy with dexamethasone was started. Three months after the diagnosis the patient died from cardiac failure. At 24 months after start of ERT, patient #3 was diagnosed with amyloidosis. She received melphalan and prednisone, but died 12 months later from cardiac failure. Patient #2 was diagnosed with MM stage IA before start of ERT. During follow-up, IgG levels gradually increased. After 7 years of ERT, treatment with reduced dose melphalan and prednisone was started, which resulted in unacceptable cytopenia. Subsequently, thalidomide, 100 mg daily, was started with beneficial effect and stable disease parameters for the last 3 years.

The remaining four patients with MGUS had both FLC levels as well as a FLC κ/λ ratio within the normal range. Six of the patients from the control group had FLC levels and a FLC κ/λ ratio within the normal range, and six had elevated levels of one or both chains of whom only one (#co6) patient showed an abnormal FLC κ/λ ratio. During follow-up (range 6–15 years), none of the patients from the control group developed a monoclonal gammopathy.

More specifically, immunoglobulin levels remained stable or decreased in all patients, except for patient #11, who showed an increase in IgM. This patient was different from other MGUS patients because she did not receive therapy. Free light chain levels were more variable, but clearly FLC levels of patients who were to develop or already suffered from MM and/or amyloidosis remained high during ERT (#1–3). Although in most patients no trends could be distinguished, a consistent decrease in free light chains and immunogobulins was seen for example in patient 7, who had an IgAκ M protein. This patient responded very well to ERT, but other patients with excellent clinical responses did not always show a similar decrease in M-protein levels. No relationship was found between clinical response and decrease in either levels of immunoglobulins or FLCs.
The course of cytokines did not show a relationship with changes in either FLC or immunoglobulin levels, although in the untreated patient with increasing levels of IgM (#11), also an increase in IL-6 and PARC was noted. On the contrary, a spontaneous decrease in IL-6 was found in patient #2, without therapy for his MM. In patient #1, IL-10 showed a clear decrease after start of ERT but before the diagnosis amyloidosis and MM was made.

], who investigated 16 patients aged 9 to 70 years and established an MGUS in four patients, all being over 50 years of age. Indirectly, he also showed an association with severity of disease, since all patients with splenomegaly had either a monoclonal or polyclonal gammopathy.

]. We found that the three GD patients who had or would soon develop a B-cell malignancy could easily be identified by their strongly abnormal FLC κ/λ ratios. It was however, not possible to identify GD patients with MGUS on the basis of abnormal FLCs since 44% of GD patients with MGUS had both FLC levels as well as a FLC κ/λ ratio within the normal range. A slightly abnormal ratio was not predictive for progression to MM or MGUS in the single patient without a monoclonal gammopathy, even after 15 years of follow-up. None of the patients had a decrease in renal function, implicating that any FLC increase was indeed due to increased production by plasma cells.
MGUS patients are at risk for developing MM at a rate of 1% of patients per year. Accordingly, the prevalence of MM in GD I cohorts of 0.4–1.5% clearly exceeds the general prevalence of 0.02% (deduced from The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program of the National Cancer Institute (NCI)). The assumed diversity in relative risk of developing MM (5.9 and 51.1) can simply be explained by age differences in the cohorts: the highest number of MM patients was clearly established in the highest age groups.

This would require an international multicenter effort that should aim to establish whether indeed these long-term complications can be prevented by ERT and whether this would justify the early start of treatment.
In summary, there is a high prevalence in GD I of both polyclonal as well as monoclonal gammopathies, including MM. The risk of these diseases increases with age. Mechanisms causing gammopathies remain to be elucidated, but include the disturbance of cytokine levels involved in inflammation and B-cell function. ERT is likely to have a beneficial effect in preventing the occurrence and the progression of gammopathies.
