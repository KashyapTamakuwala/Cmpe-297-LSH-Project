In this study, we have combined data on clavicle fusion from different studies and applied a binomial logistic regression analysis. As such, we aimed to assess whether or not variables such as sex, socioeconomic status, and ethnicity influence the probability of having mature, i.e., completely fused clavicles at a given age. We further explored whether the method of clavicle examination, i.e., diagnosis from either a dry bone specimen, an examination of X-rays, or an examination of computed tomography scans, affects the probability of being diagnosed with mature clavicles. It appeared that only ethnicity did not significantly affect this probability. Finally, we illustrated how the logit model may be used to predict the probability of being diagnosed with mature clavicles.

]. In a number of studies, the results for different ethnic groups were evaluated or the results for males were compared with those for females. In most studies, such comparisons were, however, hampered by a relatively small sample size.
In this study, we aim to assess from a large sample whether or not variables such as sex, socioeconomic status, and ethnicity affect the probability of having completely fused clavicles at a certain age. We further aim to compare results from X-ray and CT scan examinations with those from studies based on dry bone specimens. To do so, we have combined data from different studies and performed a binomial logistic regression analysis. We then illustrate how the resulting model can be applied to estimate the probability of completely fused clavicles at a given age.

] were combined. For each individual, information on the calendar age in years was combined with data on the fusion status of the clavicle, i.e., exhibiting a complete bony fusion of epiphysis and diaphysis (i.e., mature) or not. When data for both left and right clavicles were published, we used the side for which most records were provided. Data on the sex and ethnicity of the individuals were copied when available. In the context of this study, we defined ethnicity as being either of European (Caucasian), Asian, or Afro-American descent. It was further recorded which method was used for determining the fusion status, i.e., using dry bone specimens, X-rays, or CT scans.

Statistical analysis
Analysis of the data was performed using the SPSS (version 10.0) software package for statistical analysis. We carried out a binomial logistic regression analysis to assess the effect of various variables on the probability of mature clavicles. In logistic regression, the dependent variable is transformed into a logit variable, i.e., the natural log of the odds of the dependent occurring or not. This transformation ensures that the estimated probabilities are between 0 and 1. A logit model is a form of the generalized linear model.

Model M3, which could be fitted to all available data on clavicle fusion, resulted in comparable model parameters for the dummy variable for CT scans. Confounding by an observer effect is therefore reduced.

Based on the currently available data on clavicle fusion, we can now predict the probability of having mature clavicles for different individuals. Here, we provide a few examples.
The predicted probability of mature clavicles is 0.016 (1.6%) for a contemporary 19-year-old German male (HDI is 0.932). For a 20- or 21-year-old German male, this probability increases to 0.029 (2.9%) and 0.054 (5.4%), respectively. For females, the predicted probability values are increased to 0.023 (2.3%), 0.042 (4.2%), and 0.076 (7.6%), respectively. However, if the individuals have a lower socioeconomic status, these values are decreased. For contemporary 19-, 20-, and 21-year-old males from India (HDI is 0.611), for instance, they are 0.007 (0.7%), 0.012 (1.2%), and 0.023 (2.3%), respectively. When diagnosed from X-ray or CT scan, the values increase. For the 21-year-old Indian male, it would be 0.040 (4%) if diagnosed from an X-ray and 0.076 (7.6%) if diagnosed from a CT scan (composed using a slice thickness that is far from optimal).

]. There was no indication of significant interaction between sex and age. We may therefore assume similarly shaped probability curves for males and females, indicating an equal number of years during which complete fusion may generally be achieved.

].
The method of clavicle examination appeared to also be significant. The significant interaction term method × age indicates that we should assume a difference in the estimated effect of age depending on the method applied. For the age interval in which mature clavicles have been observed, the predicted probability of being diagnosed with mature clavicles is greater when X-rays or CT scans are used instead of dry bone specimens. It is noteworthy that the difference in the predicted probability is initially very small, but becomes increasingly greater with increasing age during a limited age interval. When keeping in mind that the curve for the predicted probability will be s-shaped, one may image that the difference is again only minimal for the older individuals.
A number of theories can be postulated to explain a difference in the predicted probabilities between methods of examination.
Inappropriate slice thickness

]—from whom no data were included in our analysis, as no individual data were provided—observed two 19-year-olds with completely fused clavicles. Both observations were done from reconstructions with a slice thickness of 7 mm (Schulze, personal communication). We therefore think there is a realistic possibility of these cases having been misdiagnosed.
Persistent small grooves or notches between diaphysis and epiphysis

] hypothesized that persistent small grooves or notches seen in dry bone specimens may be classified as partial fusions of the epiphysis with the clavicular shaft. This would reduce the probability of dry bone specimens being classified as completely fused.
Reduced visibility of the epiphyseal disc on X-rays
 X-rays used in the published studies have not been made with the purpose of examining the clavicles. Possibly, this has hindered a correct classification of the clavicle at times.
Interobserver variability
 As the sample included results from two studies based on X-rays and two studies based on CT scans, we hold it unlikely that what we perceive to be an effect of the applied method is in fact an observer effect.
Expectation bias

], the examiner was not aware of the age of the subjects when classifying the images. We therefore do not believe that expectation bias could have played a role of any great importance.
Statistical artifact
shape
 of the probability curve. In case of misclassifications of nearly fused clavicles or differences in the classification system among studies, we would have expected a higher number of individuals with completely fused clavicles in the relatively young subjects, even below the age of 20.If we, however, were to conclude that significance of the interaction term is in fact a statistical artifact, the term should be removed from the model, and model parameters should be recalculated. It is our ambition to investigate the matter further by comparing high quality CT scans, expected to allow a correct diagnosis, with X-rays taken from the same person.

Conclusions
The probability of having mature clavicles at a certain age is affected by the sex and socioeconomic status of the individual. The probability of being diagnosed with mature clavicles further appears affected by the method of clavicle examination. Predicted probabilities from the model may be used to illustrate acceptance or rejection of individual age claims.
Please note that the odds on having mature clavicles given a certain age should not be confused with the (posterior) odds of having reached a certain age given that the clavicles have matured. These probabilities are only equal if we assume a prior odds of 1.
