In the study reported here, we investigated data from 500 children with IgA-N to determine whether the long-term outcome has improved in Japanese children with IgA-N.

Methods
Patients
The medical history of children under the age of 20 years who underwent routine renal biopsies at Kobe University and Wakayama Medical University hospitals between January 1976 and December 2004 were analyzed retrospectively. Clinical data and follow-up information were obtained from the medical records, and if needed, further complementary information was obtained by telephone contact with the patients, family members and or physicians.

]: diffuse mesangial proliferation was defined as more than 80% of glomeruli showing moderate or severe mesangial cell proliferation, i.e. more than three cells per peripheral mesangial area; focal mesangial proliferation was defined as less than 80% of glomeruli showing moderate or severe mesangial cell proliferation. All children with IgA-N were diagnosed by one investigator (N.Y.) using the same criteria during the entire study period. Renal biopsies were performed in children with persistent proteinuria (early morning urine protein/creatinine ratio ≥0.2g/g) with or without hematuria. Renal biopsy criteria were not changed during the entire study period.
Renal survival was defined as the period from the time of apparent disease onset to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring renal replacement therapy.
Given the change of policy for treating IgA-N patients in the early 1990s, we divided the study period when the initial renal biopsy had been performed into two time periods: 1976–1989 (early period) and 1990–2004 (late period).

For the treatment of children with mild IgA-N showing focal mesangial proliferation we started a RCT by the JPIGANTS in 1990. During this trial (1990–1993) about half of the children with mild IgA-N in our hospitals received Sairei-to, a Chinese herb, for 24 months, and the other half received no medication. We began to use ACEIs for treatment of mild IgA-N with focal mesangial proliferation as the first choice from the beginning of 2000.

Results
Patients
Between 1976 and 2004, 1759 children underwent a first renal biopsy examination at the Kobe University and Wakayama Medical University hospitals. Among these, 500 Japanese children (28.4%; 279 boys and 221 girls) were diagnosed as having IgA-N: 219 in 1976–1989 and 281 in 1990–2004. There was no evident change in the number of patients per year between the early (1976–1989) and late (1990–2004) periods. The median patient age at diagnosis was 10.9 years (range 2.5–19.6 years), and the median follow-up period for the patients overall was 5.9 years (range 1.3–20.5 years).

Discussion
Although this was a retrospective study, the data seem to provide unique and valuable information about IgA-N in children for several reasons. First, the study subjects were a complete non-selected cohort of patients with IgA-N from among all children who underwent first renal biopsy examinations at Kobe University and Wakayama Medical University hospitals between 1976 and 2004. Five hundred children with IgA-N participated in our study, which to our knowledge is the largest series used to investigate the outcome of IgA-N in children to date. Furthermore, these patients were diagnosed histologically by a single investigator (N.Y.) based on the same criteria during the whole study period. Renal biopsy criteria were also unchanged during the whole study period. Therefore, the cohort in the present study is considered to have been rigidly homogeneous in terms of the analysis of the disease outcome.

], and the third RCT of treatment for children with severe IgA-N showing diffuse mesangial proliferation is currently being conducted by the same group. For the treatment of children with mild IgA-N and focal mesangial proliferation, a RCT was also started by the JPIGANTS in 1990. After completion of the RCT, we have conducted prospective clinical trials of treatment for children with mild IgA-N and focal mesangial proliferation. These prospective trials have enabled for us to clarify the optimum treatment for IgA-N and to collect precise information on patients with IgA-N.

This multivariate analysis indicated that the initial renal biopsy year was a significant factor for ESRD-free survival after adjustment of these baseline characteristics. These data support an improvement of renal survival in Japanese children with IgA-N.

). This improvement may be related to the 2-year therapy, including corticosteroids, for all patients with IgA-N showing diffuse mesangial proliferation as a treatment policy, although in principle the effectiveness of any treatment can only be evaluated properly by a controlled trial. It is conceivable that the outcome in the period 1976–1989 may have reflected the natural course of disease, whereas that in 1990–2004 may have reflected modification of the disease course by the treatments.
The median follow-up period of the patients overall was 5.9 years (range 1.3–20.5 years). Although this is a considerably long period, it may not be sufficiently long for the follow-up of IgA-N, which has a slow progressive course. Since the elapsed time from apparent disease onset to ESRD was used to evaluate the disease outcome, chronic renal insufficiency before ESRD was not considered in our study. Thus, we do not know whether the observed improvement of outcome means a complete cure of the disease or merely a delay of the disease course. Further follow-up of the cohort for a long period is therefore important.
One aspect which we should consider in our study is the possibility that at least some of the differences in outcome between the early and late groups may be due to general changes in care that have occurred over time. Such changes are frequently not recognized, such as a gradually greater awareness of managing marginally raised blood pressure, among others.
In conclusion, this study has demonstrated a substantial improvement of long-term renal survival in Japanese children with IgA-N. On the basis of the results of this study we were unable to provide the reason for this improved outcome directly; however, it is likely that adequate management using a strict policy of treatment may have been responsible.
