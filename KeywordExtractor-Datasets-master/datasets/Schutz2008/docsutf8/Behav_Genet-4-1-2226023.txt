Heritability estimates of birth weight have been inconsistent. Possible explanations are heritability changes during gestational age or the influence of covariates (e.g. chorionicity). The aim of this study was to model birth weights of twins across gestational age and to quantify the genetic and environmental components. We intended to reduce the common environmental variance to increase heritability and thereby the chance of identifying candidate genes influencing the genetic variance of birth weight. Perinatal data were obtained from 4232 live-born twin pairs from the East Flanders Prospective Twin Survey, Belgium. Heritability of birth weights across gestational ages was estimated using a non-linear multivariate Gaussian regression with covariates in the means model and in covariance structure. Maternal, twin-specific, and placental factors were considered as covariates. Heritability of birth weight decreased during gestation from 25 to 42 weeks. However, adjusting for covariates increased the heritability over this time period, with the highest heritability for first-born twins of multipara with separate placentas, who were staying alive (from 52% at 25 weeks to 30% at 42 weeks). Twin-specific factors revealed latent genetic components, whereas placental factors explained common and unique environmental factors. The number of placentas and site of the insertion of the umbilical cord masked the effect of chorionicity. Modeling genetic and environmental factors leads to a better estimate of their role in growth during gestation. For birth weight, mainly environmental factors were explained, resulting in an increase of the heritability and thereby the chance of finding genes influencing birth weight in linkage and association studies.

). As a consequent, heritability of birth weight may change over gestational age or different covariates may explain different parts of the variance-covariance structure. For example, it is more likely that at 37 weeks of gestation, nutrient factors (environmental factor) will explain a larger part of the covariance matrix as compared to 13 weeks of gestation.

The aim of this twin study was to model birth weight across gestational ages and to quantify the genetic and environmental components in order to explain the effects of covariates on the variance of birth weight. We hypothesize that heritability changes during gestation and that covariates mainly explain the common environmental and residual factors of the variance. By entering these covariates in the means model and in the covariance matrix, heritability will increase and, as a consequence, the power to find genes by linkage and association studies will increase, although the effects of each covariate on the genetic and environmental component may be different.

Because in 1964 all gestational ages were based on the last menstruation, while in 2002 almost all gestational ages were based on first trimester ultrasound and this might influence gestational age, we controlled for birth year.

). Because the modeling process is exploratory, the inference criterion used for comparing the models under consideration is their ability to fit the observed data; i.e. models are compared directly through their minimized minus log likelihood. When the numbers of parameters in models differ, they are penalized by adding the number of estimated parameters. Smaller values indicate more preferable models. This criterion allows direct comparison among models, which are not required to be nested.

Effect of each separate covariate on the genetic and environmental component
To explain the effect of each covariate on the (co-)variance of birth weight at different gestational ages, we removed a significant covariate completely from the full model (out of the mean regression and out of the covariance matrix) and compared the (co-)variances, so that the influence of that specific covariate became apparent.

Effect of each separate covariate on the genetic and environmental component
Comparing the variances of the full model with and without a specific covariate showed that maternal factors (age and parity) had minor influence on the genetic variance, but no influence on heritability. Removing sex, birth order and neonatal survival gave an increase in genetic variance. However, only for sex, heritability increased if removed from the model. Removing the placental factors from the full means model resulted in a decrease of the genetic variance and a decrease of heritability. Insertion of the umbilical cord (unique for each twin) explained mainly the unique environmental variance, whereas number of placentas also explained common environment.

Discussion
The aim of this study was to model birth weight at different gestational ages and quantify the genetic and environmental components. To our knowledge we are the first to show that heritability of birth weight seems to decrease during gestation, in our case from 38% at 25 weeks to 15% at 42 weeks. Entering the covariates of the mean regression as moderators in the covariance matrix, explained more of the common environmental variance than of the genetic variance. However, the unique environmental variance depended upon the representative state of the covariates and was lowest for first-born twins of multipara with two separate placentas, who stayed alive neonatally. Therefore these twins have the highest heritability: from 52% at 25 weeks to 30% at 42 weeks.

). Parity is common for both twins, but because of the interaction with birth order in the mean regression, parity explains part of the unique environmental variance.
Covariates also contain useful information in order to identify genes, which may be associated with the trait. In this study, only sex contained latent genetic information. For all other covariates used in this study, either heritability did not change, or environmental factors were explained with heritability depending on the representative state of the covariate. Since sex explained part of heritability, entering sex in the means model will mask genes that act differently according to sex and it is better to have these genes in the model instead of sex.

In conclusion, modeling genetic and environmental factors gives a better insight in factors influencing growth during gestation, and therefore birth weight. Heritability of birth weight changed during gestation with a decrease from 25 to 42 weeks with highest heritability for twins with the least environmental restriction (first-born twins of multipara with two separate placentas who stayed alive neonatally). For this complex trait, modeling the covariance matrix with covariates, mainly environmental factors were explained, resulting in an increase of the heritability and subsequently the chance of finding genes by linkage and association studies.
