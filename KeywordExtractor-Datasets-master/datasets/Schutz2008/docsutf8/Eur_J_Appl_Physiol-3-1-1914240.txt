 = 7) with exceptional ability for maximal voluntary activation (VA) of the knee extensors were used to study the relationship between superimposed and voluntary torque. This includes very high contraction intensities (90–100%VA), which are difficult to consistently obtain in regular healthy subjects (VA of ∼90%). Subjects were tested at 30, 60, and 90° knee angles on two experimental days. At each angle, isometric knee extensions were performed with supramaximal superimposed nerve stimulation (triplet: three pulses at 300 Hz). Surface EMG signals were obtained from rectus femoris, vastus lateralis, and medialis muscles. Maximal VA was similar and very high across knee angles: 97 ± 2.3% (mean ± SD). At high contraction intensities, the increase in voluntary torque was far greater than would be expected based on the decrement of superimposed torque. When voluntary torque increased from 79.6 ± 6.1 to 100%MVC, superimposed torque decreased from 8.5 ± 2.6 to 2.8 ± 2.3% of resting triplet. Therefore, an increase in VA of 5.7% (from 91.5 ± 2.6 to 97 ± 2.3%) coincided with a much larger increase in voluntary torque (20.4 ± 6.1%MVC) and EMG (33.9 ± 6.6%max). Moreover, a conventionally assessed VA of 91.5 ± 2.6% represented a voluntary torque of only 79.6 ± 6.1%MVC. In conclusion, when maximal VA is calculated to be ∼90% (as in regular healthy subjects), this probably represents a considerable overestimation of the subjects’ ability to maximally drive their quadriceps muscles.

); for the adductor pollicis muscle they show that large increases of motoneuronal excitation near MVC will be accompanied by only minor reductions in the size of the superimposed force. At high contraction intensities, therefore, the %VA does not necessarily represent the same percentage of the muscles’ maximal torque capacity. The first aim of the present study was therefore to assess the relationship between calculated VA and voluntary torque of the knee extensors at high contraction intensities. To achieve the best possible assessment of the relationship between conventionally assessed VA and voluntary torque (as %MVC), in the present study, only those individuals capable of consistently high levels of maximal VA were included.

). Therefore, particularly at short muscle lengths, scaling the superimposed torque response to the response obtained at rest may lead to a relatively lower calculated VA at short (extended knee angles) compared to long muscle lengths (flexed knee angles).

) EMG–torque relationships have been reported. Therefore, this study further aims to investigate the EMG–torque relationship of the knee extensors in subjects with high ability for VA.

Methods
Subjects
Seven healthy male subjects (23–32 year, 69–83 kg, and 1.73–1.93 m) volunteered to be subjects for this investigation. Before participation, each subject was thoroughly informed about the procedures and provided written informed consent prior to testing. Only subjects capable of >95%VA across knee angles (see below) were included in the present study. The study was performed according to the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the local ethics committee. Subjects did not perform any fatiguing exercise 48 h prior to measurements.

Experimental procedures

). During the first experimental day, several contractions with superimposed stimulation (see below) were performed at 30° (extended) and 60 and 90° (flexed) knee angles. At the same time, surface EMG of the rectus femoris (RF), vastus lateralis (VL), and vastus medialis (VM) was recorded. To gain information concerning test-retest variability, the experimental procedure performed on experimental day 1 was repeated during experimental day 2.

deg/Nm. The backrest, force transducer height, and its medio-lateral position were adjusted for precise alignment of the knee axis with the axis of rotation of the dynamometer arm. A crank enabled changing of the knee angle of the subject. Knee joint angles were determined with a handheld goniometer (model G300, Whitehall Manufacturing) using the greater trochanter and lateral epicondyle of the femur, and the lateral malleolus of the fibula as references. The dynamometer arm was positioned so that the indicated knee angles were angles in an active state, with subjects delivering ∼50% of MVC. During pilot experiments using an electrogoniometer attached to the lateral side of the knee, the changes (active–passive) in knee angle were found to be 3–7°, independent of knee angle, with minimal (<1°) changes above ∼50% of MVC. Real-time force applied to the force transducer was displayed on line on a computer monitor and digitally stored (1 kHz) on computer disc. The force signals were automatically corrected for gravity at each angle: the average force applied by the weight of the limb to the transducer during the first 50 ms after the start of a recording, with the subject seated in a relaxed manner, was set to zero force by the computer program. Extension torque was calculated by multiplication of force with the individual lever arm and data will be presented as torque.

). After shaving, roughening, and cleansing the skin with 70% ethanol, electrodes were placed on the muscle belly in a bi-polar configuration in line with the muscle fibre direction with a centre to centre inter-electrode distance of 25 mm. Reference electrodes were placed on bone structures, on each patella, and on the lateral epicondyle of the femur of the right leg. Surface EMG signals were amplified (×100), digitized (1 kHz), and stored with the force signal on computer disc. All EMG signals were band-pass filtered (10–400 Hz). Rectified surface EMG amplitude (rsEMG) was calculated for the RF, VL, and VM for 1,000 ms segments just before the superimposed stimulation. RsEMG values obtained during the highest torque level on each experimental day were set to 100%.

). A VA of 90.0% is also calculated at 240 Nm for subject no. 1. In both subjects, this implies a further potential increase in torque of 10%, yet a >30% torque increase (to 330 Nm) could be demonstrated in subject 1. This is most likely due to the exceptional neural drive of subject 1 (∼98%VA) during his best attempts at this knee angle

Discussion
In the present study, the relationship between calculated VA and voluntary torque was assessed in subjects with high ability for maximal VA at different knee angles. At the same time, the EMG–torque relationship in these selected subjects was examined. The first and main finding of the present study was that when VA is calculated to be ∼90% (as in regular healthy subjects), this probably represents a considerable overestimation of the subjects’ ability to maximally drive their quadriceps muscles. An additional finding was that, although resting triplet torque was lower at 30° versus 90°, this was of minor influence on the calculated maximal VA in our subjects. Furthermore, a relatively large increase in normalized rsEMG was observed as MVC was approached, making the shape of the normalized EMG–torque relationship of the knee extensors curvilinear.

), which ensured a good signal-to-noise ratio. Furthermore, pilot studies had shown no increase in triplet torque before and after an MVC at any knee angle. By using supramaximal and high frequency (300 Hz) triplet stimulation, we avoided the potential influence of post-activation potentiation on our data.

), leading to an even greater difference in resting twitch size at 30° versus 90°. Combined with the use of a resting twitch, therefore, a muscle length-dependent effect of tendon slack is expected to significantly influence the calculation of VA in this subject population.

a). The small decreases in modelled interpolated twitch amplitude are also consistent with the current findings, where the triplet torque increment was only 3.2 ± 1.1%MVC at a torque level that corresponded to 79.6 ± 6.1%MVC and showed only a minor further reduction in size (to 1.0 ± 0.9%MVC).

How can we be certain that our selected subjects did indeed approach their true MTC? The only way to truly determine the MTC of a muscle is by the use of tetanic nerve stimulation. In two subjects with exceptional ability for maximal VA (>99%), supramaximal tetanic nerve stimulation (2 s, at 150 Hz) of the knee extensors was performed and torque levels showed no further increase above MVC (data not presented). Applying supramaximal tetanic nerve stimulation is not recommended, however, as it is highly unpleasant and could be harmful to certain vulnerable subject groups (e.g. subjects with an ACL deficiency).

In conclusion, when maximal VA is calculated to be ∼90% (as in regular healthy subjects), this probably represents a considerable overestimation of the subjects’ ability to maximally drive their quadriceps muscles. Moreover, the effect that the length dependent size of the resting triplet has on the calculation of VA with the conventional method is only minimal when VA is greater than 95%. Furthermore, a curvilinear shape of the EMG–force relationship may be caused by a disproportionately large increase in normalized rsEMG when MVC is approached in subjects with very high capacity to drive their muscles maximally.
