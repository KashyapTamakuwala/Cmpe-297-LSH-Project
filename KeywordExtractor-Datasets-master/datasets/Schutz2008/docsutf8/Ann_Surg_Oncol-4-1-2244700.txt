Purpose
Aurora-A, also known as STK15/BTAK, is a member of the protein serine/threonine kinase family, and experimental studies have revealed that Aurora-A plays critical roles in cell mitosis and in carcinogenesis. However, no clinical studies on Aurora-A expression in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have been reported. Thus, the present study was conducted to assess the clinical significance of Aurora-A status.

Experimental Design
A total of 189 consecutive patients with resected pathologic (p-)stage I-IIIA, NSCLC were retrospectively reviewed, and immunohistochemical staining was used to detect Aurora-A expression.

Results
P
P
 = .033). Subset analyses revealed that perimembrane Aurora-A expression was a significant factor to predict a poor prognosis in squamous cell carcinoma patients, not in adenocarcinoma patients. A multivariate analysis confirmed that perimembrane Aurora-A expression was an independent and significant factor to predict a poor prognosis.

Conclusions
Perimembrane Aurora-A status was a significant factor to predict a poor prognosis in correlation with enhanced proliferative activity in NSCLC.

 Thus, other molecular abnormalities in NSCLC should be revealed in the development of useful prognostic markers and in the development of effective molecular targeting agents.

 These results may suggest that clinical significant of Aurora-A status in malignant tumors remains controversial. Moreover, no clinical study on Aurora-A status in NSCLC has been reported. Thus, we conducted a clinical study on Aurora-A expression in resected NSCLC and assessed its clinical significance in correlation with other biomarkers including proliferative activity.
Patients and Methods
Patients

 Histological type was also redetermined according to the classification by the World Health Organization (WHO) as revised in 2004. Two patients who experienced operation-related death were excluded from the study. Thus, a total of 189 patients were finally evaluated in the present study. For all these patients, the inpatient medical records, chest x-ray films, whole-body computed tomography (CT) films, bone and gallium scanning data, and records of surgery were reviewed without knowledge of the results of immunohistochemical staining (IHS) or the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end-labeling (TUNEL) staining.
23
24
 In brief, cisplatin-based chemotherapy, radiation, and oral administration of tegafur (a fluorouracil derivative drug) were prescribed postoperatively for 47, 30, and 49 patients, respectively. Intraoperative therapy was not performed on any patient.
The day of thoracotomy was considered the starting day for counting postoperative survival days. The median and mean follow-up periods were 1697 and 1983 days, respectively (range, 50–6381 days). This study has been approved by the Ethics Committee of Faculty of Medicine, Kyoto University.

Tissue Preparation
All tumor specimens were fixed immediately in 10 vol% formalin, and then embedded in paraffin. Serial 4-μm sections were prepared from each sample and used for routine hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining, the TUNEL staining to detect apoptotic cells, and IHS to determine Aurora-A expression status, p53 status, intratumoral microvessel density (IMVD), and proliferative index (PI).

Immunohistochemistry
Aurora-A expression was evaluated using a standard streptavidin-biotinylated horseradish peroxidase detection system. Dewaxed sections were incubated overnight with a rabbit polyclonal antibody (KR051, Transgenic Co. Ltd., Kumamoto, Japan; it had been produced and its reliability had been confirmed by western blotting on a commercial basis) diluted at 1:100. Diaminobenzidine-tetrahydrochloride (0.03%) containing 0.1% hydrogen peroxide was used as a chromogen, and sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. For negative control slides, rabbit immunoglobulin G was used instead of the primary antibody. Colon cancer sections that are known to express Aurora-A were used as positive control slides.

Detection of Apoptosis
23
 The specificity of the TUNEL staining of apoptotic cells was confirmed by making the negative and the positive control slides at every staining. As negative control slides, sections incubated with the TUNEL reaction mixture without TdT were used. Sections treated with DNase I (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) before the TUNEL reaction were used as positive control slides. Apoptotic cells were determined with careful observation of TUNEL-staining sections and serial HE-staining sections, and TUNEL-positive staining cells, if they represented the histological features of necrosis in HE-staining sections, were not considered to be apoptotic cells. In each case, a total of 10,000 tumor cells, consisting of 1000 tumor cells each in 10 different fields, were evaluated at high magnification (400×). The apoptotic index (AI) was defined as the number of apoptotic cells per 1000 tumor cells.

); when perimembrane Aurora-A expression was separated and analyzed, tumors with perimembrane Aurora-A expression showed an aggressive tumor phenotype correlated with a higher PI and a poor prognosis. The biochemical implication of perimembrane Aurora-A expression is unknown, staining patterns should be taken into consideration in evaluation of Aurora-A expression status in clinical samples.
