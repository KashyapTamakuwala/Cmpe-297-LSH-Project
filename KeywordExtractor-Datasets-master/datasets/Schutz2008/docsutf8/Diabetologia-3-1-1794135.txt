Aims/hypothesis
Adiponectin is an adipokine with insulin-sensitising and anti-atherogenic properties. Several reports suggest that genetic variants in the adiponectin gene are associated with circulating levels of adiponectin, insulin sensitivity and type 2 diabetes risk. Recently two receptors for adiponectin have been cloned. Genetic studies have yielded conflicting results on the role of these genes and type 2 diabetes predisposition. In this study we aimed to evaluate the potential role of genetic variation in these genes in syndromes of severe insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes and in related metabolic traits in UK Europid populations.

 were detected in the cohort of patients with severe insulin resistance. None of the 24 polymorphisms (allele frequency 2.3–48.3%) tested was associated with type 2 diabetes in the case–control study. Similarly, none of the polymorphisms was associated with fasting plasma insulin, fasting and 2-h post-load plasma glucose, 30-min insulin increment or BMI.

Conclusions/interpretation
ADIPOR1
ADIPOR2
 is not a major cause of extreme insulin resistance in humans, nor does it contribute in a significant manner to type 2 diabetes risk and related traits in UK Europid populations.

. Following PCR, performed using standard conditions, products were purified using exonuclease I and shrimp alkaline phosphatase (USB Corporation, Cleveland, OH, USA), and bi-directional sequencing was performed using a DNA sequencing kit (Big Dye Terminator 3.1; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Sequencing reactions were run on ABI3700 capillary machines (Applied Biosystems) and sequences were analysed using Mutation Surveyor version.2.20 (SoftGenetics LLC, State College, PA, USA).

Genotyping
SNP selection
 All SNPs with a minor allele frequency greater than 2% in our SIR cohort were selected for genotyping. To increase coverage in areas not re-sequenced, a number of dbSNPs were selected in an attempt to eliminate gaps, between genotyped SNPs, of greater than 2.5–3 kb on average (additional SNPs were selected prior to HapMap phase I data release). SNP choice was based on the following criteria: (1) all putative non-synonymous SNPs in dbSNP were selected irrespective of whether or not there was frequency or validation information for the SNP; (2) SNPs with frequency information were selected if their minor allele frequency was greater than or equal to 5%; (3) for SNPs with no frequency information the choice was based on whether the SNP was a double-hit SNP, had been validated by-cluster or by-submitter; and finally (4) some SNPs with no validation information were included to try and eliminate gaps of greater than 2.5–3 kb between SNPs selected for genotyping.

However, given that both reported associated SNPs are present in all populations, it is unlikely that either is the true causal variant, although they could be detecting, through LD, the effect of an untested SNP. Alternatively, given the relative small sample sizes used and lack of adjustment for multiple testing, the authors may have reported a false–positive association.
