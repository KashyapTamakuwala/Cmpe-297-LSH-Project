Objects
Deliberate termination of life of newborns (involuntary euthanasia) with meningomyelocele (MMC) is practiced openly only in the Netherlands. ‘Unbearable and hopeless suffering’ is the single most cited criterion for this termination, together with the notion that ‘there are no other proper medical means to alleviate this suffering’. In this paper, both (and other) statements are questioned, also by putting them in a broader perspective.

Methods
First, a historical overview of the treatment of newborns with MMC is presented, concentrating on the question of selection for treatment. Second, a thorough analysis is made of the criteria used for life termination. Third, a case of a newborn with a very severe MMC is presented as a ‘reference case’.

Conclusion
‘Unbearable and hopeless suffering’ cannot be applied to newborns with MMC. They are not ‘terminally ill’ and do have ‘prospects of a future’. In these end-of-life decisions, ‘quality of life judgments’ should not be applied. When such a newborn is not treated, modern palliative care always will suffice in eliminating possible discomfort. There is no reason whatsoever for active life-termination of these newborns.

]. He found that only 7% of the survivors had less than “crippling disability”, “most had a quality of life inconsistent with self-respect, learning capacity, happiness, and even marriage”. To “spare children and families prolonged suffering” he proposed the well-known ‘Lorber selection criteria’. These four major adverse criteria are: severe paraplegia, gross enlargement of the head, severe kyphosis or scoliosis and associated gross congenital anomalies (such as heart disease) or major birth injuries. No active treatment was advised for children who had one or any combination of these criteria. The result of this proposed selection was to treat only those with lesions on lumbar and sacral level without any other major complication. Others would, according to Lorber, “die quickly”.

Over the last 30 years, continual progress has not only been made in the neurosurgical (closure of the back defect, shunting, or endoscopic techniques for the complicating hydrocephalus, treatment of tethered spinal cord and Chiari II malformation), orthopedic (treatment of scoliosis, correction of club feet), urological (preserving normal renal function, securing social continence), and psychosocial treatment of patients with MMC, but also in support for independence by modern rehabilitation programs.

What is considered ethical at one time, or in one country, can be considered unethical or unacceptable at/in another. The ethical debate on treating children with MMC is unique in the sense that these children will/can have a life of substantial and sometimes severe physical disability but often with normal mentation, this in contrast to severely psycho-motor handicapped children. Children and adults with MMC can be aware of their deficits.

Is the advice not to treat, or to terminate the life of the newborn deliberately (involuntary euthanasia) an ethically defendable one?

]. Because these judgments are questioned, and to quantify the level of discomfort in these neonates, the “Rotterdam Prospective Study on Discomfort in Newborns with Spina Bifida” was started in 2005 in the Erasmus Medical Center (EMC)–Sophia Children’s Hospital (Rotterdam, the Netherlands). Although in due time the results of this study will be published, some important aspects will already be addressed in this paper by elaborating on the case of a newborn with a very severe form of MMC and hydrocephalus.

], and he further referred to the Dutch Association of Paediatrics who developed criteria, including the lack of capacity to communicate, lack of capacity for self-maintenance, persistent need for medical assistance, and the existence of pain. All these criteria grouped together gave a picture of the baby’s quality of life. Because most of the criteria were satisfied, the baby was considered to be severely handicapped, resulting in a very poor expected quality of life; the child was not operated on because of the severity of the expected handicaps.

]. All parents consented to the proposal of termination of life; in four cases, they explicitly requested for it. For the public prosecutor, the termination of life was acceptable if four requirements were properly fulfilled: (1) the presence of hopeless and unbearable suffering, (2) consent of the parents to termination of life, (3) consultation of another physician or of a multidisciplinary MMC team, and (4) a proper and careful execution of the termination. These four criteria eventually became the cornerstone of the so-called ‘Groningen Protocol’, a protocol meant to insure that the decision for life termination, the executing itself, together with reporting to the legal authorities, are all conducted in a proper way. This protocol was approved and adopted by the Dutch Association of Paediatrics in 2005.

]. In their article ‘Why the Groningen Protocol should be rejected’, Chervenak et al. (2006) concluded that: “The justification they offer is woefully inadequate. It relies on appeals to the concepts of “hopeless and unbearable suffering,” the “best interests of the patient,” and “medical-ethical values,” but it never explains these concepts, and it gives no ethical argument for their clinical application. In fact, not only is no argument for the Protocol given, none can hope to succeed. The Groningen Protocol should therefore be rejected as the basis for obstetric and neonatal practice in The Netherlands and throughout the world.” (11)

] In her opinion, in these end-of-life decisions ‘quality of life judgments’ should not be made and, in a way, with this letter she also highlights the inconsistencies in the reports by Verhagen et al. Being of crucial importance, the subject of ‘quality of life judgments’ will be discussed more extensively in paragraphs 4 and 5.
Finally, in 2006, in The Netherlands a national multidisciplinary expert review committee has been appointed. In the case of active termination of the life of a newborn, the responsible physician is supposed to inform this committee, which then has to determine whether the criteria for life termination have been met. Subsequently this committee has to advise the Public Persecutor’s Office (OM) whether the physician should be prosecuted or not. Although such a committee seems to guarantee more certainty, it can be doubted, however, if this ‘checking on afterhand’ is of much value for the newborn in question. It seems to be more sensible to change this procedure to a ‘checking on beforehand’. Legally, this might perhaps be difficult to establish, but it seems not justifiable that legal procedures themselves do dominate the question of appropriateness of life termination; errors in judgment being unacceptable (cf. the level of certainty required for a death penalty in crime in, e.g., the USA).

Besides these results, criteria such as ‘living independently’ or ‘doing things independently’ can be confusing when deciding about the future life of vital newborns. Most people who do live a meaningful life are dependent on others or interdependent on each other. In fact, interdependency and especially the willingness to care for other (perhaps dependent) people can be considered as a criterion of a truly civilized society, certainly so when this means to offer ‘something for nothing’ (this being real mercy).

] again cannot be substantiated: a retrospective survey of treated newborns with MMC over 2 years in the Sophia Children Hospital showed that three to four operations were needed in their first year of life.

‘Life expectation’ (‘the burden of severe suffering increases by a longer life span’)
It is clear that the longer a patient lives, the more medical care will be needed in a quantitative way. Whether this means that this will affect the experienced quality of life in a negative way remains totally unclear and cannot be predicted. Furthermore, patients with MMC do require relatively much of their medical care in their first two decades, this steadily decreasing when they grow older and when disabilities and coping with these disabilities are gradually stabilized.

Can ‘suffering’ be applied as a reasonable criterion in newborns?
Suffering, especially the ‘unbearable and hopeless’ aspects of it, is a complex psychosocial phenomenon and by definition strictly individualized: only the individual itself can experience the existence, the intensity, and hopelessness of it. Others (parents, physicians, nurses) can only to some degree make an estimation of it. It is therefore tentative whether ‘suffering’ can be applied to newborns at all. What is possible, however, is to establish quite precisely the level of ‘(dis)comfort’ of a newborn by making use of standardized score charts such as the Comfort score and the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) (see below).

To date, it is not clear why such incorrect information is presented to parents, colleagues, and society as a whole. When parents are told that communication with and of their child never will be possible, that their child will face a life of agonizing pain and will suffer unbearably, that this suffering cannot be alleviated by any means, that annually at least 60 operations will be needed to offer some (but only temporary) relief, then these parents are left without any hope and their consent/decision to non-treatment, or to active termination of life, almost can be predicted. However, in such situations the fundamental concept of ‘informed decisions’ is obviously violated.

Non-discrimination principle

]. Deliberate termination of the life of newborns with spina bifida is always preceded by a non-treatment decision (as in the baby Doe case and the baby Rianne case) and according to Dorscheidt, the decision of non-treatment should be questioned with regard to the non-discrimination principle as well. He elaborates on two fundamental rights of the child, being the child’s right to life and its right to health(care), mentioned in international human rights instruments such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, and the European Convention of Human Rights, and on the authoritative views of international human rights bodies such as the United Nations Children’s Rights Committee (UNCRC) and the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (CESCR).

People with spina bifida and hydrocephalus can live a full life with equal value to that of any other citizen and they should not be seen as a medical condition. Their views should be sought and heard by governments and health professionals, who should acknowledge the right of people with spina bifida and hydrocephalus to speak for themselves.

People with disabilities have the right to aim for lives as rewarding as those of their peers who have what is regarded as a normal life. Supportive systems must be in place when they are needed.

Experience over the past 30 years has improved considerably the medical outcome and the quality of life of people with spina bifida and hydrocephalus.

As a recognition of the importance of non-discrimination on the basis of disability (that is to say, present as well as expected disability) or (expected) quality of life in deciding whether or not a newborn child with, e.g., spina bifida should be treated or whether or not it is justified to deliberately terminate such a child’s life, Dorscheidt (2006) recommends to involve the legal concept of ‘objective justification’ in the medical-decision making process. By using a particular questionnaire, the physician in charge may take advantage of this concept when considering (and deliberating on) how to act properly and professionally. Through this, the physician can ensure the disabled newborn child’s rightful claim to equal protection of its right to life and its right to health(care). Doing so would offer possibilities to replace the usual doctor-centered approach of decision making by a more patient-centered approach as well.

]. This notion, however, is a misconception: they are not terminally ill because of the MMC and/or hydrocephalus per se; they are ‘terminally ill’ because of the decision not to treat their congenital malformations. The needs of these untreated newborns, however, are still the same as the needs of all newborns: proper care, feeding, comfort, respect and love; till death (and apparently not death itself). The ‘need’ for life termination in these patients can only be regarded as an indication of insufficient palliative care. Life termination as an act of mercy can only be applied to hopeless situations that can occur, e.g., on battlegrounds or in mountaineering, when there are no proper means indeed to alleviate real unbearable suffering. This is obviously not the case in a modern equipped hospital (at least, it should not be) with experience in palliative care and pain management.

]. This is followed by: “However, giving medication to relieve suffering in hopeless situations which may, as a side effect, accelerate death, can be justified”.
To date, it is not clear why these recommendations should not hold for cases of untreated spina bifida and hydrocephalus in the Netherlands and why the Dutch Association of Paediatrics does not adopt these recommendations.

, but now with the VAS (min = 0: no pain; max = 10: most severe pain) Note: The combination of a Comfort score of at least 17 and a VAS of at least 4 indicates that the well-being of the newborn is in jeopardy. In such a situation, the attending nurse is expected to determine the cause of the discomfort and to take adequate measures (changing a full nappy, feeding a hungry child, emptying a full bladder, giving adequate painkillers if appropriate, etc.) to secure the child’s well-being




When untreated (the first 3 days), the child was not discomfortable.

Closing of the back lesion, in this case certainly a major procedure, did not contribute significantly (and only temporarily) to more discomfort. In other words, closing of the open spine can be qualified as a proportional treatment modality.

The same holds true for placing a ventricular shunt.

Treating an active hydrocephalus adequately contributes to the well-being of the patient.

In 1 month’s time, this active treatment resulted in a stable situation of overall well-being in this patient.

Only paracetamol and low-dose morphine were necessary in the treatment of actual discomfort.

Synthesis and conclusion
There is no evidence that newborns with MMC and hydrocephalus do either ‘suffer’ unbearably or hopelessly and certainly not without the prospect to relieve this suffering by standard care. ‘Suffering’ itself is a nonconclusive, and in newborns, inapplicable denominator that should not be used anymore in this debate. Although they will in their future life be confronted with handicaps, sometimes very severe, their future prospects and their actual experienced quality of life cannot be predicted with such certainty at birth that their lives can be regarded as hopeless or meaningless (‘quality of life judgments’ as such being unacceptable in this decision making). Possible discomfort in these newborns can easily be treated in a straightforward way by active treatment (closure of the defect and shunting the hydrocephalus) and, when necessary, by the use of a professional pain/symptom protocol.
The decision not to treat such a newborn, when based on expected handicaps, possibly violates the ‘non-discrimination’ principle (Dorscheidt, 2006). When not being treated, they are not terminally ill because of the MMC and/or hydrocephalus per se; they are ‘terminally ill’ because of this nontreatment decision. Not being terminally ill, it is not ‘humane’ or ‘merciful’ to terminate their life, this also being not in accordance with international legislation and international medical recommendations.
When untreated and when it is the intention to alleviate actual discomfort (this question of intent being crucial to a moral and legal analysis of end-of-life decisions including active termination of life), this can always be achieved in an effective way by using one of the widely accepted palliative protocols. Such a child can and should be cared for in a respectful and dignified way, providing all its actual needs (which apparently is not death itself). This being the case, there is no indication whatsoever for the deliberate termination of the life of children born with MMC.
While Verhagen et al. (2005, 2006) must be credited for bringing the discussion about deliberate termination of newborns in the open, to date, there does not seem to be much in their qualifications that can be quantified properly, especially not in cases of MMC, which is prone to quality of life judgments (and thereby neglecting the needs and rights of the newborn). To date, the Groningen protocol, therefore, cannot be regarded as very useful. Being a tool, it seems to have been changed in a means in itself. To gain more usefulness, at least it has to be extended in a way as proposed by Dorscheidt (2006), by adding charts such as the Comfort Score and the VAS and by adding palliative medication charts. Thus, it should be changed from a doctor-centered protocol to a patient-centered protocol.
71
]
Finally, to date it remains unclear on what grounds the Dutch Association of Paediatrics has adopted the Groningen protocol and why international legislation, international human rights instruments, and international medical recommendations appear not to hold for the Netherlands, especially not in newborns with MMC.
