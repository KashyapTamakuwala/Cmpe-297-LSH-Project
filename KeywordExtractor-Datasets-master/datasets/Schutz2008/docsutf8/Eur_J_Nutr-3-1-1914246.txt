Background
In 2004, the European Court of Justice decided that the prohibition of fortification with vitamin A, vitamin D, folic acid, selenium, copper, and zinc in the Netherlands conflicts with the principle of free movement of goods in the European Union. This decision led to a change in the Dutch policy, resulting in a more flexible handling of requests for exemption from this prohibition to fortify. Therefore, an investigation was proposed in which it would be determined whether a general exemption could be granted for food fortification with a certain maximum safe amount per micronutrient.

Aim of the study
To develop a risk assessment model to estimate maximum safe fortification levels (MSFLs) of vitamins and minerals to foods on the Dutch market, and to evaluate these levels to derive allowed fortification levels (AFLs), which can be used for a general exemption.

Methods
We developed a risk assessment model to estimate MSFLs of vitamins and minerals to foods on the basis of existing models. We used European tolerable upper intake levels in combination with national food consumption data to estimate MSFLs for fortification of foods for several age groups. Upon extensive stakeholder dialogue, the risk manager considered these estimated MSFLs and the final AFLs for a general exemption were set.

Results
For folic acid, vitamin A, and vitamin D, the MSFLs were calculated in the risk-assessment model. Children up to 6-years old were the group most sensitive to folic acid fortification, and they had an MSFL of 0 µg/100 kcal, but following a risk management evaluation, this was upgraded to an AFL of 100 µg/100 kcal. The MSFL for vitamin D was 3.0 µg/100 kcal (children 4–10 years old), and the risk manager increased this to an AFL of 4.5 µg/100 kcal. Children up to 10 years old, men, and postmenopausal women were the groups most sensitive to vitamin A fortification (MSFL = 0 µg/100 kcal). Because these groups represent a large part of the population and because of the seriously harmful effects of excessive vitamin A, the risk manager did not allow a general exemption.

Conclusions
The combination of a risk assessment model and risk manager evaluation led to the setting of AFLs for general exemption of fortification with folic acid and vitamin D. This model is also applicable for other micronutrients, for which an UL is derived, and in other countries.

]. In view of the present application, the derivation of maximum safe fortification levels (MSFLs), these models on optimal intake were not taken into account. The question how to create an optimal micronutrient intake is outside the scope of this paper.
On the basis of the existing models to calculate a maximum fortification level, a model adapted to the Dutch practical situation was developed for the Dutch authorities to derive for the fortification with micronutrients. This article first describes the model for the derivation of maximum amounts of micronutrient fortification in the Netherlands, and then it illustrates the use of the micronutrient specific data and assumptions in the calculation of the MSFLs for folic acid, vitamin A, and vitamin D. The article concludes with the considerations and the final allowed fortification level (AFL) of the risk management.

Our model calculates the maximum safe level for fortification with a micronutrient per 100 kcal of the food (MSFL) for various age groups with the mathematical formula presented in Box 1. The lowest MSFL, i.e., the MSFL for the most sensitive group, is then advised to be the overall maximum acceptable fortification, as is common practice in toxicological risk assessment.

). For children and adolescents, the MSFL for folic acid fortification increased with age because of an increase in UL over the age groups. For adults, men generally had lower MSFLs than women due to a higher energy intake. Based on the most sensitive age group (i.e., children 1–6 years) the MSFL is 0 µg/100 kcal. For the most sensitive adult group (i.e., men 18–30 years old) the MSFL is 67–71 µg/100 kcal. Our calculated MSFL for the most sensitive group is lower for folic acid than the acceptable level of addition of Rasmussen et al., 23 µg/100 kcal for the most sensitive group (1–3 years old), while we calculated 0 µg/100 kcal for children 1–6 years old. This difference is mainly caused by a lower estimation of the SI by Rasmussen et al., which was based on Danish legislation. In our calculations, the current intakes from dietary supplements were estimated based on the amount of folic acid available in dietary supplements on the Dutch market.

Vitamin A

). Filling in these factors in the formula (Box 1) resulted in a MSFL for vitamin A of 0 µg vitamin A/100 kcal for children 1–10 years old, men and post-menopausal women, 154 µg vitamin A/100 kcal for women 19–30 years old and for older children and adolescents, the MSFL is 10–70 µg vitamin A/day. In conclusion, the MSFL for vitamin A will be 0 µg vitamin A/100 kcal on the basis of the most sensitive groups (i.e., children 1–10 years, men 18 years old or more, and postmenopausal women). Our results for vitamin A were the same as Rasmussen et al.’s, i.e., 0 µg vitamin A/100 kcal.

Risk-management: setting AFLs for general exemption
After the risk was assessed, a risk manager considered all the important issues and decided what maximum level of fortification will be allowed and included in a general exemption. In the Netherlands, proposed changes and additions to the Dutch Commodity Act are discussed with stakeholders (e.g., organizations of trade and industry, consumers organizations, authorities) in a Regular Consultation on the Commodity Act. Representatives of individual companies cannot participate in the Regular Consultation on the Commodity Act.

Folic acid

). For practical reasons, the risk manager rounded this value off to an AFL of 100 µg folic acid/100 kcal. Because of this relatively liberal AFL and the fact that the value was based on the MLF of adults, it was decided to monitor the intake of folic acid from fortified foods. If the results of the monitoring show that the long-term intake exceeds the UL in specific population groups, appropriate measures can be taken.

Vitamin D
28
n
n

). The risk manager adopted this MSFL and set the AFL at 4.5 µg/100 kcal. Again, the risk manager desires monitoring of vitamin D and energy intake for insight into current intakes and proportions of energy intake fortified. If long-term intakes exceed the ULs, appropriate measures can be taken.

Vitamin A
In contrast to the liberalization for folic acid and vitamin D, the risk manager did not liberalize the results from the risk assessments for vitamin A. To the opinion of the risk manager, exceeding the UL of vitamin A has more serious consequences for public health than exceeding the ULs for folic acid and vitamin D. In addition, the 95th percentile of habitual dietary vitamin A intake of several age groups already exceeded the UL, even without considering the vitamin A intake from dietary supplements. Furthermore, at this time no request for exemption has been received, although one product for which an exemption for folic acid was requested also contained vitamin A. So the AFL was set at 0 µg/100 kcal. The stakeholders in the consultation agreed with this decision.

Exception for low-energy products
An exception was made for light variants of products (low-energy products). According to the model, products low in energy may be fortified with smaller amounts of the micronutrient than the more energy-dense counterparts. In view of the obesity trend and the healthy image of light products, this was considered undesirable. Therefore, light products may be fortified with amounts similar to the amounts approved for their more energy-dense counterparts.

Risk management
The discussions about the risk-assessment results with the different stakeholders worked well for the risk manager. This resulted in broad insight into the various points of view of the stakeholders. Ultimately the risk manager took the final decision, and in all these cases the stakeholders agreed with the final outcome. The risk assessment was based on the precautionary principle. However, with a view to the fact that this will be a temporary policy, the outcome of the risk assessment was judged to be rather conservative for folic acid and vitamin D. In contrast, the market may change, the date the European legislation will come into effect can be later than expected, and people may consume more fortified foods than estimated. Therefore, monitoring the intake of micronutrients from fortified foods is a very important tool for warranting the safety of the population. If monitoring shows that some groups within the population have habitual intakes that exceed the ULs, adaptations should be made. Especially children may be vulnerable. A food consumption survey is currently being conducted among children in the Netherlands. These data will provide insight into the micronutrient intake from natural foods, fortified foods and dietary supplements during 2005/2006.

Additional considerations
Some factors that were not taken into account in MSFL risk assessment are worth considering, and they can be implemented in the model or taken into account in the risk management if necessary. First, we made an exception for the fortification level of ‘light’ products in our risk management. This exception was not considered in the calculation and can therefore theoretically lead to micronutrient intakes that are too large even if the energy intakes are not exceptionally high. Monitoring the use of fortified ‘light’ products will be necessary to avoid frequent users exceeding the UL. Second, some products are intended for a specific population or target group only. If there is little risk that the product will be used by nontarget groups, the risk manager can make an exception to the model. Instead of using the calculated MSFL for the most vulnerable group, the MSFL for the specific target group can be used as a maximum for this specific product. Again, monitoring of the use of these products is important, and mentioning the target groups, as well as nontarget groups, on the product package might be considered.
24
]. To be able to protect all consumers and avoid underestimation of the intake, this so-called overage should be integrated into the MSFL in the model. Rasmussen et al. also noted this problem. In Denmark the currently accepted practice is to add up to 150% of the declared amount. Our calculated MSFL includes overage.

International applicability of the risk-assessment model
11
]. The simultaneously setting of both the maximum levels for dietary supplements and for foodstuffs can result in a well based division of micronutrients over dietary supplements and fortified foods. Once the choice has been made which micronutrient is allowed to be added to dietary supplements and/or fortified foods, models like the one presented can be helpful to set the MSFL and AFL for micronutrients in food products.
The applicability of the model for this purpose depends on the availability of the input data. When calculating MSFLs valid for Europe as a whole, the availability of European data is necessary. However, data from a food consumption survey that cover all Member States of the European Union representatively are not available. Such data are not even available for all Member States individually. Furthermore, consumption data available in various Member States are often collected with different methods, in a different time frame, and for different specific population groups and the fraction of energy intake that can be fortified may differ greatly from country to country because of the various traditional diets. This makes it difficult to estimate the total habitual intake for each micronutrient and energy type at a European level.
To overcome these problems, MSFLs in Europe can be set by using the available country-specific calculations and to select the most sensitive country (i.e., the country with the lowest MSFL). The maximum safe level for fortification for this country can then be applied in all Member States.


Conclusion
As this paper illustrates, our model for risk assessment can be used in the Netherlands to help risk managers to set maximum levels for safe addition of vitamins to foods. This has resulted in two general exemptions, one for folic acid at 100 µg/100 kcal and one for vitamin D at 4.5 µg/100 kcal. The model is flexible and can be adapted to new insights. For example, aspects concerning overage and ‘light’ products can be included with minor changes in the formula. Monitoring of the total micronutrient intake after applying a general exemption, as well as monitoring of the fortified fraction of the energy intake and the effect of the exception for light products, is recommended for evaluating the model parameters and AFLs and for making adjustments when needed.
