MR imaging of bone marrow infiltration by hematologic malignancies provides non-invasive assays of bone marrow cellularity and vascularity to supplement the information provided by bone marrow biopsies. This article will review the MR imaging findings of bone marrow infiltration by hematologic malignancies with special focus on treatment effects. MR imaging findings of the bone marrow after radiation therapy and chemotherapy will be described. In addition, changes in bone marrow microcirculation and metabolism after anti-angiogenesis treatment will be reviewed. Finally, new specific imaging techniques for the depiction of regulatory events that control blood vessel growth and cell proliferation will be discussed. Future developments are directed to yield comprehensive information about bone marrow structure, function and microenvironment.

Introduction
Bone marrow is the fourth largest organ of the human body. Its main function is the hematopoiesis, i.e., it provides the body with erythrocytes, leukocytes and platelets in order to maintain the oxygenation, immune function and auto-restoration of the body.
MR imaging provides a non-invasive visualization of the bone marrow and may be used to define its cellular or fat content as well as its vascularity and metabolism. Treatment effects due to irradiation, chemotherapy or other new treatment regimens may change one or several of these components, thereby causing local or generalized changes in bone marrow signal intensity on MR images. This article will provide an overview over such treatment-related bone marrow signal changes on MR imaging. In order to recognize these treatment effects, one has to be familiar with the MR imaging features of the normal and non-treated pathologic marrow. Thus, this article will first provide a brief overview over MR imaging features of the normal and non-treated pathologic marrow as a basis for subsequent descriptions of the bone marrow after conservative or new treatments.

]. Another valuable contribution of MR is its capacity to detect soft-tissue paravertebral masses as well as epidural masses and neural foramen invasion, which may accompany vertebral disease. In case of clinical symptoms such as unexplained back pain or new neurological symptoms, MR is the modality of choice to detect paravertebral and epidural masses, which may accompany bone marrow infiltration of the spine.
14
].
In summary, dedicated MR imaging of the bone marrow in patients with hematologic malignancies is currently restricted to applications in patients with multiple myeloma, selected patients with other malignant lymphomas with a high risk of bone marrow infiltration and/or extracompartmental tumor growth as well as patients with potential treatment complications. Additional patients with hematologic malignancies may undergo MR imaging for evaluations of other pathologies, outside the bone marrow. And since the bone marrow is depicted on nearly any MR examination throughout the body, the knowledge of the normal and pathologic marrow of these patients before and after therapy is crucial for the radiologist in order to provide a comprehensive diagnosis. Such “secondary” evaluations of the bone marrow may outperform above mentioned primary indications in this patient population.

]. Of note, T2-weighted FSE sequences without fat saturation are probably the worst sequences for evaluation of the bone marrow since both lesions and normal fatty marrow appear hyperintense on these sequences.
19
]. All of these methods were used to measure the fat content or the water/fat fraction more accurately. However, these measurements have so far not demonstrated clinical significance, and hence these techniques are currently not used for routine imaging.
20
21
]. The technique relies on selective excitation of the water resonance and generation of image contrast that is dependent upon differential nuclear relaxation times and self-diffusion coefficients.
Contrast-agent enhanced scans
 In most instances, the administration of Gd-based contrast agents is not necessary for evaluation of bone marrow disorders. Administration of Gd-DTPA can be helpful to differentiate cysts and tumors, to differentiate necrotic and viable tumor tissue before a biopsy, in suspected osteomyelitis or in equivocal cases of bone infarcts. If Gd-DTPA-enhanced scans are performed, fat saturated T1-weighted sequences should be used in order to suppress the fatty components of the bone marrow with intrinsic high signal intensity and, thus, to provide an optimal depiction of the Gd-enhancement.

26
]. This may be one reason why it did not find wide clinical application to date.
27
27
]. On the other hand, since the transendothelial diffusion of MMCM is a rather slow process, it is usually sufficient to acquire MMCM-enhanced dynamic data with intervals of one to two minutes or, for specific questions, even to obtain just one delayed contrast enhanced scan. Applications of potential clinical interest will be mentioned in the specific sections below.

32
].
New developments for whole body MR imaging, such as parallel imaging techniques, dedicated coils (Angio-SURF), and the total imaging matrix (Siemens systems, Avanto) may provide a “screening” of the whole red bone marrow for tumor infiltration within a reasonable time.
33
34
]. PET-MR imaging has been described as superior, a least for some applications, compared to PET-CT because of the improved intrinsic soft tissue contrast and potential direct bone marrow depiction provided by MR.

Normal bone marrow
35
38
38
38
38
]. In adults, the signal intensity of the normal bone marrow is typically hyperintense to surrounding muscle and intervertebral disks on T1-weighted MR images and hypointense to surrounding muscle on STIR- or fat saturated T2-weighted MR images. The knowledge of this pattern of conversion is useful to differentiate normal cellular marrow from focal or diffuse neoplastic involvement and to recognize treatment effects and tumor recurrence.
26
25
]. Thus, each investigator should establish the specific threshold for normal bone marrow enhancement for the technique used at his particular MR scanner and institution.

Pathologic bone marrow in hematologic malignancies
Neoplastic infiltration of the bone marrow in MR images results in a replacement of the fatty converted marrow by neoplastic cells, thereby increasing the cellular content of the bone marrow, which results in a prolongation of T1- and T2-relaxation times and subsequent decreased T1-signal and increased T2-signal of the bone marrow. The detection of neoplastic bone marrow infiltrations with MR imaging depends on the quantity and distribution of cellular infiltration.
The distribution of neoplastic bone marrow involvement in patients with hematologic malignancies may be focal, multifocal or diffuse. In patients with NHL, a focal or multifocal involvement is more common than the diffuse infiltration pattern. In patients with myeloma, an additional, typical “salt and pepper” or variegated distribution may be observed, most frequently in stage I disease according to Salmon and Durie. In patients with leukemia, the bone marrow is usually involved in a diffuse fashion. A multifocal involvement may be seen in a small proportion of patients, particularly those with AML.
The detection of focal, multifocal and “salt and pepper” or variegated infiltrations of the bone marrow in patients with NHL is straight forward: The MR signal intensity of focal bone marrow lesions is typically iso- or hypointense to surrounding muscle and intervertebral disks on T1-weighted MR images and hyperintense to surrounding muscle on STIR- or fat saturated T2-weighted MR images. Since these focal lesions are also associated with an increased angiogenesis, they show an increased signal enhancement compared to the surrounding bone marrow on fat saturated T1-weighted MR images.

47
47
]. Irradiation of the spine may cause a scoliosis, which is typically concave to the irradiation field, if only one side of the spine was irradiated. In children, irradiation of the whole spine may also result in a scoliosis. There is usually an associated impairment of the growth of paraspinal muscles as well as an impaired vertical growth of the irradiated vertebrae. Depending on the applied dose, the bone marrow of the vertebrae may undergo a usually transient or (rarely) persistent fatty conversion and the bone marrow in the peripheral skeleton may show a compensatory hypercellularity.
47
]. In these patients, the bone marrow usually appears normal (in case of remission of the leukemia) on MR images.
47
]. This may be diagnosed early on MR images by an asymmetry and typical widening of the center or posteromedial region of the affected physis, which is best seen on plain T1-weighted MR images. A potential subsequent closure of the physis may be diagnosed by sequential MRI, it typically develops from the posterior portion anteriorly.

AVN is caused by vascular insufficiency, compromised bone marrow perfusion, and, finally, anoxia and death of bone marrow cells. Bones with end-arterial vascular supply and poor collaterals are particularly prone to develop an AVN, such as the femoral head, distal femur and proximal tibia, proximal humeri, tali, scaphoid, and lunate bones. Usually, the cartilage is not affected because it is nourished by synovial fluid.
52
].
53
]. This crescentic, ring-like well defined band of low signal intensity on T1-weighted images is thought to represent the reactive interface between the necrotic and reparative zones and typically extends to the subchondral plate. On T2-weighted images, this peripheral band classically appears hypointense with an adjacent hyperintense line - the “double line sign”. The hyperintense inner zone represents hyperemic granulation tissue, the hypointense outer zone represents adjacent sclerotic bone. Though characteristic of AVN, this sign is uncommon with the use of fast spin-echo sequences with or without fat suppression and is not necessary for diagnosis of the disease. There is no need to perform conventional T2-weighted sequences to find this sign. On STIR images, the band-like signal alterations of the bone marrow (corresponding to the “inner zone”) usually appear hyperintense.
54
53
54
].
There is currently no established role for Gd-administration in non-traumatic AVN.
Of note, in children, the proximal femur epiphyses may show a residual, small subcortical rim of hematopoietic marrow, which typically appears brighter than adjacent muscles on plain T1-weighted MR images. This should not be confused with the “double line sign” in early AVN, which is characterized by a subcortical rim, which is iso- or hypointense compared to surrounding muscle.
52
]. AVN that are entirely circumscribed, and that do not extend cranially to the cortical subchondral margin, have a good outcome, independent of the overall size of the AVN lesion. AVN that do extend to the subchondral margin and are associated with epiphyseal collapse are at risk to result in permanent disability.

58
]. With response to treatment, the tumor mass that had replaced the trabeculae, may resolve and the unsupported vertebrae can collapse. An increasing back pain in patients with myeloma after treatment may be caused by such vertebral compression fractures or tumor progression. Relapse and poor response to treatment are well evaluated with MR imaging. In patients with clinical relapse, new focal lesions, an increase in the size of previously identified focal lesions or a change from focal to diffuse infiltration may be seen. Additional signs of tumor progression are increasing paraosseous soft tissue masses or increased Gd-enhancement of focal lesions after chemotherapy. A progress of focal to diffuse bone marrow neoplasias may be sometimes more difficult to assess, since a diffuse bone marrow infiltration may be indistinguishable from reconverted hematopoietic marrow after e.g., GCSF-treatment. As specified above, a new Gd-enhancement of >40% or lack of USPIO uptake in a hypercellular marrow may indicate a tumor progress or recurrence in these cases.

]. However, though these techniques are clinically available for more than a decade, perfusion studies are used infrequently or not at all in clinical practice since the obtained functional changes in bone marrow vascularity do not or only slightly precede the obvious and readily apparent clinical parameters for treatment response.

Bone marrow reconversion after standard therapy
After successful cytotoxic therapy and/or irradiation, the normal bone marrow may undergo a reconversion from fatty to highly cellular hematopoietic marrow. This reconversion occurs in a reverse fashion compared to the conversion from hematopoietic marrow to fatty marrow, described above, i.e., the reconversion progresses from the central skeleton to the periphery. Within long bones, it involves first the metaphyses and then the diaphyses. The presence of cellular marrow within the epiphyses in an adult patient with hematologic malignancies is always suspicious for neoplastic infiltration, especially when the rest of the bone marrow did not undergo a complete reconversion. A reconversion of marrow within the epiphyses is only rarely seen, usually in conjunction with an extensive reconversion of the hematoietic marrow of the whole bone.

New therapy regimens
74
]. The anti-angiogenic therapy is intended to stop cancer progression by suppressing the tumor recruitment of new blood supply. As such, the anti-angiogenic drugs are generally tumorostatic, not cytotoxic. Thus, a successful therapeutic inhibition of angiogenesis can be expected to slow or stop tumor growth, but not to cause tumor regression or disappearance. Accordingly, MR imaging may show a persistent high bone marrow cellularity under anti-angiogenic treatment. Signs of a response to this treatment are rather a delayed, less steep and smaller bone marrow enhancement after intravenous administration of small molecular Gd-chelates compared to pretreatment studies.
75
76
]. Future studies have to show, if these results can be also obtained in patients and if so, they would be obviously of high clinical significance for treatment monitoring and management.
76
77
78
79
]. This possible synergy between these anti-angiogenesis drugs and cytotoxic drugs or irradiation, as a function of apparent tumor microvascular hyperpermeability, can also be interrogated with MMCM-enhanced MR imaging.

Stem cell transplantation
The most commonly used therapy for patients with lymphoma is autologous stem cell transplantation. For this, the patient receives a conditioning therapy, then his or her own stem cells are collected by leukapheresis, the patient subsequently receives a high-dose chemotherapy or irradiation and his previously collected stem cells are reinfused. With some types of lymphoma, an autologous transplant may not be possible in case of persistent malignant bone marrow infiltration. Even after purging (treatment of the stem cells in the lab to kill or remove lymphoma cells), reinfusion of some lymphoma cells with the stem cell transplant is possible. It would, therefore, be of high clinical significance to be able to differentiate patients with still viable lymphoma cells in their bone marrow at the time of leukapheresis from patients in true complete remission.
In refractory diseases or in aplastic anemia, allogenic marrow transplantation or chord cell transplantation are also used. This much more aggressive procedure is initiated by a conditioning high dose chemotherapy and/or total body irradiation and subsequent reinfusion of allogenic donor cells, i.e., stem cells from a matched sibling or unrelated donor. Allogenic transplantation has limited applications, because of the need for a matched donor. Another drawback is that side effects of this treatment are too severe for most people over 55 years old. After the conditioning therapy for allogenic marrow transplantation, the patients reach complete aplasia, are usually isolated on a bone marrow transplantation unit and should only undergo MR imaging for vital indications.
80
].
17
81
80
]. One reason for this difference in observation may be the limitation of the MR imaging technique to detect and differentiate viable and non-viable tumor cells. Some patients with a “clean” bone marrow may have residual microscopic active tumor cells while macroscopic residual lesions on MR imaging in other patients may or may not be viable. In our opinion, it would be highly significant to investigate MR imaging criteria (e.g., diffusion weighted MR, dynamic MR, new contrast agents, spectroscopy) for the differentiation of such persistent focal bone marrow lesions that may or may not develop to recurrent disease after stem cell transplantation.

). Long-term complications of TBI, applied as part of the conditioning regimen for a bone marrow transplantation, are the development of osteochondromas or sarcomas.
In summary
, MR imaging can be a useful tool to aid in the treatment monitoring of patients with hematologic malignancies by monitoring treatment response, detecting treatment complications, differentiating normal and neoplastic hypercellular marrow and by diagnosing residual or recurrent tumor deposits. In order to achieve clinical significance and cost-effectiveness, the MR imaging technique should be clearly tailored to specific patients and the specific questions described in detail above. New MR imaging techniques may serve to depict those molecular pathways and regulatory events that control blood vessel growth and proliferation. Non-invasive monitoring of anti-angiogenic therapies has found success by defining tumor microvascular and metabolic changes, while treatment-related changes in bone marrow morphology tend to occur rather late and are non-specific. Already established in many institutions, future developments will almost certainly include “fusion” or “hybrid” imaging methods, such as PET-CT and PET-MR in the treatment monitoring of patients with malignant lymphomas.
