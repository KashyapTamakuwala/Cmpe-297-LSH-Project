Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome is characterized by severe growth and mental retardation, microcephaly, seizures and ‘Greek helmet’ facies, caused by partial deletion of the short arm of chromosome 4. Growth charts are given from 0–4 years of age, based on the study of 101 individuals. Use of these specific growth charts is recommended, because standard growth charts are inapplicable for patients with WHS.

Materials and methods
The study is based on data from 1,057 examinations of 101 children with WHS, 35 males and 66 females, born between 1975 and 2002. Data from 32 children were collected from records of individuals with WHS in the Netherlands. Another set of data was obtained from 69 children with WHS from Great Britain, North America, Germany and Australia who were contacted through WHS support groups. There were no exclusion criteria except growth hormone treatment. Thus, all children regardless of complicating disease such as heart defects, renal disease or feeding problems, were included. The number of observations in the Dutch group of children was higher than in the group of children from other countries. No difference in parameters related to growth was observed between Dutch and non-Dutch patients. The data used for creation of the growth charts were age at examination, height (cm), weight (kg) and head circumference (cm). The growth charts cover the time period from birth until 4 years of age.

]. As there are no growth charts for children with WHS elsewhere in the world, no comparison could be made with growth charts from children with WHS from other countries.
Data for weight and height were transformed into logarithms before statiscal analysis in order to obtain normal distributions. All growth charts are based on means and standard deviations. The software used was SPSS version 10 and Sigmaplot version 8.02 bij SPSS Inc.

]. Closure defects, hypotonia, gastro-eosphageal reflux, epilepsia, repeated infections and surgical procedures all can have a significant influence on growth. Not all patients with WHS have the same deletion size. Until now there has been no evidence of an influence of the deletion size on growth, but all studies have only involved small numbers of children. Deletion size can be expected to be of influence on growth, and therefore we tried not to include patients with a known microdeletion. However, this study inevitably includes patients with different deletion sizes, but the number of included children was too small to show an effect on growth. Based on the available data from the Dutch cohort, we could not identify a major co-morbidity risk factor aggravating growth retardation. Almost all children with WHS showed a marked intra-uterine growth retardation. Despite adequate feeding none of the children with WHS, demonstrated catch-up growth; all remained short with a profound microcephaly. The developed specific growth charts should be used for children with WHS from birth to 4 years of age for the estimation of their growth and health condition as standard growth charts are inapplicable in these patients. At present the authors are constructing growth charts for older children with WHS.
