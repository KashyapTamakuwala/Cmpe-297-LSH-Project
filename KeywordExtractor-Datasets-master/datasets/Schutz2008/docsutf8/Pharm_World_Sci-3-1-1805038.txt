Objective:
There are many drug–drug interactions (D–DI) of which some may cause severe adverse patient outcomes. Dispensing interacting drug combinations should be avoided when the risks are higher than the benefits. The objective of this study was to identify determinants of dispensing undesirable interacting drug combinations by community pharmacies in the Netherlands.

Methods:
A total of 256 Dutch community pharmacies were selected, based on the dispensing of 11 undesirable interacting drug combinations between January 1st, 2001 and October 31st, 2002. These pharmacies were sent a questionnaire by the Inspectorate for Health Care (IHC) concerning their process and structure characteristics.

Main outcome measure:
The number of times the 11 undesirable interacting drug combinations were dispensed.

Results:
Two hundred and forty-six questionnaires (response rate 96.1%) were completed. Dispensing determinants were only found for the D–DI between macrolide antibiotics and digoxin but not for the other 10 D–DIs. Pharmacies using different medication surveillance systems differed in the dispensing of this interacting drug combination, and pharmacies, which were part of a health care centre dispensed this interacting drug combination more often.

Conclusion:
Medication surveillance in Dutch community pharmacies seems to be effective. Although for most D–DIs no determinants were found, process and structure characteristics may have consequences for the dispensing of undesirable interacting drug combinations.

Only in cases that the risks associated with the D–DI are higher than the benefits or if a better alternative is available, the D–DI should be avoided.

 < 0.01). In the multivariate analysis, models were composed using the analysis set, predicting the dispensing of the interacting drug combinations. The models were validated using the validation set. The number of questions was too large for the multivariate analysis, and only a limited number of questions were selected. From every chapter, those questions were selected that correlated with the other questions and that could discriminate between pharmacies.


Results

. Disopyramide (D–DI number 6) and azapropazon (D–DI number 11) were not dispensed by 44% and 46% of the pharmacies, respectively. Therefore, a ratio could not be calculated for these pharmacies and these D–DIs were excluded from the analyses.

. Two hundred and sixty-eight pharmacies were selected to receive a questionnaire and 74 pharmacies were selected for a visit by the IHC. For several reasons, such as recent visitations and duplications in the database, 12 pharmacies were excluded. Eventually, 256 pharmacies received a questionnaire and 62 pharmacies were selected for a visit. Two hundred and forty-six questionnaires were filled in (response rate 96.1%) and 58 (93.5%) pharmacies were visited after the questionnaire was completed. The judgements during the visits by the IHC were compared with the answers by the pharmacists. In 33 of the 37 verified questions, the IHCs judgement matched in more than 90% the answer of the pharmacist. Except four questions, the judgement by the IHC was equally more positive and more negative than the answers by the pharmacist.

Discussion
In this study, we investigated determinants for the dispensing of 11 undesirable interacting drug combinations. In general, our results are in line with the expectation that the medication surveillance system plays an important role in medication surveillance. Although the 11 potential D–DIs were counted 11,594 times which suggests that a considerable number of patients is exposed to potential and avoidable adverse patient outcomes, these results should be judged against a background of approximately 100 million dispensings. It is possible that in these cases due to particular circumstances any other option, such as substituting or not dispensing one of the drugs, is a less favourable choice than dispensing the D–DI. In 5% of the total number of D–DIs more than one pharmacy was involved, indicating the importance of communication. For the D–DI between macrolide antibiotics and digoxin, two determinants were found. Although the type of medication surveillance system was a determinant, this does not mean that the differences are determined by the quality of the system itself because they may also correlate with the attitude of the pharmacists using the systems. The three medications surveillance systems differ in the extent to which communication with other healthcare providers is possible and developments were made in recent years. The Pharmacom system has the most advanced communication possibilities and compared to the other systems, new developments to the Euroned system were modest. Unexpectedly, pharmacies part of a health care centre dispensed this D–DI more often than other pharmacies. In health care centres, the communication lines between pharmacists and general practitioners are much shorter, suggesting that intervening undesirable D–DIs will be easier. Possibly, pharmacies which are part of a health care centre oppose the opinions from the general practitioners less often, to avoid harming the cooperation within the health care centre but, of course, there may be several other reasons.
For the other eight assessed D–DIs no determinants were found in the univariate analysis, neither did the models in the multivariate analysis have a good predictability. A possible explanation is that the quality of medication surveillance in community pharmacies in the Netherlands is high. Therefore, the number of pharmacies dispensing high-risk D–DIs seems to be small.
p
 < 0.01) correlation in two independent sets. Although we included 183 questions and nine D–DIs in the univariate analysis, the possibility of including a significant correlation by chance was small (on average 0.16 question). Second, the reimbursement data from eight health care insurance companies were used. In the Netherlands, these companies work mostly regionally. It is nevertheless not to be expected that the determinants of dispensing interacting drugs differ per region or that pharmacies differ in their management of D–DIs between patients of different health care insurance companies. Third, from all potential D–DIs, only 11 (but highly clinically relevant ones) were selected for this study. According to the Dutch guidelines, for all 11 combinations the dispensing of an alternative was strongly advised as a good alternative was available. Nevertheless, it is possible that these dispensings were not an error because any other option was not possible. For example, when a patient is hypersensitive to the alternative drug recommended in the guidelines or when the alternative drug is not effective. In these cases, the benefit of both drug therapies should be weighed against the potential risks of the D–DI. The potential risks can partly be avoided by taking appropriate measures such as monitoring of drug levels. In this study, we could not retrieve why the pharmacist had dispensed the interacting drug combination, and whether the dispensing was erroneous or not.
Fourth, the questionnaire was composed on the basis of a literature search and interviews with experts. It is possible that not all characteristics correlating with the dispensing of undesirable interacting drug combinations were disclosed, such as differences in population characteristics between pharmacies. For example, pharmacies with an elderly population using more drugs simultaneously have a higher risk of dispensing interacting drug combinations than pharmacies with a younger population. Also, it is possible that in areas with many general practitioners who use a medication surveillance system for prescribing, the background chance of a D–DI is much smaller. Fifth, it is possible that the differences between pharmacies were too small compared with the power of this study to distinguish determinants.
All associations found in this study were directly related to the management of signals. In our questionnaire, we also included other topics, such as pharmacy preparations and patient care. Future research should focus on the management of a larger variety of signals than the ones in our study and on how D–DI associated dispensing could be further reduced.

Conclusion
In conclusion, both medication surveillance systems and being part of a health care centre may play an important role in the management of D–DIs and the avoidance of adverse patient outcomes. Pharmacies in a healthcare centre dispensed D–DIs more often. For most D–DIs, no determinants were found possibly indicating that the quality of medication surveillance in the Netherlands is high.
