Abstract
Drosophila
 mitosis. We found that the Aurora B kinase complex is essential for this phosphorylation at centromeres, while Polo kinase is required to down-regulate H2A phosphorylation on chromosome arms in mitosis. Cyclin B degradation triggers loss of centromeric H2A phosphorylation at anaphase onset. Epistasis analysis indicated that Polo functions upstream of the H2A kinase NHK-1 but parallel to Aurora B. Therefore, multiple mitotic kinases work together to specify the spatial and temporal pattern of H2A T119 phosphorylation.

 mitosis. The Aurora B complex is required for this phosphorylation in centromeric regions, while Polo kinase suppresses phosphorylation by NHK-1 on chromosome arms. Inactivation of Cdc2 kinase is required for loss of centromeric phosphorylation at the metaphase-anaphase transition. Therefore, these mitotic kinases together control the temporal and spatial pattern of H2A phosphorylation at centromeres.

) was co-transfected with ubiquitin-GAL4 to induce expression. Transfected cells were identified by the presence of GFP. The presence of dH2A-pT119 on centromeres of segregated chromosomes (> 50 cells) was scored.
Cultured cells were examined using a Plan-Apochromat objective lense (100×, 1.4NA; Zeiss) attached to an Axioplan2 (Zeiss). Images were captured by a CCD camera (Orca; Hamamatsu) using OpenLab2 (Improvision). Larval central nervous systems were taken using a Plan-Apochromat lense (63×, 1.4NA; Zeiss) attached to an Axiovert 200 M (Zeiss) with a confocal scan head (LSM510meta; Zeiss). Confocal images were presented as a maximum intensity projection of the Z-stacks. All digital images were imported to Photoshop (Adobe) and adjusted for brightness and contrast.

-nitrophenylphosphate) and incubating on ice for 10 min. Lambda phosphatase (NEB) was added to the cell extract without phosphatase inhibitors and both samples incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. 2× SDS sample buffer was then added to the extracts and boiled for 3 min. Samples were then western blotted with anti-dH2A-pT119 to compare phospho-protein levels. In addition, cells immediately resuspended in 1× SDS sample buffer were included for comparison.
For phosphatase treatment of fixed cells for immunofluorescence with the anti-dH2A-pT119 antibody, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS followed by incubation with lambda phosphatase for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were then washed and immunostained as described above. Microscope images with the same exposure settings were taken of immunostained cells with and without phosphatase treatment. Average pixel intensity of dH2A-pT119 staining on the DNA was measured in interphase and mitotic cells (16 cells in 2 separate experiments).

). Interphase phosphorylation was not affected in any of the cases. These results indicated that the large AuroraB complex is required for centromeric phosphorylation of H2A at T119 in mitosis.

Polo kinase down-regulates the H2A phosphorylation on chromosome arms
[20]

B). This result suggests that Polo kinase is directly or indirectly required for down-regulating H2A T119 phosphorylation on chromosome arms to enrich the phosphorylation at centromeric regions.

Polo suppresses phosphorylation by the H2A kinase NHK-1

). This indicated that H2A T119 phosphorylation on chromosome arms induced by loss of Polo kinase was independent of Aurora B activity.

). Quantitative analysis confirmed that the phospho-H2A signal on chromosome arms in Polo NHK-1 double depletions was decreased to a level comparable to that of the control or NHK-1 depletion.

These epistasis studies suggested that Polo functions upstream of NHK-1 to suppress H2A T119 phosphorylation, but is independent of Aurora B.

Cyclin B degradation triggers a loss of H2A phosphorylation at initiation of anaphase
[21]
[22,23,13]
Figs. 4
A, B). Therefore, we concluded that cyclin B degradation, not anaphase onset, is required for triggering loss of phosphorylation at the metaphase-anaphase transition.


Discussion
Drosophila
Fig. 4
C). Aurora B kinase is required for the enrichment of phosphorylation at centromeric regions in mitosis. Polo kinase is required for suppressing H2A phosphorylation by NHK-1 on chromosome arms. Furthermore, inactivation of Cdc2 kinase induced by Cyclin B degradation is required for the loss of centromeric phosphorylation at the onset of anaphase.
Currently we do not know what the function of this H2A phosphorylation is in cells. In higher eukaryotes which have many copies of histone genes, the function of histone modifications has been studied only indirectly by down-regulating responsible modifying enzymes. Unfortunately this approach is not suitable for kinases as they are likely to have multiple substrates (for example, Cdc2 and Aurora B mediating H1 and H3 phosphorylation).
[19,20]
. It would be a future challenge to define the precise roles of this H2A phosphorylation.

Dynamic change of H2A T119 phosphorylation in the cell cycle. S2 cells were immunostained with anti-dH2A-pT119 antibody. H2A T119 phosphorylation was over all chromatin in interphase (A) but enriched to centromeric regions in prophase (B) and maintained through prometaphase (C) and metaphase (E). The phosphorylation was lost in anaphase (F). The boxed region in C is magnified in D. Scale bar = 10 μm.

 < 0.001). (C) A schematic diagram for regulation of H2A phosphorylation at T119 in mitosis. In interphase, phosphorylation is found throughout the chromatin. In early mitosis, the phosphorylation is enriched at centromeric regions. This process is mediated by the concerted action of Aurora B and Polo kinases which are required for H2A T119 phosphorylation at centromeric regions and suppressing the phosphorylation on arms, respectively. At the onset of anaphase, the phosphorylation at centromeric regions is lost. Cyclin B degradation or Cdc2 inactivation is required for the loss.
