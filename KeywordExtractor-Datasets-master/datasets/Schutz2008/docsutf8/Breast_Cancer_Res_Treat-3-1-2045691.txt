Introduction
The main purpose of this study was to determine whether the optic cups of tamoxifen users and anastrozole users differ in size, with the cups of the tamoxifen users being smaller.

Methods
Optic nerve head (ONH) topography was measured using a commercially available, confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscope for three populations of amenorrheic women ages 40–69 years: subjects using (1) tamoxifen (20 mg/day) or (2) anastrozole (1 mg/day) for ≤ 2 years as adjuvant therapy after successful primary treatment for breast cancer, and (3) control subjects with no breast cancer histories and not using any hormonal medication. All subjects had excellent visual acuity and healthy eyes, based on conventional photographic assessment.

Results
The cup volumes of the tamoxifen users were shown to be significantly smaller than the cup volumes of the anastrozole users, which were indistinguishable from normal. Because the cup volumes of the tamoxifen users decreased markedly with age at about 50 years and because anastrozole is indicated only for post-menopausal women, comparisons were reassessed for subjects older than 50 years. For these subjects, the cup volumes of the tamoxifen users averaged less than half of the volumes for each of the other two subject groups, and significant between-group differences existed in both the lateral (cup area) and axial (cup depth) directions. In contrast, any between-group differences at the ONH margin were small and not significant.

Conclusions
The results of this study suggest that the ONH be assessed biomorphometrically for tamoxifen users reporting visual change that cannot be attributed to non-tamoxifen causes. The ability of modern intraocular imaging techniques to reveal anatomic change on the order of tens of microns may be useful for assessing tamoxifen-induced effects occurring simultaneously elsewhere in the brain, particularly since the presence of small cups is consistent with the possibility of tamoxifen-induced astrocytic swelling.

]. Because the use of aromatase inhibitors is likely to continue to increase and because the use of tamoxifen may become progressively more restricted to younger women, the potential side effects of anastrozole need to be evaluated, and the influence of age on tamoxifen side-effects needs to be closely examined.

]. If tamoxifen indeed causes optic-cup swelling via its ability to block swelling-activated chloride channels, the cup sizes of anastrozole users would be expected to more closely resemble those of female control subjects than those of tamoxifen users. The present study tested this prediction.
Because of changing trends in adjuvant breast cancer treatment, the present study also assessed the effect of age on optic nerve head (ONH) parameters. The results support the inference that tamoxifen usage can lead to small cups, although apparently mainly for women older than about 50 years. All measurements for this study were obtained using confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy with the Heidelberg Retina Tomograph II (HRT). This commercial instrument was introduced in 1999 for routine clinical use, but until now, it has been used mainly to assess glaucoma and related conditions.

All tamoxifen and anastrozole users had completed primary treatment for breast cancer, and all were fully active and able to perform their daily pre-cancer activities without restriction. None of the control subjects had positive breast cancer histories or had previously used breast cancer medication for any purpose. Similarly, none of the tamoxifen users had previously used a hormonally acting breast cancer medication other than tamoxifen, and none of the anastrozole users had previously used a hormonally acting breast cancer medication other than anastrozole. In addition, none of the subjects in any group had ever used the SERM raloxifene.
With one exception, all analyses for this report are based on data from subjects who had been amenorrheic for at least 6 months at the time of testing. The one exception is an analysis comparing data from control subjects with data from an additional group of women (the fourth subject group overall) who met the same eligibility criteria as the control group, except for the absence of menses.

]. These criteria are: (1) 20/20 or better visual acuity in one eye and 20/25 or better visual acuity in the other eye, (2) no evidence or suspicion of eye disease on undilated direct ophthalmoscopic examination and on subsequent evaluation of individuals’ stereoscopic color fundus and ONH photographs by a glaucoma specialist (author JRS) who was masked from identifying subject information, (3) no history of eye disease or ocular hypertension, (4) no diabetes, (5) intraocular pressure (IOP) ≤22 mmHg on Goldmann applanation and no between-eye IOP difference >2 mm Hg, (6) no myopia >5 diopters, (7) no use of any medication (other than tamoxifen) known to affect vision, (8) no history of ocular surgery, and (9) normal color vision (i.e., no worse than a single minor transposition error on the D-15 test conducted under Macbeth illumination). There was no suggestion of papilledema for any subject (as for criterion #2).

]. All subjects were Caucasian, except for one Asian subject still experiencing menses. After being informed of the nature and possible consequences of the study, all subjects gave written informed consent to participate in this study. The study protocol adhered to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the OHSU Institutional Review Board and the OHSU Cancer Institute. For each subject, HRT data and IOP measurements were obtained at the same testing session. Subject recruitment and assessment lasted several years, until usable HRT data had been collected for 20 eligible anastrozole users.

], which is often most discernable from the underside of the 3D image, as a ridge circumscribing the ONH. With these 3D-based contour lines, the mean measured disk areas for each of our subject groups were very nearly centered within the norms provided by Heidelberg Engineering on the HRT II printout. Thus, with one exception, all analyses of HRT values are based on the contour lines drawn according to the more recent set of criteria, which are intended to place the contour line exactly at the disk margin, rather than slightly within it. The one exception was made to assess the importance (or lack of importance) of the precise contour line placement for documenting between-group differences. Thus, we conclude the Results section by briefly reporting the results of analyses based on data obtained using the earlier contour-line placement criteria.

]. Image quality was equally good for each subject group. The mean average-topographic-standard-deviation for each of the three amenorrheic subject groups ranged from 20 to 22 (SD = 7–8) μm for all eligible subjects and also for subjects older than 50 years. Among women still experiencing menses, the mean was 23 (SD = 9) μm.

) remained significant. In addition, the duration of medication use was observed to matter little or not at all for the anastrozole users. For instance, the regression line relating cup volume to the duration of anastrozole use accounted for only 5% of the total cup-volume variance among all 20 anastrozole users, and for only 4% when the calculation was restricted to the 18 anastrozole users older than 50 years. These several sets of results indicate that the cup differences between the tamoxifen and anastrozole groups did not occur because the anastrozole users had experienced too short a period of medication use.

), every corresponding comparison became significant when based on the smaller contours. In particular, the cup-area values for the older tamoxifen users (>50 years) became significantly lower than the cup-area values for the older control subjects (>50 years), presumably because using the smaller contours enhanced the importance of effects occurring predominantly within the interior of the cup.

], and they allow high-resolution biomorphometric data to be collected in ways that are non-invasive and not intimidating to patients. The ease of data collection with these devices may allow patients who report tamoxifen-related vision change to be evaluated before and after cessation of tamoxifen use, and also after any rechallenge. Until this is done, and then only if changes in vision are shown to correspond to anatomical changes, might it be justified for the type of results described in this study to direct therapy. Presently, the only assured clinical application is to alert ophthalmologists and neurologists that assessment of the ONH for conditions such as glaucoma or optic neuritis may be complicated by the use of tamoxifen.

Based on photographic assessment of the ONH and retina by a neuro-ophthalmologist (author JF), there did not appear to be any difference in the vasculature of the three subject groups that would have led to the between-group cup differences quantified in this study and also observed in the ONH photographs when examined for groups of subjects rather than for isolated subjects.

]). Hormonal reduction by itself, whether occurring naturally or induced by anastrozole, does not appear to result in cup-size reductions of nearly the magnitude or the frequency inferred for the older tamoxifen users, at least not for the age range that we investigated. The presence of small cups among the tamoxifen users probably did not result from selectively low IOP levels, since the measured IOPs for each subject group were quite similar, differing by no more than 0.2 mmHg on average. Because the presence of small cups among tamoxifen users appeared to be unaccompanied by corresponding significant effects at the disk margin, the effects of tamoxifen on the ONH may be regarded as predominantly localized to the cup.
