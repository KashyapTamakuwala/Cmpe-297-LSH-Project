). These receptors belong to a large polymorphic and polygenic subset of the Ig superfamily with members located on at least three independently segregating loci. Like mammalian and avian innate immune regulatory receptors, IpLITRs have both putative inhibitory and stimulatory forms, with multiple types coexpressed in various lymphoid tissues and clonal leukocyte cell lines. IpLITRs have an unusual and novel relationship to mammalian and avian innate immune receptors: the membrane distal Ig domains of an individual IpLITR are related to fragment crystallizable receptors (FcRs) and FcR-like proteins, whereas the membrane proximal Ig domains are related to several leukocyte receptor complex encoded receptors. This unique composition of Ig domains within individual receptors supports the hypothesis that functionally and genomically distinct immune receptor families found in tetrapods may have evolved from such ancestral genes by duplication and recombination events. Furthermore, the discovery of a large heterogeneous family of immunoregulatory receptors in teleosts, reminiscent of amphibian, avian, and mammalian Ig-like receptors, suggests that complex innate immune receptor networks have been conserved during vertebrate evolution.

Herein is described a novel set of IgSF receptors present in the channel catfish, and possibly other teleosts, that are composed of Ig domains related to functionally diverse immunoreceptor families present in mammals. Detailed sequence analysis supports that individual catfish leukocyte immune-type receptors (IpLITRs) contain a unique composition of Ig C2-like domains sharing homology with both FcRs and receptors encoded within the LRC. Thus, IpLITRs provide further evidence supporting the common evolutionary origins of genomically and functionally distinct immunoregulatory receptor families present in mammals.

Discussion
The novel IpLITRs described herein represent a polymorphic and polygenic gene complex that are primarily expressed in hematopoietic tissues. The polymorphic nature of this gene complex was indicated by RFLP analysis, which revealed differences in where various restriction enzymes cut the genomic DNA among the sibling catfish. However, it should be noted that only detailed sequence analyses of these IpLITR genes in a number of individuals would be required to determine if any polymorphic differences are also found within the coding regions. In addition, segregation analyses suggested that IpLITR genes are encoded within multiple independently segregating but homologous loci, similar to the situation seen with the ZfLITR homologs identified by genome mining. These paralagous relationships strongly suggest that IpLITRs are products of multiple gene duplication and translocation events from a common ancestoral gene. Whether or not the receptors encoded by the different IpLITR loci are functionally redundant remains to be determined. However, IpLITRs are related to functionally and genomically distinct mammalian FcRs and LRC encoded receptors, suggesting that such paralogous loci could have evolved to give rise to an array of immunoregulatory receptors with different functions.
The coordinate expression of IpLITRs by myeloid and lymphoid cell lines in combination with their potential activating and inhibitory signaling capabilities suggests that they play an important role in immune cell function(s). This possible importance of IpLITRs in immune responses is highlighted by the RT-PCR expression studies where a large number of highly related, but unique, IpLITR sequences were identified. These variant IpLITR sequences differed in the number of Ig domains present, and in some cases in the length of the CYT. Therefore, in addition to the prototype IpLITR1, IpLITR2, and IpLITR3 described here, other IpLITR family members are coexpressed by catfish myeloid and lymphoid cells. Whether or not some of the variously sized transcripts represent messages from different IpLITR genes or are the result of alternative splicing is unknown. However, the large number of unique IpLITRs found expressed suggests that IpLITRs represent a complex immune receptor family that can potentially generate a large number of IpLITR types.
The prototypical IpLITR1, IpLITR2, and IpLITR3 encode receptors with four, three, and six Ig domains, respectively. Pairwise comparisons and phylogenetic analysis of these domains suggest a high degree of conservation and a conserved membrane distal to membrane proximal ordering. Each of these three receptors has very similar D1 and D2 sequences, and IpLITR1 and IpLITR3 have almost identical D3 and D4s. However, variation does occur between predicted membrane proximal Ig domains. The IpLITR2 D3 sequence is unique to this receptor and IpLITR3 D5 and D6 are not similar to any other of the prototypical IpLITR Ig domain sequences. Identification of LITR-like sequences on different zebrafish chromosomes and comparisons with IpLITRs supports the notion that these polymorphic and polygenic immune receptors are not unique to catfish. Like IpLITRs, the predicted ZfLITRs are also composed of unique combinations of Ig domains. Such differences in the Ig domain compositions of IpLITRs and ZfLITRs may influence their ligand binding capabilities, formation of homo- or heterodimers and overall immunomodulatory functions.

). Hence, it seems likely that IpLITR2 and IpLITR3 would each associate with such molecules and function in a similar manner as mammalian receptors with charged TM segments. Thus, the paired expression pattern of IpLITRs with activatory and inhibitory signaling potential is very similar to that shown for several mammalian and avian families of immune receptors, including PIRs, LILRs, KIRs, FcRs, and CHIRs.

). In contrast to the D1 and D2 domains, IpLITR1 and IpLITR3 D3 and D4 Ig domains are related to several members of the LRC (human chromosome 19q13.4). As above, these two domains clustered with one family of receptors (the LRC) and not the other (i.e., FcR/FcRLs). The identification of NKp46 as a structural relative from the PDB also supports this notion. Interestingly, D5 and D6 of IpLITR3 are related to FcR and FCRLs, but their membrane proximal location suggests that they are unlikely to be involved in ligand recognition (i.e., Ig). Finally, the third domain of IpLITR2 clustered with the Ig domains of several representative CHIRs. Taken together, IpLITR extracellular domain sequences appear reminiscent of both FcR/FCRLs and members of the mammalian and avian LRC, implying that catfish LITRs are distant relatives to each of these genomically and functionally diverse receptor gene families. At present, the functional significance of these novel teleost immune receptors is unknown.

). Taken together, these findings suggest that immune receptors encoded by human chromosome 1q21 and 19q13 most likely evolved from a common ancestor that has since undergone multiple rounds of duplication and homologous recombination events.

), raising the possibility that related immunoregulatory receptors in other species (i.e., CHIRs and IpLITRs) could also be involved in MHC recognition.
In summary, the discovery of individual catfish receptors that encode Ig domains related to both FcR and LRC gene families provides further support for the common origin of these important mammalian immune receptors. Identification of LITR-like sequences in the zebrafish genome also demonstrates that these receptors are likely found in all teleosts. Annotation of these genomic segments will be necessary to determine if zebrafish LITR homologs exhibit conserved genomic features and syntenic genomic location with mammalian 1q21-23 and/or 19q13. Thus, the discovery of IpLITRs is an important step towards further understanding the common origin and evolutionary history of the different families of mammalian immunoregulatory receptors. The investigation of the functional significance of these novel teleost receptors is underway and will be aided by the availability of channel catfish cell lines that coordinately express IpLITRs and the eventual production of IpLITR specific antibodies.
