Abstract
AIRE
In vitro
 phosphorylation assays show that the residues Thr68 and Ser156 are DNA-PK phosphorylation sites in AIRE. In addition, we demonstrate that DNA-PKcs is expressed in AIRE positive mTEC cell population and that introduction of mutations into the AIRE phosphorylation sites decrease the capacity of AIRE to activate transcription from reporter promoters. In conclusion, our results suggest that phosphorylation of the AIRE protein at Thr68 and Ser156 by DNA-PK influences AIRE transactivation ability and might have impact on other aspects of the functional regulation of the AIRE protein.

In agreement with the previous experiments, a reduction of about 30% in the phosphorylation levels of the T68A and S156A mutants was detected, whereas the APECED patient mutation V80L did not negatively affect the AIRE phosphorylation level. Thus, we conclude that amino acids Thr68 and Ser156 of the AIRE protein are the phosphorylation sites of DNA-PK.

 phosphorylation studies also indicate that other kinases may phosphorylate the AIRE protein, and that phosphorylation sites other than Thr68 and Ser156 should exist within AIRE.

. As shown in this study, conversion of Thr68 and Ser156 amino acids to alanines suppresses AIRE transactivation activity. However, we did not observe any influence of these mutations to AIRE dimerization and cellular localization (data not shown). Thus, since the mutations that do not impact AIRE dimerization and the dot formation ability can downregulate AIRE transactivation activity, the N-terminal part of AIRE appears to be involved in transcriptional regulation not only via its dimerization activity. It is possible that status of AIRE phosphorylation at N-terminus influences AIRE interactions with other protein partners or with DNA.
[45,46]
[47]
. We also studied whether UV irradiation changes AIRE cellular localization and expression level in various cell cultures but we could not detect remarkable differences (data not shown). Thus, it seems that DNA-PK phosphorylates AIRE independently of its function in DNA repair.

Fig. 1
AIRE PHD1 interacts with Ku70, Ku 80 and DNA-PKcs. (A) Coomassie staining of purified GST-AIRE-PHD1 and GST, indicated by arrows. (B) Affinity purification of AIRE-PHD1 binding proteins from THP-1 nuclear extract. Three protein bands that specifically bound PHD1 and that were analyzed by MALDI-TOF are indicated by arrows. Input represents 5% of the amount of nuclear extract used in pull-down.



Fig. 2
DNA-PK co-immunoprecipitates AIRE from cell lysates. (A, B) Whole-cell extracts were prepared either from AIRE or control transfected HEK293 cells, and used in co-immunoprecipitations as indicated. Antibodies that were applied in co-immunoprecipitations are indicated above. 1% of AIRE transfected whole-cell extract was loaded to control the expression of AIRE. Western blot was carried out with anti-AIRE (A) or anti-DNA-PKc (B) antibodies, positions of AIRE, cross-reacting IgG bands (A) and DNA-PK (B) are indicated left. Asterisk designates a nonspecific band occurring with anti-HA control antibody (B). (C) DNA-PK can interact with AIRE independently of DNA and RNA. For co-immunoprecipitations, either AIRE or control transfected HEK293 cells were used. Ethidium bromide (EtBr), micrococcal nuclease (MNase) and RnaseA/T mix treatment was performed where specified. Co-immunoprecipitations were carried out with anti-DNA-PK and anti-myc antibodies as indicated. Western blot was performed with anti-AIRE antibody, positions of AIRE and cross-reacting IgG bands are indicated left.

The values (±standard errors) are means of two independent experiments, except for control where only single experiment was carried out. (B, C, D) Phosphorylation of GST-AIRE (AIRE). Kinase reactions were carried out using nuclear extracts prepared from HEK293 (B) or DNA-PKcs positive MO59K and negative MO59J cell-lines (C), or by purified DNA-PK. GST-p53 (p53) was used as a positive control, DNA-PK inhibitor LY294002 (Ly) was included if indicated (B, D). Phosphorylation levels are presented in relative values compared to phosphorylation level of GST (=1), the values (±standard errors) are means of at least two independent experiments.

The kinase reactions were carried out using nuclear extracts prepared from HEK293 (B) or DNA-PKcs positive MO59K and negative MO59J cell lines (C). Phosphorylation levels are presented in relative values compared to phosphorylation level of GST (=1), the values (±standard errors) are means of at least two independent experiments.

Amino acids Thr68 and Ser156 of AIRE are phosphorylated by DNA-PK. (A) Prediction of AIRE phosphorylation sites with Scansite 2.0 and NetPhos 2.0 programs. Score estimates importance of the prediction (from 0 to 1) whereas higher score indicates the higher confidence of the prediction. Sequence shows the context of the acceptor residue in bold ± 6–7 residues. (B, C) Influence of T68A and S156A mutations to AIRE phosphorylation efficiency. The kinase reactions were performed either by nuclear extracts prepared from HEK293, DNA-PKcs positive MO59K or negative MO59J cell-lines (B), or by purified DNA-PK (C). Phosphorylation levels are presented in relative values compared to phosphorylation level of GST (=1). The values (±standard errors) are means of at least two independent experiments (B, C). The GST-AIRE protein containing patient mutation V80L was used as a control (C).

DNA-PK is expressed in mTEC cells. Thymuses were enzyme digested and FACS-sorted according to the expression of EpCAM and analyzed for the mRNA expression level of involucrin (INV), loricrin (LOR), DNA-PKcs and AIRE, using the quantitative RT-PCR. The relative expression levels are compared to involucrin level in cTEC cell population (=1), the values (±standard errors) are mean of two independent quantitative RT-PCR reactions both performed as triplicate measurements.



Fig. 7
T68A and S156A mutations influence AIRE transactivation activity. (A) The HEK293 cells were transfected with pSI (control), pSI-AIRE (AIRE), pSI-AIRE-T68A (T68A), pSI-AIRE-S156A (S156A) and either INV-pBL (INV) or LOR-pBL (LOR) reporter promoters. Activations are presented in relative values compared to luciferase activity of the control (=1). The values are means (±standard errors) of two independent transfections. (B) The HEK293 cells were transfected with pSI (control), pSI-AIRE (AIRE), pSI-AIRE-T68A (T68A), pSI-AIRE-S156A (S156A) and analyzed by Western blotting with anti-AIRE antibody.
