Abstract
The resazurin assay utilising microtitre-plate, described by Drummond and Waigh in 2000, has been modified to achieve more accuracy in the determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of natural products, including crude extracts, chromatographic fractions or purified compounds against various bacterial strains. This modified resazurin method is simple, sensitive, rapid, robust and reliable, and could be used successfully to assess antibacterial properties of natural products.

 seemed useful. This was because this method uses an indicator, resazurin, which allows the detection of microbial growth in extremely small volumes of solution in microtitre plates without the use of a spectrophotometer. However, it was soon realised that this published method incorporated changes in the concentration of both the test material as well as the bacterial suspension. Thus, although there is a serial dilution of the test materials, this method results in a decrease in the bacterial concentration serially, and as a consequence cannot be a ‘true’ indicator of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) which is supposed to be assessed in this assay. Moreover, in a number of other antibacterial assays, the bacterial concentration is only approximate as they are compared to the Macfarland standard. This approach is subjective and results are often not reproducible in two different laboratories. To overcome these drawbacks, we have modified the resazurin assay, especially the dilution protocols, and utilised a standard concentration of bacterial suspension so that a ‘true’ MIC value can be obtained. By challenging the test materials with a standardised inoculum, reproducible and meaningful results can be obtained. We now present a detailed description of the modified resazurin method, which is simple, sensitive, rapid, robust and reliable, and could be used successfully to assess antibacterial properties of natural products.

Preparation of resazurin solution
The resazurin solution was prepared by dissolving a 270 mg tablet in 40 mL of sterile distilled water. A vortex mixer was used to ensure that it was a well-dissolved and homogenous solution.

Concluding remarks

, and enabled results to be comparable for the test material for different bacterial strains. The method described here is easy to follow and accurate. The generation of an accurate MIC value, which can be compared to existing antibiotics, empowers the scientist with the knowledge to decide whether the extracts and compounds are worth pursuing further in terms of their antimicrobial potential.
