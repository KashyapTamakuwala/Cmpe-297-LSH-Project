Logistic regression analysis showed that a combination of the four polymorphisms, −809G>A, −616G>C, −291C>T and the 12-bp repeat, conferred a susceptibility to schizophrenia. These results suggest that the upstream variants have a primary functional effect in the etiology of schizophrenia in the Japanese population.

, it may be important to test for a synergistic interaction between genetic variants in addition to performing single SNP analysis. Haplotype analysis is a reasonable strategy, assuming that the causative allele arises from a specific ancestral haplotype. However, this method is inadequate when there is an accumulation of multiple causative variants in a restricted genomic stretch. Additionally, haplotypic analysis is further compromised in regions where LD is decayed, because of the low statistical power to detect association due to inflated degrees of freedom. Therefore, clusters of potentially functional variants in genomic region with tenuous LD are better analyzed using a logistic regression framework that provides a powerful test of SNP etiology.
DRD4
, by first re-sequencing the region to identify all genomic variants. We then tested the association of all identified/validated common variants individually, as well as performing synergistic interaction analyses between them and schizophrenia.

Materials and methods
Subjects
Samples from 570 unrelated cases of schizophrenia (285 men, 285 women; mean age 47.0±11.4 years), and 570 age and sex matched controls (285 men, 285 women; mean age 46.7±11.1 years) were analyzed. The diagnosis of schizophrenia was made by consultation according to DSM-IV criteria with consensus from at least two experienced psychiatrists. All available medical records were taken into consideration. Control subjects were recruited from hospital staff and volunteers who showed no evidence of present or past psychoses during brief interviews with psychiatrists. All subjects were from central Japan. The study was approved by the Ethics Committees of RIKEN, Hamamatsu University and Chiba University. All participants provided written informed consent.

Sequence analysis
DRD4
 gene (from 1,216 bp upstream of “A” in the start codon to 293 bp downstream of this “A”) was analyzed by the direct sequencing of PCR amplification from the genomic DNA of 30 unrelated Japanese schizophrenics. Primer sequences and detailed information on the reaction conditions are available upon request. Sequencing was performed using the DYEnamic ET terminator cycle sequencing kit (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, N.J., USA) and the ABI PRISM 3730 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif., USA). Polymorphisms were detected by the SEQUENCHER program (Gene Codes Corporation, Ann Arbor, Mich., USA).

, respectively. Re-sequencing was performed on the upstream region (from 1.2 kb upstream of the initiation codon to the 3′ end of exon 1)





Statistical analyses
The allelic and genotypic distributions were tested for association by Fisher’s exact test for biallelic markers (SNPs, the 120-bp tandem duplication and the 12-bp repeat polymorphism).

Discussion
DRD4
 gene, we focused on the upstream region, where associations with psychiatric phenotypes have been previously reported. However, genetic variants in this region do not show consistent association with schizophrenia. This may have been due to insufficient statistical power or inadequate interrogation of genomic variations in some studies. In addition, the differences in marker sets between studies increase the ambiguity when interpreting data. To minimize these problems, we adopted the thorough approach of re-sequencing and genotyping all validated polymorphisms.

 gene. It will be interesting to determine whether this multi-marker association can be confirmed in independent data sets, where samples are well-defined in terms of clinical variables such as symptoms, age-at-onset, severity, medication type, and response to antipsychotic treatment. Furthermore, it will be important to examine the functional effects of variant combinations, to understand the mechanisms by which they increase or decrease susceptibility to schizophrenia.
