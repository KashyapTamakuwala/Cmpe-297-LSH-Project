Recent medical informatics and sociological literature has painted the image of a new type of patient—one that is reflexive and informed, with highly specified information needs and perceptions, as well as highly developed skills and tactics for acquiring information. Patients have been re-named “reflexive consumers.” At the same time, literature about the questionable reliability of web-based information has suggested the need to create both user tools that have pre-selected information and special guidelines for individuals to use to check the individual characteristics of the information they encounter. In this article, we examine suggestions that individuals must be assisted in developing skills for “reflexive consumerism” and what these particular skills should be. Using two types of data (discursive data from websites and promotional items, and supplementary data from interviews and ethnographic observations carried out with those working to sustain these initiatives), we examine how users are directly addressed and discussed. We argue that these initiatives prescribe skills and practices that extend beyond finding and assessing information on the internet and demonstrate that they include ideals of consumerism and citizenship.

], but, this literature suggests, must be constructed in the process of being led to pre-selected information by health professionals and information specialists. In suggesting the need to create user tools that have pre-selected information, as well as guidelines for patients to use to check the individual characteristics (author, sources, date, underlying financial sponsorship, etc.) of the information they encounter, authors emphasize the boundary between lay and expert assessments of information, privileging the latter over the former. Existing literature prescribes that patients utilize government-provided medical/health portals, click on hyperlinked icons (seals of approval or “trust marks”) provided by non-profit or non-governmental organizations, follow checklists created by professionals or health educators, and/or download special toolbars, all of which will assist them in finding and evaluating information on the web.

 In order to develop skills for finding and assessing information on the internet, patients must engage in certain practices—practices that also enable developing the skills necessary to share the responsibility for information reliability and to be an empowered health consumer and responsible citizen.

They, too, saw that documents convey a vision of a refocused health care system to serve a population that has enough information resources to enable individuals to manage their own care and participating more actively in the health care process. Information, they argue, is transformed into something that is easily captured, understood and transformed to achieve wider goals—goals related to social responsibility and community values.

]. More communicative and cooperative modes of re-centering allow for bottom up articulation, without relinquishing everything to citizen preferences. Again, these programs are not just about the empowerment of individuals or about the distribution of expertise, but are also about distinguishing between active and inactive citizens. Although states demonstrate a readiness to engage in active teamwork and argue the need for collaborative solutions, Bang argues that they nonetheless reveal how key relationships are re-imagined and redrawn.

]. The lines that are redrawn serve only to reinforce what is already there. Second, the exclusive focus on states tends to neglect the role of other political actors. Especially in activities regarding reliable medical information, states are not alone, but are joined by non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and inter-governmental organizations (IGOs), as well as non-profit organizations voicing their own political advocacy agendas.

These self-ascribed roles lead to numerous questions, such as why UN NGO status (in the case of HON) or a “neutral position” (claimed by the WHO) is crucial to building claims about the reliability of medical information. Why is a ‘.gov’ domain “more reliable” than a ‘.com’ and where does the ‘.org’ domain rank in relation to other existing and proposed domains? What potential tensions arise between states and citizens (or even NGOs and citizens) in these settings? Although these questions would be difficult to answer, they do give us cause to think about the political messages that are sent to lay information seekers when they are instructed on how to search for, evaluate and use web-based medical information.

] assertion that consumers deserve both high quality content and a certain degree of confidence in the information they use, but such use also connotes certain responsibilities. Each of the initiatives to which the usage of these terms is attached defines particular types of participation that extend beyond gathering information to include activities in the health care process and social community at large. The consequence, of course, is that teaching patients how to search for and assess information on the web becomes more than just a process of constructing empowered patients—it extends further to inscribe notions of good consumerism and responsible citizenship.

How the Initiatives Enroll Citizens and Consumers

].
Highlighting Risks and Providing Simple Instructions for Combating Them
One evident strategy for interesting patients in the need to check the reliability of the information is the construction of web-based information as information that puts individuals at risk. Because of the nature of the web, information can come from anyone, anywhere—it originates outside of a given country, in another medical tradition or health care context and as such it is foreign and worthy of suspicion. If information isn’t pre-approved, individuals could be making their decisions based on wrong information, fraud, or quackery. An individual’s health is potentially endangered because this information is always potentially just one mouse-click away and is difficult to distinguish from “truly reliable” information. In the language of this discourse, boundaries are constructed around information—these boundaries distinguish, for example, between geographic locations, but also reinforce more traditional ideas by distinguishing between lay persons and experts.

The user that all of these organizations presuppose is someone who, like the project reviewers, is (or should be) familiar with the ethical issues underlying the provision of any, but especially medical, information on the web. We begin to see how political actors invent new modes of indirect steering for empowering users such that they choose specific paths. They attribute to these users skills and practices more in keeping with professional levels of information assessment and action. But they also make these practices “user friendly” by emphasizing the ease with which information can be checked, with little additional thought or demands on time, and by encouraging participation in partnerships with them.

Directing Paths Toward Information
The various initiatives also emphasize their links to the medical community and partnerships with one another. This is evident in at least three forms: logos from other departments and organizations placed on websites, joint projects with physician’s organizations and overt statements about the best course of action that are located on websites. At the time of writing, HON’s website includes the logos of the University Hospital, the EU, the city of Geneva and Sun Microsystems. The tag lines for each individual logo identify how these different groups provide social and technical support for HON and its web activities. These logos show that HON is part of a larger national and international community that transcends medical practice, politics and businesses—and suggest that evaluating medical information on the web can only be done in this context.

 and will not enable the user to find what s/he is looking for. Reliability is redefined as an issue of what is “relevant” and proper behavior involves not wasting time sifting through information and other materials that are, according to HON de facto irrelevant. Furthermore, in emphasizing that HON and the US gateway are the best types of sites, HON privileges state (implicitly working with medical) actors over other types of actors providing medical information on the web. The suggestion, then, is that engaging in good searching practices and finding/using the “right” information means prioritizing government and medical channels.

Website providers enable access to information that is consolidated and repackaged in a uniform format for readability and then placed on the respective site under a uniform design and structure for ease of navigation. Once again finding and using good information is made “easy” in the design of technology-specific tools.

 provides “Trusted health information for you.” Access to information gives users new choices, but these initiatives convey that responsible consumerism and reflexive use of information mean choosing narrow routes to prepackaged information. The internet offers numerous avenues to information, but “good” participation means utilizing choice to choose the routes provided by one’s own government and combining these with overarching non-governmental organizations or other non-profit organizations.

Individualizing Choice Along the Way

 and set their own preferences for characteristics that they find important in the provision of health information




The confidence rating and other information provided by the tool are only available for sites already in the HON or MedCIRCLE databases. While these types of tools suggest the importance of individual choice, they nonetheless hold individuals responsible for following the ‘right’ paths to information. In this sense, the discussion is not merely an issue of creating reflexive consumers, but also of judging non-reflexivity as irresponsible and deviant.

Following the Path Back to the State
The responsibility for finding good information and avoiding the risks associated with bad information on the internet becomes collaborative and distributed. Within this context, individuals are held responsible for the choices they make, how they engage with available information and how they engage with other actors in the collaborative process. This process involves new actors, such as HON and MedCERTAIN/MedCIRCLE, but also longer standing actors, such as the WHO, state governments and medical associations. Reliability is created through distributing skills, information, and practices, and is intertwined with the creation of new networks that bind together the technical and social. We see this in especially in uses of internet-based technologies to further public health education.

The links that are selected for inclusion in the newsletters link largely to other parts of the Department of Health and Human Services and to other health-related government institutions (.gov domain endings), such as the National Institutes of Health (of which NLM is also a part) or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
As these examples show, different actors have developed practices that place various elements in new and unique relationships with one another. Issues related to health become intertwined with, for example, federal holidays. The health practices of the individual are now inextricably linked with diverse forms of community participation. In this sense, health education and enrollment is no longer only or primarily about verifying online health information, but rather about diverse activities that extend beyond the online realm.

Directly Linking Health Practices and Citizenship
These initiatives are tools to help people find and/or check information and about helping lay persons become empowered, not merely through distribution of information, but also through coaching or education in how to participate more actively in the search for and use of information. Users are invited to join specific, defined communities that will, in one way or the other, protect them from misinformation and inform them about better ways to act. HON even emphasizes the strength and necessity of its partnership with lay users in able do what it sets out to do—HON cannot help lay users if the lay users do not help HON.
Additionally, there is a normative message about responsible citizenship. HON, for example, responds to individuals who follow their instructions and report (suspected) misuse of the HONcode icon by thanking them for their “sense of civic duty” and healthfinder’s newsletters make the initiative much more than just a gateway, or portal, to links of organizations with information. They also serve a promotional function to keep visitors returning to the healthfinder website and getting them to link through to other government sites. Further still, they show that being an active consumer and responsible citizen involves more than merely checking the information one encounters on sites or reporting misinformation and/or misuse of seals through certain channels. The responsibility extends into all areas of daily life (from good nutrition to awareness about possible diseases) and extends beyond individuals to include not only family or friends, but also the community-based or social responsibility that accompanies participation in educative programs, activism, or fund-raising events.

]. Herein lie strains of the tensions that are suggested by both Rose and Blume and Singleton: initiatives are created and promoted under the guise of increasing choice and democratization, but the actual prescriptions that they carry entail more powerful suggestions about which choices (both online and off) are the “right” or “better” choices—with alternatives to those choices being (explicitly or implicitly) discouraged.


Discussion
42
43
] argues, access to the internet is access not just to a tool, but to a place (emergent in for example, how the interface is designed or the level of engagement in a given activity) and a way of being (dependent on the degree to which the individual integrates the technology into his or her understanding of social construction). As providers or enablers of technology use, political actors at various levels (primarily states, but also NGOs and IGOs that provide different types of sites and tools) provide points of entry and create avenues not just to online information, but to online and offline social communities with specific rules for behaviour. This has implications for how technology is configured within the relationship between individuals and the state and other political actors. Especially important is that it highlights how the emphasis on claims of “neutrality” within the reliability debate is misplaced. Organizations such as HON or WHO, who claim their neutrality based on their international scope and/or their position outside of national governments, nonetheless carry specific normative ideas of acceptable politically or socially related user behavior. Likewise, individual state governments that claim to represent the needs of their own “general public” impose values on the information that they recommend to that public – for example, in privileging a .gov above all else, followed by a “.org” or “.edu” and reducing as much as possible endorsement of a “.com.”
30
]. However, in the examples provided above, we see that partnership does not necessarily imply equal footing for each of the three types of actors. Organizations use the catch-word reliability as a rhetorical device to capture attention and enroll users—redirecting their information-seeking behaviors, but also emphasizing deeper-rooted values that situate individual health-related practices within a greater context of idealized citizenship. As such, in addition to prescriptions for use of specific tools, we find underlying prescriptions for practices that reflect good citizenship.
online
offline
 community activities (activism, education, and fund-raising).
This participation also forms a reciprocal relationship between the participant and the given organization—in return for making oneself available to the community, the burden to search for, find, and evaluate information is made easier. Searching can be done using tools within which information has been pre-selected and/or information can even be sent directly to the individual’s personal e-mail. Both of these technical options for acquiring information also carry an implicit social promise of being taken care of—protection from misinformation or mis-action due to lack of information. The readiness to participate in this partnership—the commitment of the organization to helping protect its user community is made explicit.
17
 These collectives further counteract notions of individualization and separation from the community, as well as arguments that certain actors can be rendered irrelevant. Existing relationships become re-conceived as new alliances between medical and political actors, where internet technologies can be used to strengthen existing public education activities. Additionally, new (types of) communities emerge: families and friends or geographically concentrated communities are supplemented by communities that share aspects of visiting the same web sites and participating in the same self-policing chains—online and offline, individuals participate in communities by watching out for one another and sharing in the same activities.
Although these initiatives claim to target “all users, everywhere,” they actually idealize use such that discussions about increased choice (and how this leads to patient empowerment) also carry the normative implications that “true” empowerment is only possible when the “right” choices are made. Within these discussions, individuals have the responsibility to develop skills that make them informed consumers, and the process of acquiring these skills also enables them to contribute their part to the greater civic communities in which they engage. The additional implications connoted by the terms “citizen” and “consumer” raise the question of whether these really are more suitable as replacements for the word “patient” than other suggested alternatives.

Conclusion
Whereas discussions of technologies and their users have largely neglected to consider the role of states (and other political actors), discussions of the relations of states and individuals have not always considered the important reciprocal effects of and on changing technologies. Discussions of skill manage to link individuals to individual technologies, but they have not successfully coupled this back on the role of states. This paper has used the discussion about the reliability of web-based information to attempt to bridge these gaps and demonstrate the integral relationship between technologies and users, states and individuals, and individuals and the development of skills. It shows that political actors, including both governmental and non-governmental organizations, make presumptions about citizen willingness to use certain technologies and, as such, utilize soft power to encourage these citizens-as-users-of-technologies to forward certain agendas.

]. The power in question is generally interpreted as that of medical professionals, but this is not necessarily the only interpretation, as political actors clearly use this for their own means and ends, as well.
