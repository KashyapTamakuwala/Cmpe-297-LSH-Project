Background

].
Experience has shown that treatment selection for patients with psoriasis vulgaris is more commonly based on traditional concepts than on evidence-based data on the efficacy of various therapeutic options. In addition, it appears that systemic therapies are occasionally not applied in situations where they are needed due to the increased effort involved in monitoring the patients for unwanted side effects and possible interactions with other drugs.

Goal of the Guidelines

Physicians’ personal experiences and traditional therapeutic concepts should be supplemented and, if necessary, replaced by an evidence-based assessment of the efficacy of individual therapies in psoriasis vulgaris.

The guidelines provide in-depth explanations of the available systemic and topical treatments for psoriasis, including the different photo- and photochemical therapies, and provide detailed descriptions of the administration and safety aspects.

By providing background information on the profile of the available drugs, including efficacy, safety, and aspects of practicality and costs, the Guidelines should facilitate the process of selecting an appropriate treatment for each individual patient. This should help increase compliance and optimize the benefit/risk ratio of psoriasis therapies.

Basis of data




Evidence assessment

The efficacy and effectiveness of each intervention was evaluated using evidence-based criteria.

 evidence. In addition, the results of the different studies included in the meta-analysis must be consistent with one another.


2

A high-quality (e.g. sample-size calculation, flow chart, intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis, sufficient size) randomized, double-blind comparative clinical study.


B
Randomized clinical study of lesser quality or other comparative study (non-randomized, cohort, or case-control study).


C
Non-comparative study.


D
Expert opinion.

 evidence whose results are predominantly consistent with one another.

 evidence or studies with grade B evidence whose results are predominantly consistent with one another.

Intervention is supported by studies with grade B evidence or studies with grade C evidence whose results are predominantly consistent with one another.

Little or no systematic empirical evidence





Therapeutic recommendation

A distinct rating of the therapeutic options or a strict clinical algorithm cannot be defined for the treatment of psoriasis vulgaris. The criteria for selecting a particular therapy are complex. The decision for a specific treatment should be based on the profile of the available drugs and the characteristics of a given patient. The decision for or against a therapy remains a case-by-case decision. These Guidelines provide a reasonable form of assistance in deciding on a suitable therapy and are an instrument for optimizing the required therapeutic process.

The strength of the recommendation reflects both a treatment’s efficacy and the level of evidence supporting it as well as aspects of safety, practicality, and the cost/benefit ratio. A consensus on the strength of the recommendation was reached during the Consensus Conference.


Results

Therapeutic options are named and discussed in alphabetical order.

Evaluation of topical and systemic therapies in tabular form

These tables are intended to provide a rough orientation for evaluating the therapeutic options. Cumulative calculations of the individual aspects for the overall evaluation of the therapeutic options are not possible and cannot be drawn upon for the final analysis of a therapeutic option. The product assessment for each individual patient may deviate greatly. A direct comparison between systemic and topical therapies is not possible because of the different severity of the psoriasis lesions of patients treated with topical or systemic treatments. The evaluations reported here were made on the basis of data extracted from the literature and expert opinions.

The evidence level applies only to the estimate of efficacy.
Safety/tolerance in induction therapy or maintenance therapy 
This refers to the risk of occurrence of severe adverse drug reactions or the probability of adverse drug reactions that would result in the discontinuation of therapy.
Practicality (Patient)
 This evaluation analyzes the effort involved in handling and administrating the treatment regimen by the patient.
Practicality (Physician)
 This aspect considers the amount of work (documentation, explanation, monitoring), personnel and equipment needs, time for physician/patient interaction, remuneration of therapeutic measures, invoicing difficulties/risk of recourse claims from the health insurance companies.
Cost/benefit 
Consideration of the costs of an induction therapy or a maintenance therapy.
The evaluations of safety/tolerance in induction therapy or maintenance therapy as well as practicality for the physician or patient and the cost/benefit were performed using a scale ranging from poor (–) to good (++++). The gradation between these two extremes was made based on expert opinion and unsystematic literature search. A level of evidence was not given for these evaluations since no systematic literature review was performed.

Notes on the use of the Guidelines
The presentation of the therapies deliberately focused on those aspects deemed particularly relevant by a panel of experts. Aspects which are not of specific importance for a certain intervention, but which are part of the physician’s general obligations to the patient, such as the investigation of intolerance and allergies toward certain drugs or the exclusion of contraindications, are not individually listed, but it is nevertheless taken for granted that these are part of the physician’s duty to provide care.
It is recommended that each and every user carefully reads and follows the product information and compare it with the recommendations in the Guidelines on dosaging, contraindications, and drug interactions for completeness and currentness. Every dose or application is administered at the user’s own risk. The authors and the publishers kindly request that users inform them of any inaccuracies that they might notice. The users are requested to keep themselves constantly informed of any new findings subsequent to the publication of the Guidelines.
