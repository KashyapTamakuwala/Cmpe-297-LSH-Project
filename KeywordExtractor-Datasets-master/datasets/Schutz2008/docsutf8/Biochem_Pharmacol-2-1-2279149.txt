Abstract
N
-acetyltransferase type 1 (NAT1, EC 2.3.1.5), although first identified as a homologue of a drug-metabolising enzyme, appears to be a marker in human oestrogen receptor positive breast cancer. Mouse Nat2 is the mouse equivalent of human NAT1. The development of mouse models of breast cancer is important, and it is essential to explore the biological role of mouse Nat2. We have therefore produced mouse Nat2 as a recombinant protein and have investigated its substrate specificity profile in comparison with human NAT1. In addition, we have tested the effects of inhibitors on mouse Nat2, including compounds which are endogenous and exogenous steroids. We show that tamoxifen, genistein and diethylstilbestrol inhibit mouse Nat2. The steroid analogue, bisphenol A, also inhibits mouse Nat2 enzymic activity and is shown by NMR spectroscopy, through shifts in proton peaks, to bind close to the active site. A three-dimensional structure for human NAT1 has recently been released, and we have used this crystal structure to generate a model of the mouse Nat2 structure. We propose that a conformational change in the structure is required in order for ligands to bind to the active site of the protein.

In order to provide a firm foundation for establishing such a model, we have generated pure recombinant mouse Nat2 and investigated its activity with a wide range of substrates and the effects of a range of potential inhibitors, including endogenous and exogenous steroids.

Fractions containing hexa-histidine tagged Nat2 (His-Nat2), were pooled and thrombin (5 U/mg NAT) was added to remove the His-tag. After 16 h incubation at 4 °C, the protein sample was dialysed against 20 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 1 mM EDTA buffer, and concentrated to 1 mg/mL by centrifugation in a 15 mL concentrator (Amicon) after addition of 5% (v/v) glycerol. Protein samples in 100 μL aliquots were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C.

The titration of mouse Nat2 with bisphenol A was carried out by stepwise addition of small volumes (5–20 μL) of a concentrated solution of bisphenol A (100 mM in deuterated DMSO) to the mouse Nat2 solution in the NMR tube. The highest concentration of DMSO in the sample used was 2.8%. DMSO alone had no effect on the NMR spectrum of mouse Nat2 using concentrations up to 5%.

-estradiol, tamoxifen and 4-hydroxy tamoxifen. Bisphenol A was also shown to be an inhibitor of mouse Nat2, albeit with lower potency than some of the other compounds tested. One key practical advantage of using bisphenol A as an inhibitor is the improved solubility of this compound relative to the other phytoestrogens and steroids.

Fig. 4
 shows the structural model of mouse Nat2 and a comparison of the mouse Nat2 and human NAT1 protein structures. The two structures share 1191 equivalent atoms, over which the root mean squared deviation is 0.75 Å. In mouse Nat2, as in human NAT1, the inter-domain loop and the C-terminus occlude the active site. Despite the evidence for coenzyme A binding to human NAT2 without major conformational rearrangement of the C-terminus and inter-domain loop regions, it has not been possible to perform ligand docking into the mouse Nat2 or human NAT1 structures without disturbing these regions of the protein structure. Therefore, it remains possible that the inter-domain loop regions and C-termini of the eukaryotic NAT proteins are conformationally flexible, in order to accommodate substrate or inhibitor binding.

. These studies, together with the data on human NAT1 and breast cancer, are intriguing and are likely to provide clues as to the endogenous role of NAT1. The data presented increases the knowledge of mouse Nat2 in comparison with human NAT1 and reinforce the notion that mouse Nat2 is a good homologue of human NAT1. Mouse Nat2 has a similar substrate specific activity profile to human NAT1.
[39]
[40]

[41–44]
[45]

. Whether the effects on inhibition of Nat2 activity in vitro may be physiologically relevant for breast cancer prevention or therapy will require further analysis.
[20]
. The structural studies also provide a rational basis for identification of mouse Nat2 inhibitors. We have recently screened a 5000-strong compound library using human NAT1, human NAT2, mouse Nat1 and mouse Nat2; from these studies, several compounds been have identified which are potent and specific inhibitors of human NAT1 and its mouse homologue, Nat2. An accumulation of information on the eukaryotic NAT proteins at a structural level will allow further development of chemical tools for investigation of the role of this marker in breast cancer in humans, and its potential in animal models.

Thrombin cleavage of His-Nat2. Purified His-Nat2 was incubated with thrombin (5 U/mg NAT) at 4 °C for 6 h for complete His-tag cleavage. Lanes: M, low-range molecular weight marker (BioRad); 1, His-Nat2 only (8 μg); 2, thrombin-treated, Nat2 (8 μg).

. (c) and (d) A comparison of the human NAT1 crystal structure (PDB code 2IJA) and the mouse Nat2 homology model. The human NAT1 crystal structure is shown in blue and the mouse Nat2 model is shown in green. The two proteins share 82% identity at the amino acid level. Over 1191 equivalent atoms, the two structures have a root mean squared deviation of 0.75 Å. The catalytic triad residues for both proteins are shown in ball and stick representation. The views in (b) and (d) were obtained by rotating the structures shown in (a) and (c) by 30°. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of the article.)

H NMR spectra obtained in a titration of mouse Nat2 with bisphenol A. Spectra collected with 0–8 equivalents of bisphenol A are shown. Peaks are observed to shift and to broaden as increasing amounts of bisphenol A are added; this broadening may indicate chemical exchange within the bound protein. Some precipitation of protein was observed with 8 equivalents of bisphenol A, which is likely to account for the decrease in peak intensity in this spectrum.



Fig. 9
Titration of mouse Nat2 with bisphenol A. The magnitudes of changes in chemical shift observed for the four downfield shifted peaks are shown as a function of the amount of added bisphenol A. The largest shifts are observed for peaks 1 (filled circle) and 4 (open square) which arise from histidine; smaller shifts are observed for peaks 2 (open triangle) and 3 (filled triangle).
