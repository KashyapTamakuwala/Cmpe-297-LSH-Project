Primary retroperitoneal cystadenomas are extremely rare. This is the first report in literature to describe a primary retroperitoneal cystadenoma with a sarcoma-like mural nodule. A 45-year-old woman complained of a left-sided abdominal mass. A computed tomography scan revealed a cystic mass with a mural nodule, which seemed to originate from the tail of the pancreas. At laparotomy the cyst was not adhered to the pancreas but localized retroperitoneally. Histologic examination showed a mucinous cystadenoma with only foci of borderline malignancy with a mural “sarcoma-like” nodule. In view of the surgical and histopathological findings, the mucinous cystadenoma was regarded as primary retroperitoneal. This case demonstrates that in the era of radiological preoperative refinement, pathological diagnosis remains of utmost importance, especially for rare cases.

Introduction
Mucinous cystadenomas of the ovary are clinically and histopathologically well-established and common tumors. Primary retroperitoneal mucinous cystadenomas are extremely rare. Such tumors are histologically similar to ovarian mucinous cystadenomas. Their histogenesis is still unclear. We report a case of primary retroperitoneal mucinous cystadenoma with foci of borderline malignancy containing a mural “sarcoma-like” nodule.

Materials and methods
The specimen was fixed in 4% buffered formalin. Representative samples were routinely processed and embedded in paraffin blocks. Four-micrometer-thick sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and with parallel routine immunohistochemical procedures. The antigens tested by immunohistochemistry were: pan-keratin, keratin Cam 5.2, cytokeratin 7, cytokeratin 10, cytokeratin 18, cytokeratin 20, epithelial membrane antigen, vimentin, desmin, actin, myosin, CD34, CD68, CD99, CD117, S-100 protein, and bcl-2.

Discussion
Mucinous cystadenomas can be located in the ovaries, pancreas, and in the retroperitoneum. The mucinous cystadenoma presented was localized retroperitoneally near the pancreas but was clearly not adhered to it. Because normal-appearing ovaries were found, the cystadenoma was thought to be primary retroperitoneal.

Primary mucinous tumors of the retroperitoneum are very uncommon. These tumors can be classified into three clinicopathologic types: mucinous cystadenoma, mucinous cystic tumor of borderline malignancy, and mucinous cystadenocarcinoma. Our case was diagnosed as a primary retroperitoneal mucinous cystadenoma with only foci of borderline malignancy and a mural “sarcoma-like” nodule.

]. Benign pseudosarcomatous mural nodules are composed of a heterogeneous cell population of epulis-type giant cells, atypical spindle cells with bizarre nuclei and mitotic figures, mixed inflammatory cells, and signs of hemorrhage and necrosis. In these cases, immunohistochemical staining shows a weakly or focally cytokeratin positivity in the pseudosarcomatous cells.
