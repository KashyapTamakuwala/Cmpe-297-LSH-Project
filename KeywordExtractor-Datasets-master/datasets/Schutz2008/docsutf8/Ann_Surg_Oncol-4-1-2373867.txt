Background
To test the feasibility of laparoscopic approach in performing the simultaneous pelvic autonomic nerve preservation during standard anterior resection of sigmoid colon cancer.

Methods
Patients meeting appropriate eligibility criteria were recruited for the present study. The surgical procedures are shown in the video. The genitourinary function was evaluated on the basis of validated questionnaires including International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF), and Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI).

Conclusions
Under laparoscopy, we can clearly identify and preserve the pelvic autonomic nerves to retain genitourinary function in most patients undergoing oncologic resection of sigmoid colon cancer.

 Therefore, we conducted the present study to test the feasibility of laparoscopic approach in performing the total pelvic autonomic nerve preservation during the standard oncologic resection of sigmoid colon cancer. We hypothesized that given a well-illuminated magnified view by laparoscopy, the autonomic nerves can be well protected from inadvertent surgical damage.
PATIENTS AND METHODS

22
 Before entering the present study, all patients were well explained regarding the surgical procedures, and informed consents were obtained. The present study was approved by the Institutional Review board of National Taiwan University Hospital and was designated as NTUH 93S-024.

Assessment of Urinary Function
10
 The scoring system for voiding function described above was based on a 0 to 5 scale, as follows: 0, not at all; 1, less than one time in five; 2, less than half the time; 3, approximately half the time; 4, more than half the time; 5, almost always. IPSS was calculated by adding the item scores. We ranked the urinary function as good (IPSS, 0–7); fair (IPSS, 8–14), and poor (IPSS, 15–35). Any voiding problems recovered within 3 months after surgery was considered to be transient bladder voiding dysfunction; otherwise, the voiding problems were deemed persistent.

Assessment of Sexual Function
Sexual function was evaluated preoperatively and 6 months after operation or recovery from surgical complications, if present.
21
 Each item of the IIEF is scored on a 5- or 6-point Likert score. Score for each domain are variable, and the total score range is 5 to 75. We classified the male potency function as good (IIEF, 60–75), fair (IIEF, 44–59), and poor (IIEF, 5–43).
22
 The scale is divided into six domains: desire, arousal, lubrication, orgasm, satisfaction, and pain. Each item is scored with a 5- or 6- point Likert scale. The scales for each domain are variable, and the total score range is 4 to 95. For the present study, we classified the female sexual function as good (FSFI, 76–95), fair (FSFI, 58–75), and poor (FSFI, 4–57). Furthermore, the specific sexual problems in women such as libido, arousal, lubrication, orgasm, and dyspareunia were investigated.

Data Management
Data on patients undergoing laparoscopic autonomic nerve-preserving surgery for sigmoid colon cancer between January 2004 and December 2006 were entered into a prospective database of the present study. Until June 2007, the mean time of follow-up for the patients was 18 months, ranging from 6 to 36 months. The genitourinary function of the patients was analyzed by the intention-to-treat principle. Patients were first contacted by telephone by a research assistant who described the nature of the project. Those who consented to the present study were given a questionnaire-based interview by the research assistant. The data were managed by a statistician. To prevent bias of evaluation, the research assistant was not told which surgical procedure was performed for each individual patient.

) represented only 6 (10.3%) of the 58 male and 4 (7.4%) of 54 female patients in this case series and nerve injury related to obesity occurred in only 1 male patient, we therefore were not sure whether high BMI was a risk factor for nerve injury. Further recruitment of more obese patients for study will be necessary to solve this interesting question.
24

11
 However, the functional results of most reported series to date were based on the patients with rectal cancer undergoing open laparotomy. Therefore, further randomized studies in this respect that focus on sigmoid colon cancer are necessary.
15
 To clarify the role of pelvic sympathetics in the human genitourinary function, further recruitment of more patients with iatrogenic sympathetic nerve injury for study is required. Because the intentional severance of sympathetic nerve during the surgical practice is not ethical, we think that further study subjects will be focused on patients with an advanced rectosigmoid cancer in which unilateral or bilateral sympathectomy was a necessity for the radical resection of cancer.
In the present study, 6 patients (5.8%) had transient voiding disorder, 4 (9.1%) of 44 male patients had ejaculatory disorder, and up to 14.3% (6 of 42) female patients had sexual problems after the operation, even though their sympathetic nerves were successfully preserved during surgery. Our explanations for this phenomenon were as follows: first, anatomically, the inferior mesenteric plexus, thoracolumbar sympathetic splanchnic nerves, and superior hypogastric plexus were grossly manifested as a continuous plate of weblike connective tissues underlying the root of IMA and overlying the lower abdominal aortic and the interiliac trigone area. Therefore, some minor partial injury of nerve fibers may not be detected during surgery. Second, the retroperitoneal dissection by electrocauterization sometimes causes side injury and/or ischemia change of nerve fibers and thus compromised the neurophysiologic function. Third, the sexual function is influenced by various psychosocial factors. For example, the alteration of body image and/or bowel function after the operation may also have negative effect on sexual function.
21
22
 Second, in this study, both the patients and the assessors were informed of the intent to preserve the sympathetic nerves during sigmoidectomy but actually had no idea whether the nerve-preserving procedure was successful. The blinding of both assessors and patients to the surgical procedure can lessen the placebo effect. Third, the genitourinary function varies at different time points of evaluation. In this study, the evaluation of postoperative genitourinary function was conducted at the standardized time points before and after the operation. However, the preoperative baseline data was based on patient recall of genitourinary function before the appearance of bowel symptoms. The evaluation of baseline genitourinary function was therefore inevitably subject to methodology limitations, i.e., the potential recall bias. However, to validate the preoperative baseline data of patients, the spouses or sexual partners of some selected patients were also interviewed. We emphasize that patients were included in this study only when their normal baseline genitourinary function was ensured.
In conclusion, the genitourinary function of patients can be successfully preserved with good technical efficiency during laparoscopic sigmoidectomy. The present study should facilitate further study regarding the impact of preservation of genitourinary function on the postoperative quality of life for patients with sigmoid colon cancer.
