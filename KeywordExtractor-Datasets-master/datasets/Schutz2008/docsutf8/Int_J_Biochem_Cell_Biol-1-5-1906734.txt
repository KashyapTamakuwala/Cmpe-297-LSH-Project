 OD259, suggesting that this J-domain was unable to functionally interact with DnaK. Substitutions of conserved amino acid residues and motifs were made in all four helices (I–IV) and the loop regions of the J-domains, and the modified chimeric Hsp40s were tested for functionality using the in vivo assay. Substitution of a highly conserved basic residue in helix II of the J-domain was found to disrupt in vivo functionality for all the J-domains tested. We propose that helix II and the HPD motif of the J-domain represent the fundamental elements of a binding surface required for the interaction of Hsp40s with Hsp70s, and that this surface has been conserved in mammalian, parasitic and bacterial systems.

). This suggests that two broad classes of J-domains may have evolved; those J-domains that have evolved to specifically interact with Hsp70s involved in assisted protein folding, and those J-domains that have evolved to specifically interact with Hsp70s involved in more specialized cellular processes. To date no systematic analysis has been conducted on the interchangeability of J-domains between all the types I, II and III Hsp40-like proteins from any one cell type, compartment or system.
In this study we have conducted domain swapping of the J-domains from a selection of divergent Hsp40s of mammalian and parasitic origin (malarial Pfj1 and Pfj4, trypanosomal Tcj3, human ERj3, ERj5, and Hsj1, and murine ERj1) in an attempt to identify system specific and common factors in Hsp40–Hsp70 interactions. The similarities and differences in the structure and function of Hsp40s of parasites and their hosts have yet to be determined, and therefore from this broader perspective we were interested in a comparative analysis of the J-domains of parasitic and human origin. An in vivo functional assay was used to assess the ability of the J-domains to substitute for the J-domain of a prokaryotic type I Hsp40. Furthermore, the functional importance of specific residues was addressed through single amino acid substitution analysis. The data suggested that cytosolic and ER J-domains of mammalian and parasitic origin can interact with DnaK using a common mechanism, and that a fundamental binding surface appears to be conserved in J-domains of Hsp40s of mammalian, parasitic and bacterial origin.

BI restriction sites to allow subcloning into pRJ-B. Insertion of the coding region for the Tcj3 J-domain into the pRJ-B vector resulted in the creation of the expression construct encoding the Tcj3-J-Agt-DnaJ chimera. Similarly, the coding regions for the J-domains of Hsj1a (residues 1–72), ERj1 (residues 56–128), ERj3 (residues 23–97) and ERj5 (residues 35–100) were PCR amplified from pCMV-Tag3a (Hsj1a), pGEX-4T-ERj1, pGEX-4T-ERj3 and pGEX-4T-ERj5, respectively, and subcloned into pRJ-B to give expression constructs encoding Hsj1-J-Agt-DnaJ, ERj1-J-Agt-DnaJ, ERj3-J-Agt-DnaJ and ERj5-J-Agt-DnaJ. All mutations were produced by the whole-plasmid linear amplification approach using complementary oligonucleotides (QuikChange site directed mutagenesis kit, Stratagene, USA). Primers were designed so as to introduce or eliminate a restriction endonuclease site to facilitate the identification of successful mutants by restriction analysis. Mutations were confirmed by subsequent DNA sequencing.

For the ERj1-BiP pull-down binding assays, purified GST-ERj1-J and its mutant derivatives were buffer exchanged into phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at 4 °C so as to remove GSH from the purified protein. A sample (80 μl) of a 50% slurry of GSH-Sepharose beads was equilibrated in PBS (200 μl). Sufficient GST-ERj1-J was added to the GSH-Sepharose suspension to give 0.5 μM final concentration. The suspension was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C to allow binding of GST-ERj1-J to the GSH-beads, before washing twice with PBS (300 μl). For the binding reaction, the bead-bound GST-ERj1-J was reconstituted in 200 μl of PBS, with and without ATP (2 mM), and with BiP (0.5 μM), and binding allowed to occur for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed twice with PBS (200 μl), and the proteins eluted from the beads by treatment with SDS-PAGE sample treatment buffer (40 μl), and analysed by SDS-PAGE.

GST was bound to the immobilized antibodies in the reference cell, while the GST-ERj1-J fusion proteins were immobilized separately in the measuring cell (400 response units; flow rate 5 μl/min). Subsequently, solutions containing increasing concentrations of purified BiP (0.25–2 μM) were passed over the chip in the presence of ATP (flow rate 20 μl/min). Each BiP application was followed by the application of running buffer until baseline was reached. The analysis of the data were carried out using the BIAevaluation software version 2.2.4.

The results of the in vitro study on GST-ERj1-J-R26A were consistent with the results of the in vivo assays on mutant J-domain chimeras, where we have found that substitution of the equivalent residue at position 26 on helix II of other J-domains disrupted their functionality in the in vivo assay (J-domains of Pfj1, Pfj4 and HSJ1).

). Therefore, we propose that this basic residue of helix II together with the HPD motif of the loop region are important elements of a fundamental binding surface required for J-domain-based Hsp40-Hsp70 interaction. This fundamental binding surface appears to be conserved in J-domains of Hsp40s of mammalian, parasitic and bacterial origin.

). This finding suggests that the ERj1 J-domain has low affinity and specificity for DnaK, and is consistent with our findings. It would be worthwhile conducting a gain-of-function analysis on the ERj1 J-domain by changing certain divergent residues of the ERj1 J-domain to those found in other J-domains (e.g. Phe9 to Ile or Leu), and evaluating which residues promote a functional interaction with DnaK using both in vitro and in vivo assays.

). In this study, Pfj1-J-Agt-DnaJ-K63A was fully functional in the in vivo assay, and Pfj4-J-Agt-DnaJ-R63A was partially functional. While this result suggested that a basic residue at position 63 was not absolutely critical for J-domain-based interactions with Hsp70, it was consistent with its proposed role in the affinity or specificity of interaction.


4.3
Conclusion and future perspectives
This study has analysed cytosolic and ER Hsp40s of mammalian and parasitic origin, and found that certain key features of the J-domain appear to be fundamental to the function of all the J-domains studied, and perhaps to the function of J-domains in general. Interestingly, the differences appear to be subtle (e.g. the effects of the Y7A and R26A substitutions on the function of the J-domains of Hsj1 versus Pfj4), and may reflect slight differences in affinity or specificity of these J-domains for DnaK. These differences need to be probed further using quantitative in vitro assays, and incorporating an analysis of the less-conserved J-domain residues shown by NMR analysis to occur at J-domain-DnaK/Hsp70 binding interfaces. Furthermore, the possibility that there are specialized features unique to the J-domains of integral-membrane-bound Hsp40s needs to be investigated more extensively.

 OD259 were assessed by Western analysis: “+++’—higher levels than those observed for the positive control (Agt DnaJ); ‘++’—medium levels similar to those observed for Agt DnaJ; ‘+’—lower levels than those observed for Agt DnaJ.
