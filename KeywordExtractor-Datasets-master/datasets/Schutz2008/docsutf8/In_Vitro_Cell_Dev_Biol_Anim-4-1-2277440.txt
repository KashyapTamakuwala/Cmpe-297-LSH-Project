), and it was found that cooling the scalp to 20° C reduces local blood flow down to 20% of normal. A further decrease in temperature did not result in a further decrease in local blood flow. Based on this, it might be expected that there is a limit in temperature below which the effectiveness of scalp cooling will not increase anymore.

) showed that in vitro doxorubicin uptake in kidney cells at 37° C was 4.5 times higher than drug uptake at 4° C. In addition, Decorti also showed that doxorubicin uptake is dependent on extracellular concentration. Unfortunately, no studies have been performed to quantify these processes in the human hair follicle.
For a better understanding of the functioning of scalp cooling, it is important to quantify the contribution of reduced drug uptake and drug damage, if any, on the hair preservative effect of scalp cooling. To this end, we investigated experimentally the relationship between doxorubicin exposure and cell damage at different temperatures using normal human epidermal keratinocytes.

). Therefore, the use of keratinocytes as an in vitro model is indicative for chemotherapy-induced damage to the hair follicle. Moreover, human keratinocytes are commercially available and they are easy to cultivate, which means that with this model, a wide range of boundary conditions can quickly be investigated.
The goal of the experiments was to assess the effects of temperature and chemotherapy on keratinocyte survival.

 = 37° C). For each combination of temperature and doxorubicin concentration, a sample size of eight was used. Cells receiving medium without any doxorubicin were used as a control group for each specific temperature. At the end of the exposure time, doxorubicin was removed, and cells were washed with 500 μl phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Fresh medium (250 μl per well) was added to each well, and plates were then incubated at 37° C for a post-exposure time of 72 h, after which, a viability assay was performed as described below.

 = 0.199). This significant interaction term shows that the effect of temperature on cell viability is not the same at the levels of different doxorubicin concentrations. For low and high doxorubicin concentrations, there is hardly any influence of a lower temperature on cell survival. In the mid-section of the graph this influence is far more substantial.

Discussion
We examined the role reduced metabolism has on the hair preservative effect of scalp cooling. For this, a controlled in vitro experiment was conducted to assess the damage exerted by doxorubicin on human epidermal keratinocytes for a range of chemotherapy concentrations and exposure temperatures. The effects of temperature and doxorubicin on cell damage were determined from cell viability measurements (MTT assay).

 and higher. We found no significant differences between the low (10° C) and medium (22° C) group.
The results of the experiment are in line with the hypothesis of scalp cooling. In this hypothesis, the reduced temperature caused by scalp cooling will result in lower perfusion and a lower cellular metabolism. With this, the supply, uptake and damage of a chemotherapeutic agent will be diminished.

), the MTT assay for each temperature group showed a higher viability than the respective control group. Because of the fact that each specific temperature group has its own control group, it is unlikely that this effect is caused by a measurement error. This means that apparently, cells are metabolically more active when exposed to a small amount of doxorubicin. It is possible that cells in the control group are close to reaching confluence at the time that viability is determined. As cells reach confluence, there is not enough room for new cells. Therefore, the rate at which cells divide will become lower, and hence, their metabolic activity will decrease. Another possibility is that a small amount of doxorubicin will stimulate cells to repair damage exerted to the cells. Hence, it may actually result in larger cell growth compared to a control group receiving no doxorubicin. At this point, however, we have no indication for which explanation may be true.
Another remarkable result is that there is no significant difference between the medium and low temperature group. Thus, it seems that there is a limit in effect of reduced temperature. In a pilot study to determine optimal doxorubicin exposure temperature, we found that an exposure temperature of 26° C also showed increased cell viability (data not shown), and this increase did not differ from other temperature groups. During scalp cooling, a skin temperature of approximately 20° C is reached. Based on the results of our experiment, one might expect that the limit in effect of reduced temperature during scalp cooling may be reached for a temperature as high as 26° C. This means that during scalp cooling, the effect of reduced metabolism is already at its maximum. However, care has to be taken when the results of an in vitro experiment are generalized. Therefore, further studies on the effect of reduced temperature on cell damage are needed to exactly define this limit. Ideally, an in vitro hair follicle model is used in these studies. Our current study confines the boundary conditions in doxorubicin concentration and exposure temperature that can be used in these further studies.

). Cooling the scalp to approximately 18° C resulted in a decrease in perfusion to 20%. Further cooling did not result in any further decrease in perfusion. The findings of the current study indicate that there is no difference in cell survival between 22° C and 10° C. Based on these findings, we can conclude that there is an optimal temperature in scalp cooling. Further cooling will only result in unnecessary discomfort for the patient. Therefore, strong cooling during scalp cooling should be avoided.
