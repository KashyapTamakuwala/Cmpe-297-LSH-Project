Over the past century, many animal experiments have shown that caloric restriction can reduce the risk of cancer, a finding that proved to be highly reproducible. Many papers have been published on its potential for human health, but until know little evidence is available on its actual effects in humans. In Utrecht, The Netherlands, we have been investigating the effects of the 1944–1945 Dutch famine on breast cancer risk factors and breast cancer risk, and paradoxically the relatively short-term famine seemed to be related to increased breast cancer risk in later life. One of the differences between the famine situation and the large body of evidence from animal experiments is the duration of caloric restriction. Almost all animal experiments investigated sustained caloric restriction and information on the effects of short-term transient caloric restriction is very scarce. A search in the literature identified some animal experiments on short-term transient caloric restriction and these seemed to be at least supportive to the famine findings. Because caloric restriction in humans for preventive health measures would be mostly short-term, it is important to extend animal research on short-term caloric restriction.

Therefore, this “experiment of history”—as most current famines due to crop disaster or war—is only similar to experiments in rodents that studied short-term caloric restriction followed by ad libitum feeding, whereas the vast majority of these studies investigated dietary interventions that were sustained throughout the animals entire live.

The disparity between our findings in humans after caloric restriction during a short and severe famine and the abundant literature on sustained caloric restriction and cancer risk in rodents may be ascribed to differences in exposure duration, as is corroborated by the abovementioned animal studies on transient caloric restriction that are in line with the famine observations.

In conclusion, the general notion that caloric restriction prevents cancer needs some amendment, even for rodents. Evidence is strong that during caloric restriction, cancer risk is decreased proportionally to the amount of restriction, and such interventions can be effective whether started in early life or later. However, a short and transient period of restriction followed by a “normal” diet does not show such effects and could actually be detrimental.

]. The generalisability of these observations is however troubled as factors underlying this disease may contribute to the decrease in breast cancer risk, so this may not merely be ascribed to a decreased caloric intake per se.
Currently, the relation between famine exposure in early life and risk of other types of cancer than that of the breast is largely unknown. It would be valuable to further investigate these relations to see whether associations are different between cancer types, e.g. comparing hormone to non-hormone associated cancer types. This would give further insight into whether general mechanisms in human cancer aetiology are involved or whether adaptation of hormonal axes leading to harmful hormone concentrations is the potential culprit.
