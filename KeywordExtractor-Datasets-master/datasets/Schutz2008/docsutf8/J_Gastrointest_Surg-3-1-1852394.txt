A 41-year-old Chinese woman was admitted to our hospital with epigastric pain. Computed tomography detected a heterogeneous enhancement tumor fed by the left gastroepiploic artery in the left lower quadrant and cholelithiasis. Excision of the tumor in the greater omentum and cholecystectomy were performed laparoscopically. Histological findings confirmed a diagnosis of hemangiopericytoma with low-grade malignancy. To our knowledge, hemangiopericytoma of the greater omentum is very rare, and only 12 cases were reported in English literature. We report a case of hemangiopericytoma arising in the greater omentum and review the literature.

Figure 1
Enhanced computed tomography exhibited a well-defined heterogeneous tumor with contrast enhancement in the left lower quadrant of the abdomen, and demonstrated that the left gastroepiploic artery (arrow) was feeding the tumor.



Figure 2
A solitary tumor arose in the greater omentum and was connected with the greater omentum by a vascular pedicle.



Figure 3
The resected tumor measured 55 × 45 × 40 mm, weighed 68.5 g, and was solid and encapsulated without central necrosis or hemorrhage.

, tumor size and mitotic index related to tumor recurrence after resection.
Because most recurrences developed at distant sites, i.e., the liver, lung, and peritoneum, systemic chemotherapy may be an additional treatment for hemangiopericytoma with high malignant potential after resection and for recurrence. However, effective chemotherapeutic regimens and molecular targeting therapy have not been established to date. Because three of the four patients who underwent omentectomy in the literature had peritoneal recurrences, the significance of omentectomy is questionable, especially for these with low-grade malignancy like in our patient. Therefore, surgical resection provides the only opportunity of cure for patients with hemangiopericytoma arising in the greater omentum. For pedunculated tumors like in our patient, laparoscopic excision is feasible.
