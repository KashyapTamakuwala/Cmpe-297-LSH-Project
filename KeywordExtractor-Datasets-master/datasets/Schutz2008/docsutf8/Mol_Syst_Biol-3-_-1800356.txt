Predicted regulatory interactions are supported by statistical evidence, and provide a foundation for targeted experiments that will improve our understanding of tissue-specific regulatory networks. In a broader context, methods used to construct the catalog provide a model for the analysis of genomic regions that regulate differentially expressed genes.

Introduction

). Here, focusing on tissue-specific regulatory pattern identification and prediction accuracy instead of proof of existence, we use refined analysis and data curation methods to discover and catalog high-confidence regulatory interactions and sites. This catalog will assist experimental efforts to reverse engineer tissue-specific transcriptional regulatory networks from the bottom up.

 describe cisRed, a database that integrates genome annotation data, homology data and genome alignments to identify motifs with conserved sites across mammals. We analyzed proximal promoters with evidence for tissue-specific regulation in order to identify tissue-specific motifs, modules and their sites in proximal promoters. We developed a new technique for characterizing tissue-specific modules that ensures that each module component significantly improves tissue-specific module enrichment.

Results
We describe first steps toward cataloging high-confidence tissue-specific motifs, modules and their sites. We first collected and integrated expression and function data from various sources, and identified transcripts that are likely to be under tissue specific regulation. We demonstrated that transcripts with evidence for tissue-specific regulation from multiple expression sources in one species (human or mouse) are significantly more likely to have evidence for tissue-specificity in the other species. We analyzed and annotated proximal-promoter sets in seven representative tissues from both human and mouse, demonstrating that motifs and predicted binding sites are in agreement with experimentally verified data and that analyses in human and mouse are significantly correlated. We also showed that the top-scoring sites in orthologous tissue-specific promoters from human and mouse rarely have significant conservation of site order, suggesting that comparative genomics alone may not be sufficient to decode the regulatory signals in these proximal promoters.

 also includes information for HNF-6 in liver. HNF-6 is a known liver regulator, but there is no evidence for its expression in liver based on our data, and its binding-site motif was not enriched in our liver foreground sets. In addition, C/G- or A/T-rich motifs are likely to be enriched in foreground sets that are C/G or A/T rich relative to promoter base composition. To eliminate this potential bias, we adjusted the GC content in background sets to match foreground sets. Some known tissue-specific motifs were identified as enriched only after GC content correction.

Materials and methods
The steps used in creating the catalog include (1) identifying tissue-specific transcripts, (2) identifying factors that are expressed in each tissue, (3) obtaining promoter sequences for tissue-specific transcript, and (4) identifying individual motifs and modules (i.e. sets of interacting motifs) that characterize tissue-specific promoter sets.
Identifying tissue-specific transcripts
To identify motifs and modules that regulate tissue-specific transcription, we analyzed promoters of transcripts that appear to be regulated in a tissue-specific manner. If an information source indicated that a transcript has restricted expression, unusually high expression, or a specific function in the tissue, that source voted for tissue specificity of the transcript. For each tissue, we sorted the transcripts according to the number of votes received, retaining the top 100 with distinct TSS as tissue specific. Ties in the ranking were broken according to intensity values from the GNF SymAtlas expression data (discussed below), which we have found to be the most complete and the most reliable source of tissue-based expression information. We used the same number of transcripts for each tissue to facilitate comparison across tissues, and 100 sequences provided sufficient information for our analysis while allowing identification of well-known tissue-specific motifs.

Microarray data
et al
, 2004
). Among these are the seven tissues we selected to include in the catalog. Tissues were selected with consideration to data availability in GNF and other sources and interest from Zhang lab members and collaborators. A transcript received a vote for tissue specificity from this information source if it was called present and its intensity exceeded its mean across all tissues by 3 standard deviations.
et al
, 2004
), which was generated using custom-built oligonucleotide arrays, provide mouse expression profiles for 55 tissues, including all of our tissues but CD4 T cells. A transcript received a vote for tissue specificity if it was called present in the tissue, and had intensity at least 10 standard deviations above its mean across all 55 tissues. This large number of standard deviations was required to limit the number of transcripts receiving positive votes.
et al
, 2003
), which were generated using the Affymetrix GeneChip HG-U95, provide human expression data for 12 tissues, including all of our tissues but CD4 T cells and testis. The GeneNote data were used in the same way as the GNF SymAtlas data, with a transcript being called tissue specific if it is present in that tissue and has intensity at least 3 standard deviations above its mean across all 12 tissues.

EST data
et al
, 1993
), and contains source information, such as the tissue of origin, for each EST. This information is used to annotate UniGene clusters with the source data, and a UniGene is said to have restricted expression in a tissue if more than half of the ESTs contributing to that UniGene have the same source tissue. A transcript received one vote for specificity in a particular tissue if the corresponding UniGene cluster is annotated as having expression restricted to that tissue.

GO terms
We associated a set of GO Terms with each tissue. This was performed by compiling a set of keywords for each tissue (e.g. ‘renal' was associated with kidney; ‘sperm' was associated with testis), and searching GO Term names and definitions for those keywords. This produced, for each tissue, a set of GO Terms that were subsequently reviewed to ensure that the context of the keywords was appropriate. A transcript of a gene annotated with a GO Term that is associated with a tissue received a vote for specificity in that tissue.

Selecting promoter sequences
et al
, 2006
et al
, 1998
et al
, 2002
) and GenBank, as well as computationally predicted promoters. For each promoter, we used the proximal sequence region of −1000 to +100 relative to the TSS.
Each part of our analysis is based on comparing the tissue-specific promoter sets to a background of random promoters from the same species. For each tissue, a background set was constructed by selecting 1000 transcripts uniformly at random from the set of RefSeqs for the corresponding species with TSS annotation in CSHLmpd. For each tissue, transcripts with at least one vote for specificity in that tissue were removed from consideration before selecting the background.
Charbonneau and Luu-The, 1999
et al

). Negative promoter sets can be used to cancel out patterns that are not related to tissue-specific transcription regulation. We use random negative promoter sets with and without GC-content correction; this correction cancels the inuence of genomic GC-content isochore variability.

), to construct modules. Given a set of motifs, a set of foreground sequences and a set of background sequences, MODULATOR identifies those modules composed of the given motifs that have the best balanced-error rates. A branch-and-bound algorithm is used to simultaneously optimize the score thresholds for the motifs in a module. Modules are constructed by adding motifs to existing modules until a user-specified module size is reached or until motif addition does not significantly improve enrichment. Each time a motif is added to a module, the resulting larger module is retained only if the balanced-error rate of the larger module is improved significantly above expectation. The initial modules of size two are obtained by combining pairs of motifs.
