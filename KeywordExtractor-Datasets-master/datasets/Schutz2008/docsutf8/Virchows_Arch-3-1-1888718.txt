The recent World Health Organization (WHO) classification of hematopoietic and lymphoid tissue tumors represents the first worldwide consensus classification of these malignancies. However, the applicability of this classification to a representative number of hepatic lymphomas in liver biopsy specimens has not yet been investigated. The frequency and infiltration pattern of a series of 205 liver biopsies with lymphoma manifestations was analyzed with the aid of immunohistochemical and molecular pathological analyses. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) was by far the most frequent entity, comprising 45% of the cases analyzed. Using a previously published immunohistochemical algorithm, 35% of 80 DLBCL were assigned to a germinal center B-cell-like (GCB) and 65% to a non-GCB group. Most B-cell lymphoma entities involving the liver revealed a characteristic infiltration pattern. Diagnostically challenging entities were T-cell-rich B-cell lymphomas, anaplastic large cell lymphomas and peripheral T-cell lymphomas, which frequently required additional molecular clonality assessment. Overall, the percentage of T-cell lymphomas in the liver (12%) was higher as compared to other extranodal sites except for the skin and the small intestine. This study provides relevant data on the distribution of hepatic lymphomas and demonstrates the applicability of the WHO classification proposing a diagnostic algorithm for liver biopsies.

Overall, this study represents the largest series on hepatic lymphomas to date and due to its restriction to bioptic material reflects the primary diagnostic situation.

]. For cases in which the diagnosis was not unanimous, a final consensus diagnosis was reached after further immunophenotyping, molecular analyses, and final consultation. In six cases initially considered “suspicious” for lymphoma, a final diagnosis of lymphoma was made after reevaluation and additional analyses. Nine liver biopsies with insufficient material for additional immunohistochemical or molecular analyses were excluded beforehand, as well as five cases where T-cell receptor (TCR) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) had revealed a polyclonal or oligoclonal rearrangement pattern without a reproducible dominant PCR product.
Overall, 32/205 (16%) cases were reclassified, including eight “low-grade” [5× B-CLL, 2× follicular lymphomas (FL), 1× marginal zone lymphoma (MZL)] and 20 “high-grade” [19× DLBCL, 1× Burkitt lymphoma (BL)] B-cell NHL that were assigned to a specific WHO lymphoma category as well as four cases with a change in the final diagnosis [BL, classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL), T-cell-rich B-cell lymphoma (TCRBCL), lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (LPL) to DLBCL, anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), peripheral T-cell lymphoma (pTCL) and B-CLL, respectively].
The analyses of the infiltration pattern were based on the assessment of the hepatic architecture. Three main patterns were distinguished: Infiltrates for which an exclusive or predominant association to portal tracts was evident were recorded as portal infiltrates. The second pattern consisted of lymphoma infiltrates which showed a coherent growth pattern thus predominantly resulting in the replacement of the acinar structures. These infiltrates were designated as a nodular growth pattern. Finally, infiltrates that showed prominent intrasinusoidal dispersion of the lymphoma cells were recorded as a sinusoidal growth pattern. Additionally, the density of the infiltrate was semiquantitatively assessed. The presence of scattered neoplastic cells in a background rich in reactive bystander cells (e.g., nonneoplastic T-cells and/or macrophages in T-cell rich B-cell lymphoma) was defined as a loose infiltration pattern, whereas the appearance of coherently appearing neoplastic B- or T-cells was referred to as a dense infiltrate.
According to clinical information available, in 76/205 (37%) of the cases the diagnosis of a lymphoma had been previously established from extrahepatic biopsies or peripheral blood indicating secondary involvement of the liver. In four of these cases with known low-grade lymphoma (2× B-CLL, 2× FL) liver biopsy revealed transformation to a high-grade lymphoma (DLBCL). In the remaining cases, the biopsy obtained from the liver represented the site of primary diagnosis. In 26 (13%) patients, additional biopsies from extrahepatic sites were available (13 bone marrow biopsies, 10 lymph node biopsies, and three spleen biopsies). Furthermore, in a few cases clinical data regarding a potential predisposing condition for a primary hepatic lymphoma was available: chronic hepatitis C was reported in four patients (3× DLBCL, 1× B-CLL), HIV infection was present in three patients (2× DLBCL, 1× BL), and one marginal zone lymphoma occurred in a patient after liver transplantation.
The frequency of the various lymphoma entities diagnosed in liver biopsy specimen was compared to their frequency and distribution in other extranodal sites (cases from the Consultation and Reference Center for Lymph Node Pathology and Hematopathology, Berlin).

Amplification of rearranged IgH genes was independently performed at least twice per case employing three different framework primer sets (BioMed-2 FR1, FR2, and FR3) separately in conjunction with a JH primer (JH22). PCR conditions consisted of 50 cycles of denaturation (95°C, 15 s), primer annealing (60°C, 40 s), and elongation (72°C, 45 s), and the reaction mixture contained 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.8 mM deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs), 70 pmol VH primers, 30 pmol JH22 primer, and 2 U of AmpliTaq Gold polymerase (Applied Biosystems, Weiterstadt, Germany).

Comparison of hepatic lymphomas with other extranodal lymphomas
The percentage of T-cell lymphomas was considerably higher in the liver (12%, 25/205) when compared to other extranodal sites (5%, 165/3252) except for the skin (50%, mainly mycosis fungoides/Sézary syndrome) and small intestine (34%, mainly enteropathy-type T-cell lymphomas).

Discussion

]. Our data demonstrate the feasibility of in vivo lymphoma subtyping in liver biopsy with the aid of infiltration pattern analysis, the selection of differentiating immunophenotypic markers and additional molecular methods.
Many B-cell-derived lymphomas involving the liver revealed a characteristic infiltration pattern, which facilitated the use of a restricted panel of immunohistochemical markers to reach a final diagnosis. This approach is critical in those liver biopsies in which a lymphoma diagnosis has previously not been established, as accurate subtyping of lymphomas is fundamental for the initiation of adequate treatment.

).
Similarly, the distinction between a T-cell lymphoma and a drug-induced or viral hepatitis (e.g., due to Epstein-Barr virus) can be very difficult in biopsies containing an increased number of sinusoidal T-cells. Therefore, additional clonality analyses by TCR or IgH PCR were necessary in 5 out of 19 (26%) T-cell lymphomas compared to only 3 out of 116 (3%) B-cell lymphomas to establish a diagnosis.

).
In summary, the present study demonstrates the feasibility of subtyping lymphoma infiltrates in liver biopsies according to the WHO classification. The large number of 205 cases provides reliable information regarding the relative frequencies of the different lymphoma entities encountered in the liver and demonstrates the usefulness of infiltration pattern analysis for diagnostic purposes.
