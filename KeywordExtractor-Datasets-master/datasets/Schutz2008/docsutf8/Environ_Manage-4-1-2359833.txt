During the past decades, the traditional state monopoly in urban water management has been debated heavily, resulting in different forms and degrees of private sector involvement across the globe. Since the 1990s, China has also started experiments with new modes of urban water service management and governance in which the private sector is involved. It is premature to conclude whether the various forms of private sector involvement will successfully overcome the major problems (capital shortage, inefficient operation, and service quality) in China’s water sector. But at the same time, private sector involvement in water provisioning and waste water treatments seems to have become mainstream in transitional China.

) and questions of equity and equality are still heavily debated, in particular with respect to the water sector and less so regarding other utilities.
Although private sector participation in the water sector is one of the more controversial topics in public utility management today, this wave also spread to China at the turn of the millennium, where the government started to reform public sectors (water, electricity, roads, etc.) via introducing market functions. The so-called marketization reform expected to address the increase of several water problems (water shortage, insufficient infrastructure, water pollution, etc.) to meet the requirement posed by accelerated urbanization and high economic growth. As a late comer in this field of private sector involvement in the provision of water services, China is able to learn from numerous experiences of other countries, such as the United Kingdom, France, United States, Chile, Philippines, Mexico, Argentina, and Bolivia.

). Tariff reform with full-cost recovery, competitive bidding procedures, changing ownership structures (e.g., public and private, Sino and foreign), and restrictive fiscal policies are part of it.
This article reviews developments in private sector involvement in China’s water management and assesses whether expected results of marketization in the Chinese water sector have been met: raising investment for infrastructure, increasing service coverage and improved efficiency in China’s water supply and wastewater treatment. After interpreting further private sector involvement in China’s urban water management in terms of modernizing water governance, this article provides a country-wide overview of current privatization developments in the Chinese water sector, and subsequently makes an in-depth investigation in three distinct cases with respect to the new roles and functions of the governments and private parties. The final section assesses the current status of privatization programs in China’s water management and its implications of future research on water governance reform.

Private Sector Participation as Part of Modernizing Urban Water Governance
In the debate on private sector participation in environmental governance in general, and urban water governance in particular, we can identify three — sometimes interrelated — discourses.

) formulated his Risk Society hypothesis and identified subpolitical arrangements (i.e., arrangements for environmental protection and service provision without and beyond the public state) as an alternative for the conventional environmental politics of the nation-state. Inspired by these and several other authors and ideas, from the mid 1980s onward environmental social science scholars started to develop ideas, investigate practices, and formulate theories on governing environmental problems, in which the environmental state was given a less dominant and monopolistic position.

In exploring the degree, nature, and forms of private sector participation in China’s urban water governance in the following sections; we have to leave these wider — related — developments aside.

Privatization Policy in China’s Water Sector
Circular on Attracting Foreign Investment through BOT Approach
Circular on Major Issues of Approval Administration of the Franchise Pilot Projects with Foreign Investment
 (No.208 Policy Paper of Foreign Investment, the former National Development and Planning Commission, the Ministry of Electric Power Industry, and the Ministry of Communications, 1995). These two policy papers formed the first legal ground for private sector involvement and foreign capital investment in Chinese urban infrastructure. Subsequently, the National Development and Reform Commission firstly approved three BOT infrastructure projects in 1996, including Chengdu No.6 Water Supply BOT Plant (B), Guangxi Laibin Power BOT Plant, and Changsha Wangcheng Power BOT Plant (failed).
The earlier experiences of BOT projects brought in needed capital and investment to develop China’s urban water infrastructure. But it illustrated also many problems. The issue of the fixed investment return to investors was one of these problems. After intensifying control over foreign exchanges and loans in the late 1990s, the General Office of the State Council promulgated a specific circular in 2002 to correct foreign investment projects with fixed investment returns, by modifying the relevant contract terms, buying back all shares of foreign investors, transferring foreign investment into foreign loans, or dismantling contracts with often severe losses.
Opinions on Accelerating the Marketization of Public Utilities
Measures on Public Utilities Concession Management
 (No.126 Policy Paper of the MOC, 2004; in this policy, “concession management” refers to all forms of private sector participation.) of 2004 specifies the procedure of how to involve the private sectors in public utilities through awarding concession right, but still relies heavily on BOT modes.

): (1) the water transnational corporations (e.g., VEOLIA and SUEZ); (2) Chinese investment developers (e.g., Beijing Capital Group and Tianjin Capital Environmental Protection Co. Ltd.); (3) liberalized water companies (e.g., Shenzhen Water Group and Beijing Sewerage Group); and (iv) environmental engineering corporations (e.g., Beijing Sound Group and Tsinghua Tongfang Water Engineering Corporation). In December of 2004, the Ministry of Construction called provincial-level authorities to summarize marketization of public sectors (e.g., water and wastewater, solid waste, gas, and public transportation). In July of 2005, a follow-up field survey was organized by the MOC, in which the authors have participated. All reported data of this section come from the reports of provincial-level authorities, supplemented by surveys of the Water Policy Research Center of Tsinghua University (in which authors participated).

 visualizes the provincial distribution of water projects with private sector participation. At least 25 provinces have private sector participation experience in water supply and 23 provinces in wastewater treatment. The form of private sector participation is determined by the level of development of water/wastewater infrastructure, as well as the local economic, social and political conditions. With richer markets, more open economic policies and higher payment capacity of local residents, the southern coastal (e.g., Guangdong and Fujian) and the eastern coastal (e.g., Jiangsu) provinces witnessed high levels of reform in their water sector. Over 60% of foreign private sector investment in water supply projects and about 50% foreign private sector investment in wastewater projects were implemented in these coastal regions, according to the MOC survey. In the meanwhile, the first national BOT pilot project of Chengdu Water Supply (Sichuan Province) has triggered a wave of private sector participation in and around Sichuan Province (including Chongqing and Yunnan). Furthermore, the special environmental protection policies related to “The Three Gorges” dam might have impelled private sector participation in wastewater sector of Sichuan Province and Chongqing.

, in water supply the joint venture approach dominates in 19 provinces. In the wastewater sector, Greenfield projects (including BOT and TOT) dominate in 12 provinces. The commercialization of traditional state-owned water enterprises was adopted more widely in inland provinces (such as Gansu, Heilongjiang, Jilin, Sichuan, Xinjiang, Yunnan) than in coastal provinces. A joint venture approach for private sector involvement in the wastewater sector was only adopted in provinces with high wastewater treatment charges, such as Beijing, Fujian, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai.

), making them rather best practices than representative cases. But together they illustrate the institutional transformations that come along private sector involvement.
Joint Venture: Maanshan Water Supply
Maanshan City is an industrial, prefecture-level city of 1686 square kilometers, and a population of 1.24 million (2004), of whom 46.8 per cent lives in urban areas. According to the 2004 MOC statistics, 88.7 per cent of the urban population has access to water supply. Water resources are abundant in Maanshan City due to its advantageous location on the south bank of the Yangtze River and abundant annual rainfall (1062–1092 mm). Maanshan Construction Commission (MASCC) is not only the competent authority for water supply and wastewater treatment and as such, plays a leading role in the water sector reform. It is also, as a so-called “Big Construction Commission,” the main governmental agency responsible for urban planning, construction, and management (cf Wu 2003).

Organizational structure of Maanshan water supply system




Within the new joint venture structure, the board of MAS-BCWLC (4 members from BCG and 3 from WASWSC) is the current decision-maker regarding planning (within the objectives set by the municipal master planning), investment and financing, partly replacing the tradition of government decision structures. According to the contract, the general manager of the joint venture company comes alternately from MASWSC and BCG. Taking into account the social dimensions of water provisioning, the government claimed three key conditions in the agreement with the concessionaire: first, the concessionaire (MAS-BCWLC) must ensure sufficient and safe water provision and the government can take over all facilities without any indemnity if the concessionaire fails; second, the concessionaire cannot change the public and social nature of water and should include relevant social responsibilities as governmental requirements (e.g., employing all personnel from the old water company, providing free water for firefighting, reducing/subsidizing water bills of the poor); third, the government controls the water price.
In order to ensure high-quality water and service, MASCC regulates the performance of MAS-BCWLC via assessing annually the specified objectives approved by both the MAS-BCWLC board and MASCC. For instance, MAS-BCWLC was requested to achieve 12 key objectives in 2004: (1) investment of 18 million RMB (ca. 2.175 million US$ at the exchange rate of 1US$ = 8.276RMB); (2) selling 48 million cubic meter water or more and reclaiming >90% of water bills; (3) fulfilling indicators of water service quality (for instance, >99% of the control points should reach the required water quality standards; >98% control points should reach standards for water pressure; a maximum of 30% water loss; burst pipes repairs within maximum time limits); (4) fulfilling all MASCC indicators for safe work; (5) construction of the main body of the No.4 WTP and 25 kilometer new pipes; (6) fulfilling client service indicators (for instance, 100% good client service; >90% public satisfaction); (7) fulfilling the reconstruction of Xiangshan Town water supply system; (8) elaboration and submitting a water supply plan; (9) achieving the relevant objectives of National Civilized City Assessment System (which was proposed by Central Cultural and Ideological Building Commission in 2004; it includes 119 indicators); (10) submitting water supply plans to Municipal People’s Congress and Municipal People’s Political Consultative Conference; (11) responding adequately to complaints and reporting this information to the government; and (12) take anti-corruption measures.

However, this private sector involvement practice of Maanshan is argued to have a (potential) political risk due to the lack of a sound legal basis. In transitional China, in particular, policies are perceived to be instable and insufficiently law-based. Until now, details on measures and rules to regulate private utility companies are still missing in current national and Anhui provincial policy papers (Maanshan has no legislation right). This is a common problem in Chinese marketization practices in the water sector, as argued by many lawyers and academics. For instance, Shenyang water supply has experienced several failed marketization practices due to the constantly changing policies and decisions of the local government during 1995–2000 (field survey 2004).

Distinct from the previous private owners, who had little experience in the field of water provision, SUEZ (France) brought in advanced water knowledge and technology. According to the concession contract, MWSL must provide high-quality water supply service, as well as bear several obligations, such as planning, investment, construction, operation, and maintenance of the infrastructure under the supervision of Macao Government. In practice, Macau Government has delegated tasks, responsibilities and obligations to a very large degree to MWSL.

 per month. Since May 2005 the “Water for All” program offers free water consumption to other categories of people in needs, such as single-parent families and disabled. But also in addition, it built two potable “Wallace fountains” (a special public fountain with potable water) in Macau, providing free potable water to tourists and citizens. MWSL has also been active in various social welfare and charity activities, providing total donations of 2.08 million MOP (1MOP = 0.965RMB, 2007; ca. 0.26 million US$ at the exchange rate of 1US$ = 8.276RMB) during 2002–2005. During 1985–2005, MSWL also charged discounted water tariffs for governmental agencies, and handed in over 260 million MOP (1MOP = 0.965RMB, 2007; ca. 32.56 million US$ at the exchange rate of 1US$ = 8.276RMB) of taxes and about 56 million MOP (1MOP = 0.965RMB, 2007; ca. 7.012 million US$ at the exchange rate of 1US$ = 8.276RMB) of concession fees to the government.

Macau is also an interesting case because of the unique regulatory system, which includes the water quality regulator (IACM), and a unique Government Delegate. IACM is in charge of the water quality regulation, and monitors and controls drinking water quality by random sampling and analysis of over 70 water samples around Macau everyday. The Government Delegate is not a government official, but an individual working in another public utility company and appointed by the government. Following Macau laws, Mr. Lin Runzhong, the Government Delegate for water supply, was appointed for a period of five years by the Macau Government, and is not only the regulator of MWSL, but also an important linkage between MWSL and the government. He participates at all MWSL board meetings and reports relevant information and documents to the government. The Government Delegate decides which information is considered relevant. He is also in charge of assessing the performance of MWSL, and comments on the five-year plans and tariff plans before MWSL sends these to the government for approval. The Macau government generally follows the comments and assessments of the Government Delegate. In this sense, the nongovernmental Government Delegate is defined a specified role and powerful position in governing the water sector. This institutional arrangement relates to the small size of Macau Government, where only a limited state capacity (in quantitative and qualitative terms) is available for numerous public tasks. In conclusion, it can be argued that after 1985 the Macau government has played a meager role in the drinking water management.

Conclusions
With the emergence and blossoming of various forms of private sector involvement in the Chinese water sector, the traditional structure of full governmental provision of water supply and wastewater treatment has changed dramatically. The analysis in this article has provided evidence of the contribution of these new modes to increased capital investment, and especially of more efficient operations and improved service provision. In that sense, the original goals of the Chinese government to embark upon private sector involvement in water provisioning and treatment have been met. However, the early stage that most contracts are in, and the not yet crystallized forms and modes of privatization, prevents us from drawing any final conclusions on the impact of private sector involvement in the Chinese water sector.

) state, most practices of water privatization fail due to public resistance following sharp price increases and job losses. In China, this has not (yet) been the case, due to large increases in efficiencies and governmental support to fixed infrastructure assets, reducing financial risk of the private sector and limiting the need for large water tariff increases. At the same time, the significant economic growth levels enables local residents to cope with some tariff increases, the poor and disadvantaged have been subsidized by the government, job losses have been minimized following social policies, and public hearings have contributed to higher levels of legitimacy. This all contributed strongly to a relatively smooth transformation of China’s water sector.

), while Joint Venture approaches are often used in cities with sufficiently high water tariff, in particularly in the water supply sector.
Thirdly, it is crucial to accelerate the establishment of systematic and comprehensive governmental regulatory framework, as the current ad hoc, fragmented and diverse regulatory system endangers efficiency in water service development and certainty and stability for foreign investors. Experiences in many countries have proven that regulation is a key aspect in successful privatization in the water sector and a competitive benchmarking system is regarded as useful in an effective regulatory approach. In late 2006, the MOC attempted to develop a Chinese water supply benchmarking system, which is still ongoing. However, the current private sector involvements in the Chinese water sector still face many legal and regulatory uncertainties. Too often local authorities experiment with systems of governmental regulation and control, or — as in Macau — seem to become marginalized. According to interviews with local officials during our fieldwork, the importance of establishing a workable regulatory and legal system is essential. Guaranteeing sufficient and safe water service to the public is jeopardized by the fact that governments can no longer fully control the planning, operation, and management of water services as before private sector participation. This might only be signs of uneasiness with the new water institutions and division of tasks and responsibilities, but can also be the heralds of an emerging debate on privatization in the Chinese water sector.

 and the three case-study projects illuminate, with the various forms of privatization, the government often transfers (smaller or larger parts of) financial risks, building risks, and operation and maintenance risks to the private sector. Meanwhile, in the end the government can always take over all facilities without paying an indemnity to the private sector if a concessionaire fails in obtaining the goals as formulated by governmental authorities, or some conflicts emerge in the further policies (e.g., the terminated contracts that are regarded as providing the private sector a fixed investment return). In that sense, the still unstable legal base in transitional China provides a major political and transfer risk for private investors.
