], patients’ mean serum phosphate values were 6.5–6.6 mg/dl. Our values may have been lower because our patients adhered more closely to their diet, they were receiving an adequate dose of hemodialysis or they had neither marked hyperparathyroidism (siPTH <500 pg/ml) nor did they receive vitamin D. The Mediterranean type of diet consumed by our population on the island of Crete is less likely to cause hyperphosphatemia.

).
In terms of the biochemical findings, the main difference between the two groups was the levels of serum calcium. Hypercalcemia is the price one has to pay for adequate phosphate-binding control with calcium-containing binders; the absence of hypercalcemia is the major advantage of magnesium-based phosphate-binders.

 group. We speculate that the shape of this curve indicates that suppressive action of serum magnesium on the parathyroid glands is weaker but delayed compared to that of serum calcium. The number of patient who had final serum iPTH values of <150 pg/ml, which could be associated with adynamic bone disease, did not differ in the two groups. However, the impact of the two regimens on the patients’ bone turn over was not included in the objectives of the study, so we did not obtain data associated with bone metabolism markers.

 is much less expensive than the newest sevelamer HCL and lanthanum carbonate.
The limitations of our study are: (1) it is a single-center study, although this has also a number of advantages; (2) the number of the participant patients was not large, although it is one of the largest groups reported to date; (3) the allocation of the patients to the two regimens was only partially random; (4) the relatively low starting serum phosphate level in conjunction with the no vitamin D use means that the patients were not typical of most HD patients; (5) we did not obtain data on the patients’ bone metabolism markers.
