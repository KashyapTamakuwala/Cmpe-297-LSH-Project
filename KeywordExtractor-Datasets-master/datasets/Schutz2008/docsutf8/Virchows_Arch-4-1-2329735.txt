 < 0.05). These findings suggested that MT carcinomas were also indicated to be more aggressive than IT and DT carcinomas. Significant differences were observed in the proliferation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, mucin secretion, and cell adhesion between IT and DT carcinomas, whereas only a few of these characteristics showed differences between the MT intestinal and diffuse parts, thus suggesting that both the MT components might originate from the stem cells with similar genetic traits, but follow different histogenic pathways.

]. Therefore, the analysis of distinct MT carcinoma components can be of remarkable pathogenic significance if it would be true that carcinoma cells originate from BMDCs. In the present study, 814 cases of gastric carcinomas were collected to further clarify the pathological characteristics of MT carcinoma and the gastric carcinogenesis pathways using a combination of tissue microarray (TMA) and immunohistochemical techniques.

Materials and methods
Subjects
A total of 814 gastric carcinomas were collected from surgical resection in Kouseiren Takaoka Hospital between 1998 and 2006. The patients with carcinomas included 573 men and 241 women (29–91 years, mean = 65.7 years). Among them, 312 cases were demonstrated with lymph node metastasis and 24 with liver metastasis. None of these cases underwent either chemotherapy or radiotherapy before surgery. All patients gave their informed consent for the use of tumor tissue specimens for clinical research and the University Ethical Committee approved the research protocol. All patients were followed up by consulting their case documents and through telephone interviews.

]. Briefly, group I showed a combination of two components with diffuse distribution. Group II displayed both components with the border clearly visible. Group III represented some signet cells in the intestinal and diffuse components. Group IV were mucinous carcinomas with signet cells. Group V exhibited separately intestinal and diffuse components in the gastric wall. In addition, the depth of invasion, lymphatic and venous invasion, and peritoneal dissemination were all determined.

]. This discrepancy might be due to the differences in diagnosis criteria, geographical regions, human races, living habits, and so forth. The age and sex distribution of the patients with MT carcinoma was intermediate although IT carcinomas frequently occurred in old men, compared with DT carcinomas.

]. These findings suggest that the pathobiological characteristics of the MT carcinomas were more aggressive than the other two types, which accounted for their comparatively poor prognosis observed in the present study although there was no statistical significance. Among the MT carcinomas, five groups were classified according to their growth pattern. Half of the present cases belonged to group I, which means there was diffuse distribution of the intestinal and diffuse component without clear borders in most of the MT cases. In general, groups III and IV of MT carcinomas did not exhibit deep invasion, comparatively high staging or frequent spreading, compared with other types. However, group IV of carcinomas with mucin and signet cells was more advanced with wide spreading, including local vessels and lymph node metastasis. Therefore, surgeons should carefully treat the patients with MT carcinomas in clinical practice because of their aggressive characteristics and poor prognosis, especially those classified as group IV. Furthermore, it was found that the major component in the MT primary foci morphologically paralleled to that in the corresponding lymph node metastasis although the converse situation also appeared. This inconsistent phenomenon could be explained by sampling bias or the metastatic potential of individual carcinoma cells.

]. These data suggested that there were significant differences in the proliferation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, mucin production, and cell adhesion between the IT and DT carcinomas and these molecules mechanistically contributed to the molecular distinction in the morphological, behavioral, and histogenic aspects between both types of gastric carcinomas.

]. It was proposed that MT carcinomas biologically displayed more aggressive behaviors than other types, including decreased cell adhesion, increased proliferation, and angiogenesis.

]. However, this study demonstrated that there was no significance between the MT and DT carcinoma patients' survival rates although the former was lower than the latter. Additionally, both survival rates were lower than that with IT carcinomas. To avoid sampling bias from a shorter follow-up time, the older cases were chosen for the survival analysis, but they yielded consistent results. Furthermore, Cox's hazard proportional analysis indicated that the invasive depth, venous invasion, lymph node, peritoneal or liver metastasis, and Lauren's classification were independent prognostic factors for gastric carcinomas.
In summary, IT carcinoma, which is positively correlated with favorable prognosis, frequently displayed high levels of proliferation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, mucin production, and cell adhesion. Gastric MT carcinoma showed more aggressive behaviors than IT and DT ones. There was a significant difference in the proliferation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, mucin secretion, and cell adhesion between the IT and DT carcinomas, whereas only a few characteristics were differentially detected in the intestinal and diffuse component of the mixed-type carcinoma, suggesting that different components of MT carcinoma might originate from common stem cells, but follow distinct histogenic pathways. Furthermore, these results confirm that Lauren's classification is significant regarding the histopathogenesis and differentiation and considered as a guide to the clinical treatment of gastric carcinoma.
