-cells, (NFAT) proteins, is emerging as a ubiquitous mechanism for the control of important physiological processes. Of the five mammalian NFAT isoforms, transcriptional activities of NFATs 1-4 are stimulated by a calcium driven association between the ubiquitous phosphatase calcineurin and the calcium-sensing protein calmodulin. Published in vitro evidence has suggested that other members of the calmodulin super-family, in particular the neuronal calcium sensor (NCS) proteins, can similarly modulate calcineurin activity. In this study we have assessed the ability of NCS proteins to interact directly with calcineurin in vitro and report a specific if weak association between various NCS proteins and the phosphatase. In an extension to these analyses we have also examined the effects of over-expression of NCS-1 or NCS-1 mutants on calcineurin signalling in HeLa cells in experiments examining the dephosphorylation of an NFAT-GFP reporter construct as a readout of calcineurin activity. Results from these experiments indicate that NCS-1 was not able to detectably modulate calcineurin/NFAT signalling in a live mammalian cell system, findings that are consistent with the idea that calmodulin and not NCS-1 or other NCS family proteins is the physiologically relevant modulator of calcineurin activity.

The possibility exists however that overlap between CaM and NCS target specificities may be of physiological significance and in the case of CN, identification of a functionally relevant interaction with NCS proteins would be of great interest in view of recent findings implicating CN activity in aspects of neuronal function.

We therefore suggest that NCS proteins, although exhibiting a detectable in vitro affinity for CN, may not be likely to act as physiologically relevant modulators of CN activity or NFAT mediated gene transcription in intact cells.

 binding buffer) were then added to immobilised GST proteins in a 100 μl total binding reaction volume and samples incubated with constant agitation for 2 hrs at 4 °C. GST cellulose beads were pelleted by centrifugation (5,000 rpm/1 min/4 °C) and washed with 1 ml of the appropriate binding buffer. This wash step was repeated three times and final bead pellets extracted into 50 μl SDS dissociation buffer (125 mM HEPES pH (6.8), 10% (v/v) sucrose, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 4% (w/v) SDS, 1% β-mercaptoethanol, 2 mM EDTA) and boiling for 5 min. Samples were resolved on SDS-PAGE (12.5% gel) and transferred to nitrocellulose filters for western blotting by transverse electrophoresis. Bound calcineurin was detected using a monoclonal antibody (1:1000, Sigma) followed by incubation with anti-mouse-HRP (1:400, Sigma) and visualisation with ECL reagents. All western blots were quantitated using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health) densitometry software.

2.4
Sulfo-SBED cross-linking experiments
The manufacturers protocol provided by Pierce (Rockford, IL, USA) was followed with minor modifications. All steps, except those indicated, were carried out in the dark. Bait recombinant protein of interest (∼5 mg) was dialysed against binding buffer overnight at 4 °C. Immediately before use, the contents of one tube of No-Weigh Sulfo-SBED (Pierce) was dissolved in 22 μl of DMSO, this was then added to 1 ml of dialysed protein. Sulfo-SBED/protein mixes were incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes, centrifuged briefly to remove any precipitated, hydrolysed, Sulfo-SBED, and dialysed overnight against binding buffer. Bovine brain cytosol (500 μl, ∼4 mg protein) dialysed against binding buffer was added to 500μl of the Sulfo-SBED/protein mix. This mixture was incubated on a rotator at room temperature for 1 hour. After this step, samples were exposed to long-wave UV illumination (365 nm) at a distance of ∼5 cm from source for 15 minutes. During this step an appropriate volume of Neutravidin beads (Pierce) were washed extensively in binding buffer, 100 μl added to the bait/cytosol mixture and samples incubated on a rotator for 1 hour at room temperature. Bait/cytosol mixes were then centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 1 minute, supernatants removed and beads washed with 1 ml of binding buffer. This step was repeated 6 times. Disulfide bond reduction was then achieved by incubating with 1 ml of 50 mM DTT for 1 hour at room temperature. Beads were subsequently centrifuged and washed extensively with binding buffer. After the final wash, 100 μl of SDS dissociation buffer was added to the beads and samples boiled for 10 minutes. Samples were separated on SDS PAGE (12.5% gel) and western blotted with a monoclonal anti-calcineurin antibody (1:1000, Sigma) followed by detection with anti-mouse-HRP (1:400, Sigma) and ECL reagents.

Transfection mixtures comprised 3 μl Fugene™ (Roche, UK) per 1 μg plasmid DNA in a 100 μl total volume of DMEM and were incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes prior to being added drop-wise to cells. Cells were assayed 24-48 hrs post-transfection. The NFAT-GFP reporter construct was a kind gift from Professor Anjana Rao (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA).

 1.2 mM). Cells were subsequently incubated in 500 μl Krebs containing 3 μM ionomycin or 100 μM histamine for required times before either solubilisation in SDS dissociation buffer, to investigate the phosphorylation state of NFAT via Western blotting, or fixing in 4% formaldehyde to observe the resulting sub-cellular localisation of NFAT post-treatment via confocal microscopy. For western blotting all samples were resolved on SDS-PAGE (12.5% gel) and proteins transferred to nitrocellulose filters by transverse electrophoresis. Filters were probed with monoclonal anti-GFP (1:1000, JL-8 clone, Invitrogen) followed by incubation with anti-mouse-HRP (1:400, Sigma) and protein visualised with ECL reagents.

2.7
Confocal microscopy
For confocal laser scanning microscopy, transfected cells were examined with either a Leica TCS-SP-MP microscope or a Leica TCS-SP2-AOBS microscope (Leica Microsystems, Heidelberg, Germany) using a 22 μm pinhole and a 63× water immersion objective with a 1.2 numerical aperture. EGFP was imaged using excitation at 488 nm and light collection at 500-550 nm.

For all constructs tested NFAT dephosphorylation was clearly apparent by the 5 minute time point (a 25 minute time point was also included to demonstrate complete dephosphorylation of NFAT-GFP) as determined by gel shift of the NFAT-GFP. Analysis of these earlier time points indicated there was no discernable difference in the pattern of dephosphorylation between any of the NCS-1 constructs tested and control transfected cells.

. With specific regard to possible CN/NFAT activation by NCS-1, this possibility is intriguing in light of data identifying NFAT dependent gene expression as important to aspects of neuronal cell function. Thirdly, the possibility also exists that interactions observed between NCS proteins and CaM targets are physiologically irrelevant in cells. In this study we have attempted to resolve these issues through an investigation of firstly the biochemical characteristics of NCS protein interactions with CN, and secondly by examining the potential consequences of NCS protein function on activation of the classical CaM-CN-NFAT pathway in mammalian cells.

) were similarly without effect in analyses of NFAT-GFP dephosphorylation (data not shown). From these analyses we cannot formally exclude the possibility that NCS family proteins may activate a pool of cellular CN that does not signal via NFAT dephosphorylation. This seems unlikely however taking into account our biochemical data and the fact that in numerous other studies assessing diverse triggers of CN activity, concomitant activation of the NFAT pathway is always detected.

. It is impossible to formally rule out direct modulation of CN by NCS proteins under all physiological conditions based on the data presented in this study however we have provided data to challenge the idea that CN is a cellular target of the NCS protein family and instead that CaM appears the more likely regulator of this key signalling phosphatase.

 for 7 mins (ionomycin) NFAT-GFP fluorescence was observed to translocate from the cytosol to cell nuclei for all transfected constructs analysed, consistent with dephosphorylation of the protein observed in parallel western blot studies (a). Scale bars 10 μm. (c) Western blot of total HeLa cell lysates with an anti-NCS-1 antiserum. Cells transfected identically to those used in functional assays (a and b) were lysed and subjected to western blotting to determine relative over-expression levels of the NCS-1 proteins analysed in this part of the study. Essentially equivalent levels of expression were detected for NCS-1, NCS-1G2A and NCS-1E120Q constructs. No NCS-1 signal was detectable in control empty vector transfected samples (pcDNA).
