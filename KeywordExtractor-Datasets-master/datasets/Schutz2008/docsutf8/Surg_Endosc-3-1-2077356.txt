Background
Few studies are available comparing open with laparoscopic treatment of Hirschsprung’s disease. This study compares a laparoscopic series of 30 patients with a historical open series of 25 patients.

Methods
The charts of all patients having had a Duhamel procedure in the period from June 1987 through July 2003 were retrospectively reviewed. Open procedures were performed until March 1994. Patients with extended aganglionosis, pre-Duhamel ostomy, or syndrome were excluded from the study. End points were intraoperative complications, postoperative complications, time to first feeding, hospital stay, and outcome at follow-up such as stenosis, enterocolitis, constipation, fecal incontinence, and enuresis.

Results
Twenty-five patients had an open Duhamel (OD) and 30 had a laparoscopic one (LD). There were no differences in patient characteristics and there were no intraoperative complications in either group. Time to first oral feeds was significantly longer in the OD group as was the duration of hospital stay. No significant differences at follow-up were observed but there was a tendency for a higher enterocolitis rate in the LD group. In contrast, the adhesive obstruction and enuresis rates were higher in the OD group. Cosmetic results were superior in the LD group.

Conclusions
Except for a significantly shorter hospital stay and shorter time to first oral feeds in favor of LD, no significant differences could be observed. The cosmetic result was not an end point but there was no doubt that it was better in the LD group. Although not statistically significant different, there were no adhesive bowel obstructions in the LD group compared with 3 of 25 in the OD group. Fecal incontinence was not encountered in either group.

]. There is little doubt that the laparoscopic variant of the open Duhamel leads to less pain, a quicker recovery, and better cosmesis, but the question arises whether the operation is as safe as the open one and whether the functional results are comparable. In this study we compare a series of laparoscopic Duhamel procedures with a historical series of open Duhamel procedures.
Materials and methods
The charts of all patients who underwent a Duhamel procedure in the period from June 1987 through July 2003 were retrospectively analyzed. From June 1987 through March 1994 the Duhamel procedure was performed in an open way (OD), and from March 1994 through July 2003 it was performed laparoscopically (LD).
To obtain a relatively homogeneous group of patients, patients were excluded from the study for the following reasons: preoperative colostomy, extended aganglionosis, trisomy 21, Waardenburg syndrome, or other associated malformations.

]. The technique was therefore modified. The anterior dissection was limited to just below the peritoneal reflexion, while posterior dissection was done up to the pelvic floor. Dissection of the bowel in the proximal direction was close to the bowel wall up to a good location for a biopsy. Either the rectum was amputated at the level of the peritoneal reflexion after placing a proximal ligature around the rectum to prevent leakage or the mobilized colon was everted through the anus. The everted rectum was then transected under traction close to the anus, while the bowel was further exteriorized up to the good biopsy location. The everted bowel was then amputated and closed. The everted bowel was reintroduced into the abdomen as was the remaining rectum.
About 0.5 cm above the dentate line a transverse incision was made in the posterior rectal wall and the retrorectal space was entered to meet the space dissected from above. The proximal end of the bowel was grasped, pulled through, and anastomosed circumferentially with the created opening in the posterior rectum. A side-to-side anastomosis was then made between the anterior aganglionic rectum and the posterior pulled-through ganglionic bowel using an EndoGIA (blue cartridge 3.5cm long; Tyco Heathcare) under laparoscopic control. Usually two cartridges needed to be fired. Finally, the upper rectum was closed laparoscopically with a running 2 × 0 Vicryl suture. Outcome measures included postoperative complications, hospital stay, and long-term outcome such as constipation, enterocolitis, fecal incontinence, enuresis, stenosis, and adhesive obstruction.

Because of the study design the period of follow-up is different between the two groups. Two patients in the LD group were readmitted for dilatation of the anorectum for stenosis. In one of these patients a rectal spur needed to be transected; this was performed under laparoscopic control. In this patient initially only one cartridge had been used. Reoperation was carried out in one OD patient and in two LD patients.

Discussion
Hirschsprung’s disease is basically incurable. Even when the proximal transection plane of the bowel shows a normal plexus at pathologic examination, there is no guarantee of a good outcome because the distal rectum is and remains abnormal. The best that surgery can achieve is a delicate balance between constipation and incontinence. More often than not the balance tips in one direction. End points are difficult to set and final results are therefore difficult to evaluate.

]. Although not statistically different, adhesive bowel obstruction was seen in the OD group only and the same applies for enuresis. The cosmetic results were definitely better in the LD group.

Conclusion
The laparoscopic variant of the Duhamel procedure is not simple, as reflected by its long operation time. There seems to be no essential difference between the open and the laparoscopic procedure with respect to postoperative complications or functional results at follow-up. Although there is a tendency for a higher enterocolitis rate in the LD group, lower adhesive obstruction and enuresis rates were encountered. There is no doubt that the LD is cosmetically superior. Despite the fact that the transanal approach is becoming more popular in recent years, there certainly remains a place for the laparoscopic Duhamel–Martin procedure, particularly when extended Hirschsprung’s disease is present.
