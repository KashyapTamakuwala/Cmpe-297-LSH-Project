The pattern of responses to all three assessment techniques was remarkably similar, with maximal sexual interest demonstrated and reported for adolescent and adult females. Both self-report procedures could significantly distinguish those adolescents who assaulted a child from those who assaulted peers or adults. The self-report procedures could also significantly discriminate those adolescents with male child victims. The Affinity VT approach significantly differentiated those adolescents who assaulted male children from those who assaulted other individuals. No assessment technique could accurately identify those adolescents with exclusively female child victims. Overall, the results suggest that structured, self-report data regarding sexual interests can be useful in the assessment of adolescents who have offended sexually.

 for the following adolescent clients: (i) older teenage males, (ii) individuals who acknowledge their sexual assaults, and (iii) those who offend sexually against males.
Given the scientific and ethical concerns regarding phallometric assessment, a number of researchers and clinicians have begun to use an alternative physiological measure: unobtrusively measured viewing time (VT). With this procedure, clients are asked to rate the sexual attractiveness of photographs of a variety of models while the response time to provide the ratings is unobtrusively recorded. The assumption underlying this technique is that people will look longer at stimuli that they find sexually attractive relative to stimuli that they find sexually unattractive. In several VT assessment systems that are commercially available, the models in the photographs are clothed and are not displayed in sexual poses. For many clinicians, therefore, the VT assessment addresses some of the ethical concerns raised by the PPG.

Sixty-seven percent (52/78) of the adolescents committed a sexual offense against at least one child (defined as under the age of 12 and 4 or more years younger than that adolescent at the time of the offense); the remainder (33% or 26/78) of the adolescents committed sexual assaults against peers or adults exclusively (5 of these 26 offended against male peers). With respect to the participants' ethnic origin, 81% (63/78) were Caucasian, 12% were African American/Canadian, 5% (4/78) were native American/Canadian, and 2% (2/78) were Hispanic. Information regarding intellectual functioning was available for 52 of the 78 adolescents: 19% (10/52) of these adolescents had IQ's less than 80, 6% (3/52) of the adolescents had IQ's above 120, and 75% (39/52) had an IQ's within the average range (i.e., IQ between 80 and 120). Assessors reported that 50% (39/78) of the participants disclosed a childhood sexual victimization history and 42% (33/78) of the adolescents disclosed physical abuse within their families.

Self-Report Sexual Arousal Graphs
To collect self-reported sexual arousal data, adolescents were asked to complete 2 graphs (1 graph for each gender) on which they rated their sexual arousal for 8 age-based categories: 0–3 years, 4–6 years, 7–9 years, 10–12 years, 13–15 years, 16–18 years, 18–24 years, and over 24 years (see Appendix A for self-report arousal graphs and instructions). Adolescents were first asked to rate their level of sexual arousal to the various age groups if there was no physical force or violence involved in the sexual interaction; they were then asked to use a different color of pen and indicate how their sexual arousal would change for each age group when the thought of forced sexual contact was introduced. All ratings were made on a scale from 0 (low) to 10 (high). For all participants, the graph to address sexual arousal to males was completed first, followed by the graph to capture sexual arousal to females. The graphing procedure was completed with the adolescents by a psychologist or social worker during the completion of a comprehensive assessment. There were 7 different clinicians (1 in Minnesota and 6 in Ontario) at the various agencies who assisted the adolescents to complete the graphs.

Average Sexual Arousal Scores
As a result of the fact that the Affinity program uses four age groups (toddler, preadolescent, adolescent, and adult) for each gender, the eight age groups examined using the self-report graphing procedure were collapsed to approximate the same four Affinity groups to facilitate raw-score comparisons. Specifically, self-report sexual arousal graph data were collapsed as follows: ages 0–3 and 4–6 (toddler); ages 7–9 and 10–12 (preadolescent); 13–15 and 16–18 (adolescent); 18–24 and 24 and over (adult).

Although the Affinity self-report is based on photographs of various models, and the self-report sexual arousal graphs simply require a rating in response to a numeric age group, the correlations between these two measures of sexual arousal were significant for all 8 stimulus categories. The correlations between OTL and the self-report graphs were also significant for 6 of the 8 stimulus categories.

 An Affinity Self-Report deviance index was calculated using the same mathematical procedure: the highest mean Affinity self-report rating for male or female toddlers or preschoolers was divided by the highest mean self-report rating for male or female adolescents or adults. Finally, a deviance index was calculated in the same fashion for the self-report graphing procedure by dividing the highest rating for a male or female child aged 0 to 12 by the highest rating for a male or female aged 13 and over.

Discussion
Adolescent sexual interest was assessed using three different assessment procedures: the Affinity (version 1.0) VT procedure, the Affinity self-report procedure, and a self-report sexual arousal graphing procedure. Overall, the internal consistency estimates for all three measures were acceptable for most age and gender groups, and all three assessment approaches significantly differentiated those adolescents with male child victims from those adolescents who never offended sexually against a male child. On the other hand, none of the assessment techniques could successfully differentiate adolescents with female child victims from those who offended sexually against other groups.
1989
1994
2001
2000
). As has been noted by many of these researchers, it is quite likely, therefore, that many adolescents who commit a sexual offense against a male child are motivated, at least in part, by a sexual interest in prepubescent children. Of course, not all adolescents who target male children demonstrate deviant sexual arousal, and other factors, such as opportunity or antisocial attitudes, for example, need to be considered in the etiology and/or maintenance of their sexual offenses.
2000
2002
). As has been noted by others, this may be a result of the fact that the various assessment procedures are not yet able to discern such a sexual interest. Alternatively, given the fact that this finding has been observed with both adults and adolescents—using PPG, VT, and self-report—it is possible that there are many males who commit sexual offenses against prepubescent girls for reasons other than deviant sexual interest. As noted with respect to some of those who offend against boys, it could be that factors such as opportunity or abuse-supportive attitudes, for example, are critical in the formation and/or continuation of offending behaviors.
2004
2004
), this suggests that VT alone should not be used to classify adolescents who have offended sexually with respect to victim age. Of course, despite the fact that both of the self-report procedures significantly differentiated adolescents with versus without child victims, no one assessment methodology produced an AUC over .74 regardless of the discrimination examined, and no combinatory deviance score produced an AUC over .79. This indicates that there is certainly much room for improvement, and that neither self-report procedure should be used on its own, or in combination, to determine whether or not an adolescent has committed a sexual offense against a person from a specific age/gender category. Of course, it is also possible that researchers will never find that they can get better discrimination between subgroups on the basis of victim gender and/or age because of the fact that sexual interests and attitudes are still being formed during adolescence. Although victim gender and/or age may be proxy markers of sexual interest for some adults who offend sexually, particularly those who offend against boys, it is likely that the choice of victim is less often related to fixed sexual interests for adolescents.
1992
) found that the PPG was not useful with this group as most of these adolescents were classified as “nonresponders.” There were also no female participants included in this study. Given the relative ease with which both Affinity and the self-report graphing procedures can be carried out with both male and female adolescents, it would be beneficial to learn about the psychometric properties of these assessment techniques with female participants. It would also have been ideal to have included a group of adolescents without a history of sexual offending. This would have permitted analyses regarding normative responses for both VT and self-report, and there may have been greater discrimination accuracy for specific subgroups if nonoffending youth were included. Finally, it should also be pointed out that there were only 78 participants in this investigation; therefore, the probability of a Type 1 error should be considered given the number of statistical tests herein.
r
all
 age/gender categories.
Most of the adolescents found that participating in the Affinity VT assessment was not very upsetting, and many even found the process to be at least somewhat enjoyable. Given the potential intrusiveness of the PPG procedure, it is interesting that researchers have never collected information from adolescents regarding their experience of providing PPG data. Given the current scientific limitations of the PPG with adolescents, and the ethical concerns involved in conducting such an assessment, it is encouraging that at least one VT approach (Affinity 1.0) can produce some useful information regarding sexual interests without significant negative impact. Furthermore, it is important to point out that age at time of assessment, childhood sexual victimization history, and physical abuse history were not significantly related to deviance indices calculated for Affinity VT, Affinity Self-Report, or the self-report graphing procedure. Recall that some researchers have found that PPG data are correlated with these factors.
2003
), there are no published data regarding the efficacy of this approach for adolescents. In addition to the continued refinement of measurement strategies, therefore, it is critical that we examine the impact of treatment and management techniques for those adolescents who evidence deviant sexual interests.

Appendix A: Self-Report Sexual Arousal Graphs and Instructions


Self-Report Sexual Arousal Graphs: Instructions
This is a special graph to help us look at the kinds of things that you would find sexually arousing; that is, things that would turn you on in a sexual way. Everyone is different regarding what kinds of things turn them on and turn them off, and it is important to go through this slowly. It is also really important that you are as honest as possible.


(point to the first graph) “You see that this graph has a scale from 0 to 10. Zero means that you would not be sexually aroused at all—that you would not find a person in that category sexually attractive at all. You might even think that it would be gross or disgusting. A ten means that you would be really sexually aroused or turned on sexually. A five would mean that you would be somewhat turned on sexually, and so on. Down on the bottom are males [females] of different age groups. Now the first group of ratings we are going to make are ratings of how turned on you would be doing sexual things with males [females] without the use of force—i.e., not pushing, or hitting, and no other violence; just doing sexual things and the person would go along with you.”
interviewee takes pen
 and colors in the “No Force” legend with the colored pen). “Now, with that same color, show me by putting a mark on this graph how sexually aroused you would be doing sexual things with a male aged 0-3, so that would be boys who are newborn, and 1, 2, and 3 years old. Remember, everyone is different regarding what kinds of people turn them on. Now, what about your sexual arousal to males aged 4-6?” Continue through the age groups slowly. When it comes to the “other” category, this is when one can ask about arousal to family members or other specific sexual targets that you want to question (e.g., animals).
“Now, choose a different color and color in the ‘Force’ box. Now we are going to rate how sexually turned on or aroused you would be if you used force to do sexual things with people. By ‘force,’ I mean holding someone down or hitting them and making them do sexual things when they don't want to. Everyone is different, and some people are more sexually turned on when they think of using force and some people are more turned off. For others it doesn't really change how turned on they would be. How does the use of force change how sexually turned on you would be doing sexual things with a male aged 0 to 3?” Then proceed through other age groups.
This whole procedure is then repeated with the graph for the second gender.
