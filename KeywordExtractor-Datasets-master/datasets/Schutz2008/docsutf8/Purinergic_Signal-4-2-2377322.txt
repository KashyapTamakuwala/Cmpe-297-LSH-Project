 from active skeletal muscle. Subsequent application of the identification procedures to exercising human muscle in vivo, cardiac muscle cells in vitro, and human erythrocytes exposed to hypoxia gave rise to the general concept of ATP as a molecule that could influence cell function from the extracellular direction. Mechanisms of ATP release from cells in terms of “trigger” events such as mechanical distortion of the membrane, depolarization of the membrane, and exposure to hypoxia are discussed. Potential therapeutic uses of extracellular ATP in cancer therapy, radiation therapy, and a possible influence upon aging are discussed. Possible roles (distant and local) of extracellular ATP released from muscle during whole body exercise are discussed.

It was evident that for successful measurement of acetylcholine, the identification of the interfering substance, and its removal from the solution, had to be achieved. At this stage the basic question became: what substance(s) released from active skeletal muscle could possibly stimulate the frog heart? A “blunderbuss” approach was adopted, by perfusing through the heart as many available substances, known to exist in muscle, to see if any of them produced the stimulatory effect. The purine monophosphates and adenosine were eliminated since they did not stimulate the heart. Electrolyte changes, including an elevated potassium level, were also ruled out. Changes in calcium levels were hardly detectable in the bathing solution.

Indirect versus direct muscle stimulation
directly
, without involvement of the neuromuscular junction in the activation process. Solutions bathing muscles stimulated directly produced the same stimulatory effect as the solutions from muscles stimulated via the motor nerve (indirect stimulation). This indicated that it was highly unlikely that the stimulatory substance had as its major source the activated motor nerve terminal.
Identification procedures
Identification of the stimulatory substance was established using three procedures: gel filtration, enzyme action of apyrase, and firefly tail luminescence.

] demonstrated that an enzyme purified from potatoes (“apyrase”) could selectively cleave the terminal phosphate of ATP. The stimulated muscle solution was incubated with apyrase, as were the stimulatory fractions from the gel filtration technique, and it was shown that the stimulatory effect was abolished, indicating that a phosphorylated compound was responsible for the stimulatory effect.

Perhaps release of ATP from heart cells and erythrocytes in response to hypoxia involves the presence of oxygen-sensitive potassium channels, the sequence of events being hypoxia, leading to inhibition of oxygen-sensitive channels, followed by membrane depolarization and ATP release. To date, these potassium channels have not been identified in heart cells or erythrocytes.
