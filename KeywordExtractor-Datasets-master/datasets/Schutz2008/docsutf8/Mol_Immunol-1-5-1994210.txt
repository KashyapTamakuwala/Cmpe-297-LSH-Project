Abstract
Aire
) has been suggested in this process. The aim of this study was to establish whether down or up-regulation of Aire leads to alterations in TRA expression and whether this is limited to thymic epithelial cells. This study also characterized whether TRAs follow Aire expression during normal development, and whether thymic microenvironment plays a role in the expression of Aire and TRAs. We did several in vivo and in vitro experiments to manipulate Aire expression and measured expression of four TRAs (Trefoil factor-3, Insulin-2, Major urinary protein-1 and Salivary protein-1) by real-time RT-PCR. Aire had an allele dose-dependent effect on TRA expression in the thymuses of mice from two strains, C57BL/6J and Balb/c, but had no effect on TRA expression in the lymph nodes. In the thymus, Aire and TRAs were both localized in the medulla and were co-expressed during normal development and involution. In the primary stromal cells as well as thymic epithelial cell line, the adenoviral over-expression of Aire resulted in an increase in TRA expression. By manipulating in vitro organ-cultures we showed that thymic microenvironment plays a dominant role in Aire expression whereas TRAs follow the same pattern. The data underline a direct role for Aire in TRA expression and suggest that modulation of Aire has a potential to control central tolerance and autoimmunity.

This study aims to further clarify whether Aire can directly regulate the TRA expression by analyzing the expression of four antigens in several experimental settings where Aire's expression has been modulated. The study aims to establish whether there is a dose-dependent correlation between the number of Aire allele copies and TRA expression level in thymic epithelial cells, and whether TRAs are co-expressed with Aire during thymic development and involution. We also studied whether the over-expression of Aire as a sole factor is sufficient to induce TRA expression and whether thymic microenvironment plays a role in the expression of Aire and TRAs.

For adenoviral infection of thymic primary culture and TEC 1C6, the cells were infected with Ad-GFP and AdAire-GFP at approximately 70% confluence. Cells were incubated in 500 μl serum-free OptiMEM (100 U/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin and 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin B) and infected with equal amounts of virus for 1 h. The infection rate was further assessed by quantitative real-time PCR analyzing intake of viral genomic DNA.

Briefly, thymic stromal cells from E17.5 C57BL/6 mice were prepared by disaggregating fetal thymic lobes, which had been previously cultured for 7 days in 1.45 mM deoxyguanosine (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) using 1× trypsin (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY). Reaggregates were formed by mixing together stromal cells and thymocytes at a 3:1 cell ratio and cultured for 3 days at 37 °C.

 antigens was limited to the mTEC population, i.e. the cell population of Aire expression. The cTEC population showed a very low expression for all four TRAs both in the WT as well as Aire KO mouse. Collectively these data show that Aire dose-dependently regulates TRA expression in thymus but not in the lymph nodes, and confirms by real-time PCR the previously published microarray data, suggesting that both Aire and TRAs are predominantly expressed in thymus medullary epithelium.

3.2
TRAs follow the expression of Aire during normal development and involution
Fig. 4
). Very low Aire expression was detectable already at day E13.5 but showed a significant increase at E15.5. Thus, the start of Aire expression coincides with the influx of the first wave of the hematopoietic cells to the thymus. We observed the highest expression level at postnatal D11 and a gradual decrease thereafter until the very last time-point studied. Aire expression was, however, clearly present even in 12-month-old mice. The expression of TRAs closely followed the pattern of Aire reaching their peak at D11 followed by an obvious decrease, suggesting a role for Aire in their regulation.

3.3
Over-expression of Aire results in an increase in TRA expression

, the disaggregation of thymus to 2D culture resulted in a dramatic decrease in expression of Aire as well as most of the TRAs. This effect was, at least partly, reversed by reaggregation suggesting a critical role for the thymic microenvironment in Aire as well as TRA expression.

). Here we report that, although Aire as well as Ins2 expression is clearly present in the lymph nodes of WT mice, the lack of Aire does not lead to a decrease in Ins2 expression in the Aire KO mice. The data suggests that, unlike in the thymus, other Aire-independent factors are likely to control Ins2 expression in the lymph nodes. Regarding the rest of the TRAs studied, we found very low, if any, expression by real-time PCR, which did not allow us to quantify the changes.
Sousa Cardoso et al., 2006
Gray et al., 2006
).
Aire dependent TRA expression is further illustrated by adenoviral experiments enforcing Aire expression in thymic epithelial cells. We show that over-expression of Aire as a single factor is sufficient to induce the expression of all four TRAs studied, providing evidence that modulation of Aire can directly lead to alterations in TRA levels and may thus also affect the maintenance of central tolerance. The finding that Aire, in addition to primary thymic stromal cells, can also modulate TRA levels in the thymic medullary epithelial cell line, suggests that there is no need for other cell types for the Aire-induced up-regulation of TRAs to occur.

In conclusion, we show that Aire has a dose-dependent effect on TRA expression in thymus but not in the lymph nodes. Both, Aire as well as TRAs localize in the thymic medulla and are co-expressed during normal development and involution. We also show that Aire can directly induce TRA expression in medullary epithelial cells although the thymic microenvironment plays a crucial role for the maximal expression to occur. Our data suggest a clear correlation between the expression of Aire and TRAs and indicate that approaches to stimulate Aire expression in thymic epithelium could be considered to modulate tolerance induction to peripheral antigens.

Fig. 1
Dose-dependent effect of Aire on TRA expression in C57Bl/6 and Balb/c mice. Four to six weeks old C57Bl/6 or Balb/c mice were genotyped by PCR (A) and whole thymuses from WT, Aire HET and Aire KO mice were analyzed for TRA gene expression by real-time PCR. TRA expression followed the expression of Aire in a dose-dependent manner in C57Bl/6 (B) as well as Balb/c (C) mice. Data are mean with S.E.M. of triplicate measurements of one out of two representative experiments.



Fig. 2
Expression of Ins2 in the lymph nodes of WT vs. Aire KO. Thymuses or inguinal lymph nodes were collected from 4- to 6-week-old mice and analyzed for Aire or Ins2 gene expression by real-time PCR. Aire expression relative to the epithelial marker, K8, was higher in the lymph nodes compared to the whole thymus of WT mice (A). The expression of Ins2 was unaffected in the Aire KO mice compared to the WT mice (B). Data are mean with S.E.M. of triplicate measurements of one out of two representative experiments.



Fig. 3
TRA expression in mTEC vs. cTEC populations of WT and Aire KO mice. Thymuses were stained with anti-EpCAM and anti-Aire antibodies and analyzed by immunofluorescent microscopy (A) or were enzyme digested and FACS-sorted according to the expression of EpCAM and analyzed for the expression level of TRAs by real-time PCR (B). Medullary compartment of thymus was distinctly characterized by high-EpCAM expression and by the presence of Aire-positive cells. TRAs were highly expressed in the thymic medulla but not in cortex of the WT mice. Aire KO mice showed virtually no expression of TRAs either in medulla or cortex. Data in (B) are mean with S.E.M. of triplicate measurements of one out of two representative experiments.



Fig. 4
Aire and TRA expression during development. Thymuses were collected from normal WT mice at indicated time-points and the gene expression level analyzed by real-time PCR. Aire expression, as well as the expression of most of the ectopic genes reached their peak at D11 after birth followed by a gradual decrease. Data are mean with S.E.M. of triplicate measurements of one out of two representative experiments. Dotted line corresponds to polynomial estimation.



Fig. 5
Over-expression of Aire induces TRA expression in primary thymic stromal cells and in thymic epithelial cell line. Infection with AdAire-GFP (as described in the methods) caused an induction of Aire protein (A). Monolayers of primary thymic stromal cells (B) or thymic epithelial cell-line TEC 1C6 (C) were infected with equal amounts of Ad-GFP or AdAire-GFP and, 48 h later, the cells were harvested for RNA purification and real-time PCR. Aire over-expression resulted in increased TRA expression in both cell types. Data are mean with S.E.M. of triplicate measurements of one out of two representative experiment.



Fig. 6
Requirement of thymic microenivironment for Aire and TRA expression. Thymuses from E17.5 old embryos of C57BL/6 mice were collected and either left intact (3D lobes), disaggregated (3D > 2D) or disaggregated and re-aggregated (RTOC) as described in the methods. Disaggregation resulted in down-regulation of Aire and TRA expression. This effect was restored by reaggregation. Data are mean with S.E.M. of triplicate measurements of one out of two representative experiment.
