Extracellular nucleotides play an important role in lung defense, but the release mechanism and relative abundance of different nucleotide species secreted by lung epithelia are not well defined. In this study, to minimize cell surface hydrolysis, we used a low-volume, flow-through chamber and examined adenosine and uridine nucleotide concentrations in perfusate aliquots of human lung A549 cells challenged by 50% hypotonic shock. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP), adenosine diphosphate (ADP), adenosine monophosphate (AMP), and adenosine (Ado) were quantified in high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis of fluorescent etheno derivatives, and uridine triphosphate (UTP) and uridine diphosphate (UDP) were measured using HPLC-coupled radioenzymatic assays. After the onset of hypotonic shock, ATP, ADP, UTP, and UDP in the perfusates increased markedly and peaked at approximately 2.5 min, followed by a gradual decay in the next 15–20 min; peak changes in Ado and AMP were relatively minor. The peak concentrations and fold increment (in parentheses) were: 34 ± 13 nM ATP (5.6), 11 ± 5 nM ADP (3.7), 3.3 ± 1.2 nM AMP (1.4), 23 ± 7 nM Ado (2.1), 21 nM UTP (>7), and 11 nM UDP (27). Nucleotide release was almost completely abolished from cells loaded with the calcium chelator 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA). Under isotonic conditions, elevation of intracellular calcium with the calcium ionophore ionomycin (5 μM, 3 min) also released nucleotides with kinetics and relative abundance as above, albeit less robust. ADP:ATP (1:3) and UDP:UTP (1:2) ratios in perfusates from stimulated cells were markedly higher than the cytosolic ratios of these species, suggesting that a nucleotide diphosphate (NDP)-rich compartment, e.g., the secretory pathway, contributed to nucleotide release. Laser confocal microscopy experiments illustrated increased FM1-43 uptake into the plasma membrane upon hypotonic shock or ionomycin treatment, consistent with enhanced vesicular exocytosis under these conditions. In summary, our results strongly suggest that calcium-dependent exocytosis is responsible, at least in most part, for adenosine and uridine nucleotide release from A549 cells.

-dependent exocytosis remains incompletely explored. Such studies, however, are complicated by nucleotide hydrolysis at the airway surface, which makes it difficult to assess the magnitude and relative abundance of different nucleotide species released. Therefore, we used a flow-through chamber to minimize cell surface hydrolysis.
We found that hypotonic shock markedly increased ATP, adenosine diphosphate (ADP), uridine triphosphate (UTP), and uridine diphosphate (UDP) concentrations in perfusates, which peaked at approximately 2.5 min. Nucleotide release was almost completely abolished from cells loaded with BAPTA and, under isotonic conditions, could be evoked by elevation of intracellular calcium with the calcium ionophore ionomycin. High nucleotide diphosphate (NDP) concentrations in perfusates of stimulated cells suggested that an NDP-rich compartment, e.g., the secretory pathway, contributed to this release. Together with real-time FM1-43 fluorescence experiments, our results strongly indicate that calcium-dependent exocytosis is a major mechanism of adenosine and uridine nucleotide release from A549 cells.

Materials and methods
Cells
Human lung carcinoma A549 cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified eagles medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM L-glutamine, 56 U/ml penicillin-G and 56 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate. All constituents of the culture media were from GIBCO-BRL (Burlington, ON, Canada). ATP efflux was measured from cell monolayers grown to confluency on 24 × 60-mm glass coverslips. Fura-2 calcium imaging and FM1-43 microscopy experiments were performed on cells grown on circular 15-mm diameter no. 1 glass coverslips.

, 10 glucose and 10 HEPES, pH 7.4, adjusted with sodium hydroxide (NaOH). Fifty percent hypotonic medium was prepared by reducing the salt concentration while keeping divalent cation concentration constant. For calcium imaging, coverslips with Fura-2-loaded cells were mounted in the imaging/perfusion chamber attached to the heated platform (Warner Instruments) on the stage of an inverted microscope (Nikon TE300). The cells were exposed to alternate (200 ms) illumination at 340 nm and 380 nm with a high-pressure mercury lamp (100 W) via interference filters (Chroma Technology, Brattleboro, VT, USA) mounted on a filter wheel (Sutter Lambda 10-C, Sutter Instrument, Novato, CA, USA) and a dichroic mirror (510/540 nm, Chroma Technology). Fluorescence images were recorded at 15- to 60-s intervals with the digital camera and stored for later analysis.

Chemicals
For calcium-imaging experiments, Fura-2-AM was obtained from Molecular Probes, Invitrogen Corp. (Burlington, ON, Canada). Probenicid, Pluronic F127 and all other reagents were from Sigma Aldrich (Oakville, ON, Canada).
