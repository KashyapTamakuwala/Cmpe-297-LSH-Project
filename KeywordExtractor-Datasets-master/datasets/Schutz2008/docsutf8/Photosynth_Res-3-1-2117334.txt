 fluorescence techniques. Measurements of modulated fluorescence using a pulse amplitude modulated fluorometer revealed that the efficiency of photosystem II decreased both with increasing time of UV-B radiation and with increasing intensity of the UV-B. Fluorescence induction rise curves were analyzed using a mechanistic model of energy trapping. It appears that the damage by UV-B radiation occurs first at the acceptor side of photosystem II, and only later at the donor side.

Several different batches of plants were used and no significant difference could be detected when comparing results from experiments replicated with plants with similar ages but from different batches.

) floating on petri-dishes filled with demineralized water with the abaxial leaf surface exposed to the radiation. The control samples were either kept in the darkness or exposed to white light (PAR). In some experiments leaves were vacuum infiltrated with 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (DCMU) in 0.5% ethanol before being exposed to UV-B, with the controls infiltrated with a 0.5% ethanol solution.
UV-B irradiations were performed using a Vilber Lourmat lamp with filter (VL-115M, Marne-la-Vallée, France). This lamp has a peak emission at 312 nm. UV-B irradiance was measured with an optometer (United Detector Technology Inc, Baltimore, USA) equipped with a probe specific for UV radiation.
