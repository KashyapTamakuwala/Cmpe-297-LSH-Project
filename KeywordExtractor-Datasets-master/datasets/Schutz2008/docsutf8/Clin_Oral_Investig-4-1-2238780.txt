This conventional literature review discusses whether pathological tooth wear is age dependant. It briefly reviews the components of tooth wear and the prevalence of tooth wear in children, adolescents and adults. The emphasis on terminology relating to tooth wear varies. In some countries, the role of erosion is considered the most important, whereas others consider the process to be a combination of erosion, attrition and abrasion often with one being more dominant. The importance of tooth wear or erosion indices in the assessment and the evidence for progression within subject and within lesions is described. The data from the few studies reporting pathological levels of wear reported in children and adults are discussed, in particular its relationship with age. There is little evidence to support the concept that pathological levels of erosion or wear are age dependant. There is, however, some evidence to suggest that normal levels of erosion or wear are age dependant.

]. The aim of this paper is to consider and investigate the concept that pathological erosive tooth wear is age dependant.
There is some debate within the dental academic community on the appropriateness of terminology. Many academics recognise the term tooth wear as encompassing erosion, attrition and abrasion. However, other researchers focus upon acid erosion often using the term to describe what others would call tooth wear and use the term erosion in a context which others might not agree. Whilst the definitions of erosion, abrasion and attrition are accepted, the relative importance of these causes is not. Therefore, in this paper both terms are used where appropriate to convey meaning interpreted by many researchers working in this field.

]. From most of these studies, it is clear that in children and adolescents wear of enamel is common, almost normal, but wear of dentine exposing more than 1/3 of the tooth surface is less so.

]. They observed that only 7% of tooth surfaces showed any change over a median time of 26 months (IQR 14–50 months). The paucity of data on the severity of tooth wear in different age groups and its progression means it is difficult to be able to predict what is the pathophysiological behaviour of tooth wear.

]. There are no data to indicate if particular teeth or tooth surfaces have a greater potential to wear or whether abrasion, attrition or erosion is more important in the progression. Furthermore, correlating this rather limited data to the general population is not possible, and therefore, most researchers rely upon epidemiological studies to record the severity of wear.

Pathological tooth wear

] hypothesised that in common with other mammals, humans have compensatory mechanisms that adapt to wear of teeth. They based their argument on comparative anatomy of mammals, in particular large herbivores, and suggested that tooth wear was beneficial to the efficiency of mastication. A gradual reduction in height and shape of cusps on molar teeth, they argued, led to improved masticatory efficiency. Their hypothesis remains unique and unproven but raises a number of interesting concepts.

] reported in their study of 1,007 subjects, aged 16 and over, that within each age cohort a proportion had higher grades of tooth wear [mean 5.1%] than the others. Virtually every other study on the prevalence of tooth wear also reports that a small proportion, generally between 2% and 10%, have higher levels of tooth wear than the majority. If these data are representative of the population at large, it is possible that a percentage of each age cohort has higher than normal levels of wear and this could be termed pathological.
The hypothesis that pathological tooth wear is age related depends on who is assessing the impact. State health care authorities, private insurance schemes, industry, dentists and patients all have different interpretations on what is pathological and what is not. For patients, loss of enamel could be considered pathological particularly if they are focussed upon the appearance of their teeth, whereas dentists may consider intervention is needed when dentine is involved, but their capacity to treat is affected by the limitations of restorative materials. On the other hand, state health care providers may take a much longer term view, with the assumption that a tooth remains functional, if not aesthetic, when operative care is not imperative.
Based on the current data, it is too challenging to suggest that tooth wear is an age-related phenomenon. There is some justification to this hypothesis based on the current data from children, adolescents and adults. Clinical experience suggests that as adults age they tend to develop more wear on the occlusal and incisal surfaces of teeth. It is likely, therefore, that some progression of wear on teeth is age related. However, this assumption needs investigating. Evidence partly from prevalence studies and partly from accurate measurement of tooth wear by profilometry tends to give support to this hypothesis. It must be remembered, however, that the prevalence studies at best report on just over 1,000 subjects. This is extremely small considering the populations involved. Tooth wear indices remain the most convenient and reproducible method to grade severity but are limited by incompatible criteria. It is imperative that a consensus is developed to build a simple and reproducible index, used by researchers so that data on the prevalence of tooth wear, particularly in adults, can be investigated.

Conclusion
25
]. Therefore, small changes or evidence of gradual wear throughout life is probably a feature of the ageing of the dentition.
