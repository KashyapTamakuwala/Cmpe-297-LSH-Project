 double mutants, 7 of the 15 plants shed pollen and 8 made an ear. Barren tassels that did not shed pollen were not included in the tassel length or anthesis measurements.

Aniline blue staining
Leaf strips 1 cm in width were cut from mutant and wild-type leaves. The abaxial epidermis and the mesophyll cells directly beneath it were gently scraped away with a single-edge razor to expose the inner leaf tissues. The leaf strip was placed on a slide, briefly stained with a 0.05% aniline blue and immediately viewed using a 360–370-nm excitation filter and a 420-nm long pass emission filter on a Nikon Eclipse 80i fluorescent microscope. Epifluorescent illumination was provided by a 100-W mercury lamp, and images were recorded using a DXM1200F Nikon digital camera.

TEM analyses
1969
). Thin sections (90–100 nm) were cut on a Leica Ultracut E ultramicrotome with a glass knife and lifted onto 200-mesh copper grids. The grids were stained in 2% uranyl acetate, followed by Reynold’s lead citrate and observed with a JEOL JEM 1200 EXII at an accelerating voltage of 80 kV.

Chlorophyll quantification
Relative levels of total chlorophylls were quantified from leaves using a SPAD 502 Data Logger Chlorophyll Meter (Spectrum Technologies). For each tissue, 30 samples were measured, and the experiment was performed three times. Representative data from one replicate are shown.

Sugars and starch quantification
