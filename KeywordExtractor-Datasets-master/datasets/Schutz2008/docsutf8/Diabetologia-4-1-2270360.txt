 mutation is important because it confirms a diagnosis of MODY, classifies the subtype, predicts the likely clinical course and may change the patient’s treatment. First-degree relatives will be at 50% risk of inheriting the mutation and asymptomatic individuals may be offered predictive genetic testing (after appropriate genetic counselling) in order to provide reassurance (for those shown not to carry the mutation) or regular blood glucose monitoring with early diagnosis and appropriate treatment (for mutation carriers).

Methods
A group of European clinicians and scientists met on 22 May 2007 at a workshop to formulate best practice guidelines for molecular genetic testing in MODY. Discussions focused on clinical criteria for selection of patients for testing, methodologies, interpretation of results and reporting those results to the referring clinicians.
A draft document was posted on 24 August 2007 and an online editing tool was used by participants to produce consensus guidelines.

Several features suggesting monogenic diabetes rather than a diagnosis of young-onset type 2 diabetes should be considered: no marked obesity or evidence of insulin resistance in diabetic family members, absence of acanthosis nigricans and whether the family is from an ethnic background with a low prevalence of type 2 diabetes (e.g. of European descent).

Polymorphisms
Some laboratories include details of polymorphisms detected in the report. The reasons for doing this include: (1) making all data available to the requesting clinician based on the rationale that a polymorphism may later be reclassified as a mutation; and (2) identifying heterozygous SNPs excludes a gene deletion involving the exon(s) in question.
However, this information can cause confusion or even misinterpretation of the result (A. T. Hattersley, unpublished data) and it certainly adds to the length of the report. While in some cases there may be reports in the literature of an association with type 2 diabetes or reduced insulin secretion, these polymorphisms do not cause MODY and we recommend that they should be excluded from the report.

Conclusions
Molecular genetic testing is useful in patients with MODY because it confirms a diagnosis of monogenic diabetes, predicts likely clinical course, defines risk for relatives and determines treatment.
At the present time, molecular genetic testing for MODY is relatively expensive and phenotypic selection prior to testing is normal practice. With the development of new technologies it is likely that these costs will decrease in time and that the analysis of genes associated with monogenic diabetes may become routine for all newly diagnosed patients. In the meantime we hope that these guidelines will be useful in determining which patients should be offered testing, and in the interpretation and reporting of the test results.
