]. The main advantage of MNDO over earlier methods was that the values of the parameters were optimized to reproduce molecular rather than atomic properties. When it first appeared, MNDO was immediately popular because of its increased accuracy, but, with the passage of time, various limitations were found, among the most important of which was the almost total absence of a hydrogen bond. As hydrogen bonding is essential to life, this particular fault essentially precluded MNDO being used in modeling biochemistry.

], was made to improve MNDO by adding a stabilizing Gaussian function to the core-core interaction to represent the hydrogen bond. Despite the fact that this was an over-simplification of a very complicated phenomenon, the overall effect was similar, and for the first time NDDO methods gave a good, albeit limited, model of hydrogen bonding.

] have been developed.
Because of the way advances in NDDO developments occurred, in terms of the modifications of the approximations and the extensions to specific elements or groups of elements, there has been an inevitable lack of consistency. The aim of the current work was three-fold: to investigate the incorporation of some of the reported modifications to the core-core approximations into the NDDO methodology; to carry out a systematic global parameter optimization of all the main group elements, with emphasis on compounds of interest in biochemistry; and to extend the methodology by performing a restricted optimization of parameters for the transition metals. This resulted in the development of a new method, consisting of the final set of approximations used and the optimized parameters. This method will be referred to as parametric method number 6, or PM6. The name PM6 was chosen to avoid any confusion with two other unpublished methods, PM4 and PM5.

Theory
Despite the apparent complexity of semiempirical methods, there are only three possible sources of error: reference data may be inaccurate or inadequate, the set of approximations may include unrealistic assumptions or be too inflexible, and the parameter optimization process may be incomplete. In order for a method to be accurate, all three potential sources of error must be carefully examined, and, where faults are found, appropriate corrective action taken.

].
For molecular geometries, gas phase reference data are preferred, but in many instances such data were unavailable, and recourse was made to condensed-phase data. Provided that care was taken to exclude those species whose geometries were likely to be significantly distorted by crystal forces, or which carried a large formal charge, condensed-phase data of the type found in the CSD were regarded as being suitable as reference data.
Because earlier methods used only a limited number of reference data, most of the cases where the method gave bad results were not discovered until after the method was published. In an attempt to minimize the occurrence of such unpleasant surprises, the set of reference data used was made as large as practical. To this end, where there was a dearth or even a complete absence of experimental reference data, recourse was made to high level calculations. Thus, for the Group VIII elements, there are relatively few stable compounds, and the main phenomena of interest involve rare gas atoms colliding with other atoms or molecules, so reference data representing the mechanics of rare gas atoms colliding with other atoms was generated from the results of ab-initio calculations. Additionally, there is an almost complete lack of thermochemical data for many types of complexes involving transition metals, so augmenting what little data there was with the results of ab-initio calculations was essential.

] was used with the DZVP basis set. Within the spectrum of ab-initio methods these methods are not particularly accurate; many methods with larger basis sets and with post-Hartree-Fock corrections are more accurate. However, the methods used in this work were chosen because they were regarded as robust, practical methods, allowing many systems to be modeled in a reasonable amount of time, a condition that could not be achieved with the more sophisticated ab-initio methods.

 more than that of the B3LYP geometry.” When such a rule was included in the parameter optimization, with an appropriate large weight, any tendency of the parameters to predict the incorrect geometry resulted in a large contribution to the error function. That is, with the new rule in place, there was a strong disincentive to prediction of the incorrect structure. Usually one rule was sufficient to correct most qualitative errors, but for a few complicated structures more than one rule was needed. The commonest need for multiple rules occurred when, initially, one rule was used to correct a faulty prediction and, after re-optimizing the parameters, the geometry optimized to a new structure that was distinctly different from either the correct structure or the incorrect structure covered by the rule. When that happened, the procedure just described was repeated, and a new rule added to the set of reference data to address the new incorrect structure. In extreme cases, several such rules might be needed, each one defining a geometry that was incorrect and should therefore be avoided.

Rare gas atoms at sub-equilibrium distances

. The shape of the potential energy surface (PES) can readily be mapped using DFT methods. By selecting two or three representative points on this PES, reference data rules can be constructed that describe the mechanical properties of the interactions. As with hydrogen bonding, a large weight can be assigned to these rules.

Use of rules to restrain parameter values
In general, uncharged atoms that are separated by a distance sufficiently large so that all overlaps between orbitals on the two atoms are vanishingly small will not interact significantly, and what interaction energy exists would arise from VDW terms: of their nature, these are mildly stabilizing. Although statements of this type are obviously true, when they are expressed as rules and added to the training set of reference data they can help define the parameter values. For a pair of atoms, A and B, a simple diatomic system would be constructed in which the interatomic separation was the minimum distance at which any overlaps of the atomic orbitals would still be insignificant. The electronic state of such a system would then be the sum of the states of the two isolated atoms. Thus, if both A and B were silicon, then, since the ground state of an isolated silicon atom is a triplet, the combined state would be a quintet. Because the two atoms do not interact significantly, a rule could then be constructed that said “The energy of the diatomic system is equal to the addition of energies of the two individual systems.” By giving this rule a large weight, any tendency of the method to generate a spurious attraction or repulsion between the atoms would be prevented.

Atomic energy levels
In keeping with the philosophy that a large amount of reference data should be used in the parameter optimization, spin-free atomic energy levels were used for most elements. The exceptions were carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen, where there were enough conventional reference data that the addition of atomic energy levels would not significantly improve the definition of the parameter surface.
NDDO approximations do not allow for spin-orbit coupling. Therefore, spin-free levels were needed. For a few elements, there were insufficient spin states to allow the spin-free energy levels to be calculated. For all the remaining elements, spin-free energy levels were calculated.

. To allow for this, a corresponding change was made to the ground state configuration in the PM6 definition of tungsten.
Where there were relatively few other reference data, the singly-ionized, and, in rare cases, the doubly-ionized, spin-free states were also evaluated and used as reference data.
Each energy level contributed one reference datum to the training set. Most atoms have a large number of atomic energy levels, so in order to minimize the probability that a level might be incorrectly assigned, each level was labeled with three quantum numbers: the total spin momentum, the total angular momentum, and the principal quantum number for these two quantum numbers. These were compared with the corresponding values calculated from the state functions. Since each set of three quantum numbers is unique, the potential for miss-assignment was minimized. In rare cases, particularly during the early stages of parameter optimization, two states with the same total spin and angular quantum numbers would be interchanged, with the result that the calculated principal quantum number would also be interchanged. All such cases always involved the ground state, and were quickly identified and corrected.


Approximations
Most of the approximations used in PM6 are identical to those in AM1 and PM3. The differences are:

When PM3 parameters for elements of Groups IA were being optimized, the MNDO approximation to the core-core expression was found to be unsuitable. In these elements there is only one valence electron so the core charge is the same as that of hydrogen. A consequence of this was that the apparent size of these elements was also approximately that of a hydrogen atom, in marked contrast with observation. For these elements, diatomic core-core parameters were also found to be essential.

, this being the best compromise between the requirements that the function should have a vanishingly small value at normal chemical distances. That is, under normal conditions the value of the function should be negligible, and at small interatomic separations the function should be highly repulsive, i.e., that it should represent the unpolarizable core.

Individual core-core corrections
For a small number of diatomic interactions, the general expression for the core-core interaction was modified in order to correct a specific fault. Because it is desirable to keep the methodology as simple as possible, modifications of the approximations were made only after determining that the existing approximations were inadequate. The diatomic specific modifications were:

 were, at least to a first approximation, constant. By making this assumption the values of the parameters could then be updated using perturbation theory. Because the assumption is only valid in the region of the starting point in parameter space, periodically the focus was moved to the new point in parameter space and a complete explicit re-evaluations of all the functions performed. The parameter optimization process terminated when the scalar of the first derivatives dropped below a preset limit. This process was fully automated, and for given sets of reference data and parameters, parameter optimization could be performed rapidly, easily, and reliably.

Sequence of optimization of parameters
10
 terms. With more powerful computers, evaluating such large sets of derivatives might be practical some day, but even then, one faulty reference datum or one faulty initial parameter value would ruin an optimization run. The strategy of parameter optimization was approached with great caution, and the procedure finally adopted was as follows:
Because the elements H, C, N, and O are of paramount importance in biochemistry, and because large amounts of reference data are available, the starting point for parameter optimization involved the simultaneous optimization of parameters for these four elements. For the purposes of discussion, this set of four elements will be called the “core elements”.
Once stable parameters had been obtained, parameters for other elements important in organic chemistry were optimized in two stages. First, the parameters for the core elements were held constant, and parameters for the elements F, P, S, Cl, Br, and I were optimized one at a time. Then all parameters for all ten elements were simultaneously optimized. This set (the organic elements) was then used as the starting point for parameterizing the rest of the main group.
The same sequence was followed for the rest of the main-group elements. That is, parameters for each element were optimized while freezing the parameters for the organic elements. Then, once all the elements had been processed, all parameters for all of the 39 main-group elements, plus zinc, cadmium, and mercury, were optimized simultaneously.
When parameters for the transition metals were being optimized, all parameters for the main group elements were held constant. There were several reasons for this. Most importantly, the reference data for the transition metals, particularly the thermochemical data, was of lower quality, so one consideration was to prevent the transition metals from having a deleterious effect on the main-group elements. Another important consideration was that most compounds involving transition metals also involved only elements of the organic set. Since parameters for these elements had been optimized using a training set consisting of all the main-group elements, the values of the optimized parameters would likely be relatively insensitive to the influence of the small number of additional reference data involving transition metals.
In general, all parameters for a given element were optimized simultaneously; this was both efficient and convenient. In some optimizations, specifically those involving a new element, only sub-sets of parameters were used. Three main sub-sets were used:

Parameters that determine atomic electronic properties
ss
pp
dd
sn
pn
dn
. If the heat of ionization and sufficient atomic energy level data were available, these quantities could be uniquely defined; there would be no need for the use of molecular reference data. These parameters were the first to be optimized whenever an optimization was started for an element that had not previously been parameterized

Parameters that determine molecular electronic properties
s
p
d
s
p
d
. In the second stage of parameter optimization, the first six parameters were held constant at the values defined using atomic data and the second set optimized. During this operation, all geometries were fixed at their reference values.

Parameters that determine geometries
As soon as an initial optimized set of electronic parameters was available, the diatomic and other core-core parameters could be optimized. The most efficient process was to optimize these parameters initially without allowing the electronic parameters or the molecular geometries to optimize. If geometries were allowed to optimize, optimization of the core-core parameters would be slowed considerably, because of the tight dependency of the optimized geometries on the values of the core-core parameters, and vice versa.
S
 was incremented by a constant times the square of the excess. No penalty was applied if the value of a parameter was between the pre-defined limits; that is, no bias was applied to the numerical value of a parameter. During the early stages of simultaneous optimization of all the parameters for a given element the penalty function was used frequently. In the later stages the penalty function was invoked rarely, and then only when there was a distinct shortage of reference data.

Transition metals
Optimizing parameters for transition metals was not as straightforward as for the main group elements. As with the main group compounds, there is a wealth of structural reference data on transition metal complexes. However, unlike main group compounds, there is a distinct shortage of reliable thermochemical data. To alleviate this shortage, the thermochemical data that was available was augmented by the results of DFT calculations. It was recognized, however, that these derived reference data were likely to be of a lower accuracy than the experimental data. Many transition metal complexes are also highly labile; a consequence of this was that some moieties that are known to exist in the solid phase were predicted to be unstable in the gas phase, at least at the PM6 level of calculation. In most cases, such moieties had a high formal charge, therefore, without any countercharge, their instability in isolation is understandable. When an intrinsically unstable ion was identified, it was removed from further consideration.

Sets of transition metals
For the purpose of discussion, the set of 30 transition metals can be partitioned into eight of the groups of the Periodic Table, with each group containing one or more triads of elements. A detailed discussion of each element is impractical because of the wide range of compounds in transition metal chemistry. The following section, therefore, will be limited to systems where PM6 does not work well, and to systems illustrative of the structural chemistry of specific elements.

Discussion
Methodological changes
During the development of PM6, only very minor changes were made to the set of approximations. The main change was in the construction of the training set used for parameter optimization. One of the most important changes was the use of rules in the training set to define chemical information that was not a function of any single molecule. In earlier methods the training set had included only standard reference data. Of their nature, such data could not allow for chemical facts that were independent of any one moiety. For example, the strength of a hydrogen bond is of great importance in biochemistry, but it could not be expressed in terms of a single species. By use of rules, the value of some chemical quantity could be related to that of another. In the case of hydrogen bonding, the heat of formation of the water dimer was made a function of the heat of formation of two separated water molecules.

 mentioned above, in which the only datum that was defined referred to the relative energies of the compound in two different symmetries. No reference was made to the bond lengths, or bond angles. With such a rule in place, the parameters could be re-optimized to minimize the error arising from the rule, with the effect that the energy of the incorrect symmetry increased relative to that of the correct symmetry. In the majority of cases, one rule of this type was sufficient; less frequently, two rules were used, and, in rare cases, even more rules were necessary.

 was predicted to readily move toward the central atom with the result that a Sc-H bond was formed. Such faults could easily be corrected by the addition to the training set of appropriate reference data from high-level calculations. This was done in several instances, and the specific error was corrected, but this action then also required all the testing to be re-started. Because this was a time-consuming process, when faults were found near the end of the testing phase, the decision was taken that the fault should be noted, as in the Sc-H error mentioned here, and to take no further action at that time.

 population would become very small; but if atomic energy levels were excluded, then the resulting method would not be suitable for reproducing such levels. The decision to use all available atomic energy levels in the training set was a value judgement. In the next training set, it is likely that the result of this decision-making process will be different.
Detecting faults in semiempirical methods is difficult, and rather than wait until all errors of this type were found and fixed, a process that could potentially take several more years, the decision was made to freeze the parameters at their current value. Obviously, PM6 still has many errors; some have already been described. Work has already started in an attempt to correct them.


Elimination of computational artifacts
Earlier NDDO methods, particularly PM3 and AM1, produced artifacts in potential energy surfaces as a result of unrealistic terms in the core-core approximation, specifically in the set of Gaussian functions used. In PM6, only one Gaussian-type correction to the core-core potential is allowed, and, consequently, the potential for these artifacts has been reduced. On the other hand, because PM6 uses diatomic parameters, the likelihood of readily-characterized errors involving specific pairs of atoms, e.g. Sc and H, as mentioned earlier, is increased. Errors of this type can be easily eliminated by a re-parameterization of the faulty diatomic.
There are over 450 sets of diatomic interactions parameterized in PM6, covering most of the common types of chemical bonds. But the number of potential bonds is much larger: given 70 elements, there are almost 2500 diatomic sets. If a molecule contains two elements for which the diatomic interaction parameters are missing, then, provided the elements are well separated, say by more than 4 Ångstroms, the absence of the parameters will not be important. If the two elements were near to each other, then the diatomic core-core parameters would be needed. This would involve generating a small training set of reference data that included a few examples of the type of interaction involved, and optimizing the two terms in the diatomic interaction.
This ability to add diatomic parameter sets to PM6 without modifying the underlying parameterization has the advantage that more and more types of interaction can be added without changing the essential nature of the method.

Several low-energy phenomena are predicted more accurately by PM6, with the most important of these being the prediction of the energies and geometries involved in hydrogen bonding. One consequence of this increased accuracy is that the lowest energy conformer of acetylacetone is now correctly predicted to be the ene-ol structure, and not the twisted di-one configuration.

. The performance of these methods when applied to non-equilibrium systems, in particular transition states, is likely to be very inferior to that of B3LYP or HF 6–31G*.
As a result of the current work, there is a clear strategy for further improving the accuracy of semiempirical methods. All three potential sources of error need to be addressed. Regarding reference data, considerably more data are needed than were used here. This would likely come from increased use of high-level theoretical methods: methods significantly more accurate than those used here would obviously be needed in any future work. Parameter optimization can be performed with confidence and reliability, particularly when well-behaved systems are used. In all cases examined where problems were encountered in parameter optimization, problems also occurred in the normal SCF calculation in MOPAC2007. This implies that as faults in the SCF procedure are corrected, faults in parameter optimization would also be removed.

Permanent errors
Notwithstanding the optimism just expressed, not all errors can be eliminated by better data and better optimizations. Despite strenuous efforts, some calculated quantities persistently failed to agree with the reference values. Many potential causes for these failures were investigated. In each case the weight for the offending quantity was increased considerably and the parameter optimization re-run. When that was done, the specific error decreased, but errors elsewhere increased disproportionately. Since the final gradient of the error function was acceptably small, it followed that the parameter optimization was not in error. The reference data were checked to ensure that they were in fact trustworthy. Because two of the three possible origins of error had been eliminated, the inescapable conclusion was that there is a fault in the set of approximations. The most serious of these faults was the qualitatively incorrect prediction of the geometry of the exceedingly simple system, iron pentacarbonyl.

The potential exists for further large increases in accuracy. This would likely result from the increased use of accurate reference data derived from high-level methods, and from the development of better tools for detecting errors at an early stage of method development.
