Such specific limitations indicate differential thermal adaptation among these divergent groups. They may explain currently observed migrations in mussel distributions and invasions. Our results provide a practical framework for the thermal ecophysiology of bivalves, the assessment of environmental changes due to climate change and its impact on (and consequences for) aquaculture.

). Mean habitat temperature of the shallow water and intertidal habitats showed a constant relation with SST. In summer SST was about two degrees lower than the mean values calculated from the logger data at all sites, while in winter the SST was slightly lower for the Atlantic and Mediterranean sites. For the Baltic Sea sites, winter SSTs were similar to the logger data. Using the relation between SST and logger data, we estimated the acclimatization temperature of each mussel and clam population for each sampling occasion. This acclimatization temperature is defined in this study as the mean water temperature for the period of 30 days before sampling. We assume that this is a proper indication of the temperature to which the animals should be well adjusted.

However, in the Baltic populations, outside the summer period maximum rates were observed at a lower experimental temperature. In Umeå (3), respiration rates measured in January and April declined at experimental temperatures exceeding 10–17 °C.

). The population from the Mecklenburg Bight (7) exhibited exceptionally high respiration rates for Baltic Sea mussels in the summer. In general, these high respiration rates measured at high experimental temperatures are not expected to occur in the field. When the summer starts, and peaks in habitat temperatures (24 °C+) occur in the field, the amplitude of the respiratory response at these higher temperatures declined. We propose that this modulation of metabolic thermal sensitivity is a protection mechanism that prevents excessive metabolic rates at high ambient temperatures. At the northern Baltic Sea station (3), the high thermal sensitivity of the metabolic rate did not result in high respiration rates in wintertime (which includes April in this area). Rates declined above 10 °C, indicating that the respiratory capacity was low and that acclimatization to increasing temperatures in springtime requires physiological changes in these clams.

Rates at acclimatization temperatures
The relations between the mean acclimatized respiration rates of the studied taxa and temperature are based on specimens from a great variety of microhabitats. Therefore, we expect these data to give a representative overview of metabolic temperature dependence in acclimatized mussels and clams. A narrow relation between temperature and acclimatized respiration rates in winter and springtime suggests that variations in the metabolic rate during this time of the year were directly dependent on temperature, and not limited by other physiological or environmental variables. A temperature-limited metabolic rate was also reflected by the high thermal sensitivity of the metabolic rate of some of the populations during those seasons. Only a few observations confirmed that the constant increase in respiration rates with acclimatization temperature can continue in summer and autumn, when most data points were found to be scattered below the upper edge slope. We suggest that the upper edge slopes represent the “metabolic scopes” of these taxa. However, since measurements are based on groups of specimens, respiration rates of single individuals can be higher.

). Towards tolerance limits, the arising breakpoint temperature will force down the “metabolic scope,” as indicated by the mussel populations from the Santa Giusta lagoon (21) and Gulfo di Oristano (20) in July, and for clams from Point d’Aiguillon (15) in July and October. Physiological rates that are acclimatized to (near) breakpoint temperatures are rarely described for ectotherms.

). It also explains the exceptionally high respiration rates of some populations from the North Sea group at high habitat temperatures, e.g., specific dynamic action, facilitated by high ambient food availability. Still, differential genetic adaptation to temperature may add to the observed physiological differences, and cannot be excluded as an explanation.

This is an important strategy that allows survival of temporary heat exposure, e.g., when exposed to the air during low tide in summer. The range and limits of this relation for mussels or clams have not been studied in depth yet.
