I-MIBG and start of acquisition, acquisition duration and type of collimator used) were collected.
The primary efficacy objective of the original trial was to determine the prognostic significance of the late H/M ratio in relation to occurrence of major cardiac events (MCE), defined as either: 1) cardiac death due to all causes, including myocardial infarction (MI), progressive heart failure and sudden cardiac death (SCD); 2) cardiac transplant; 3) potentially fatal arrhythmic event, including resuscitated cardiac arrest or appropriate internal cardiac defibrillator (ICD) discharge. Results of that analysis have been published. For the purposes of this paper, H/M thresholds associated with low-, intermediate- and high-risk for MCEs were defined to provide the basis for the multivariate analysis described below.

Discussion

123
I-MIBG can also be explained by differences in acquisition parameters. Of particular interest, the factors contributing to this variation differed for different ranges of late H/M.

I-MIBG imaging, these methodological and analytical limitations have hampered the implementation of this technique for the evaluation and management of individual patients.
Acquisition duration was one of the independent predictors of late H/M. The positive correlation suggests that a longer acquisition time is associated with a higher late H/M. However, it is more likely that this association reflects that a longer acquisition time results in a higher number of counts and the allied improvement of count statistics. In particular, in patients with reduced myocardial uptake (i.e. heart failure patients), the higher signal-to-noise ratio for a longer acquisition (≥10 min in the present study) plays a pivotal role in the accurate assessment of late H/M. In addition, delay after injection was in high-risk subjects (late H/M <1.4), an independent predictor of late H/M. The negative correlation suggests that a longer acquisition time is associated with a lower late H/M.
However, in analogy to acquisition duration, it is more likely that this association reflects that a longer delay results in a lower number of counts and the allied deterioration of count statistics. In particular, in patients with reduced myocardial uptake (i.e. heart failure patients), the higher signal-to-noise ratio for a shorter delay after injection plays a pivotal role in the accurate assessment of late H/M.

I-MIBG imaging might best be performed using ME collimators, there are practical limitations to such a recommendation. Almost all nuclear cardiology procedures are now performed on a multi-head gamma camera, and many dedicated dual-head cardiac cameras are not supplied with ME collimators (at least for SPECT).

I-MIBG. It is therefore important to establish the degree to which the collimator used affects prognostic utility of the H/M measurement.
123
15
23
123
I-MIBG can be reliably determined under widely different acquisition conditions. By comparison, considering user-controlled variables, assessment of high-risk subjects (H/M <1.4) was affected by delay after injection, while the assessment of H/M in the intermediate risk subjects was affected by the collimator employed. Standardisation therefore is most important in assessing patients with more severe disease, although in the present study the procedural variables only contributed a relatively small fraction of the overall variability in H/M determinations.

]. These single-centre experiences, however, do not necessarily allow for extrapolation of the obtained results to other centres. In spite of this, quantitative thresholds are often implemented without inter-institutional validation. Because there are differences between centres in hardware, acquisition parameters and post-acquisition processing, the extrapolation to other centres, or generalisation of these single-centre findings, is not per se justified. Especially due to the lack of well-defined data sets, validation in each separate centre and between centres has not been possible.

]. Moreover, the results should be validated in each separate centre and monitored for reproducibility and consistency.

123

123
I-MIBG (such as tricyclic antidepressants), was not significant and did not warrant a separate analysis.
The primary limitation of the present study has already been noted, namely, that the largest influence on the H/M is cardiac disease status rather than image acquisition parameters. Although collimation and acquisition duration were independent predictors of late H/M, their individual contributions to measurement variance were <10% each. Because of the retrospective nature of this multi-centre study, it was not possible to control for the effects of numerous variables that might have had undetected impact on late H/M. Studies using phantoms have already established the effect of collimator selection on H/M, and similar studies could be performed to examine the influence of count rate and total counts. Additional patient studies that included multiple acquisitions of different durations and times post-injection could establish the effect of these parameters on H/M with greater clarity.
123
123
123
123
I-MIBG imaging could become a routine procedure for evaluation of heart failure and other cardiac disease populations.
