Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) is a relatively new entity, first described in 1997. Few cases have been reported, but the disease has high morbidity and mortality. To date it has been seen exclusively in patients with renal dysfunction. There is an emerging link with intravenous injection of gadolinium contrast agents, which has been suggested as a main triggering factor, with a lag time of days to weeks. Risk factors include the severity of renal impairment, major surgery, vascular events and other proinflammatory conditions. There is no reason to believe that children have an altered risk compared to the adult population. It is important that the paediatric radiologist acknowledges emerging information on NSF but at the same time considers the risk:benefit ratio prior to embarking on alternative investigations, as children with chronic kidney disease require high-quality diagnostic imaging.

Link with gadolinium-based contrast agents

] was the first to report this association in January 2006. Grobner described nine patients with end-stage renal failure on dialysis who underwent MR angiography (MRA) with gadodiamide (Omniscan; GE Healthcare, Chalfont St Giles, UK); five (mean age 57.2±10.7 years) developed NSF after 2–4 weeks. All patients who developed NSF had confirmed metabolic acidosis, whilst all patients who did not develop NSF had normal pH and bicarbonate level at the time of the MRA. The average contrast agent volume used was 35 ml.
23
] reviewed case notes from their own nephrology department from August 2005 to May 2006 and found 13 patients with confirmed NSF, all exposed to gadodiamide. All patients were adults (33–66 years of age, mean 50 years), developed NSF 2–75 days (mean 25 days) after gadolinium exposure and had an eGFR <8 ml/min. From this cohort of renal patients the authors estimated an odds ratio between 32.5 and 47.6 for developing NSF following gadolinium exposure.

27
]. Patients were aged 23–71 years and the onset of symptoms consistent with NSF was between 19 days and 2 months after gadodiamide exposure. All patients had severe renal failure and were exposed to a gadodiamide dose ranging from 0.11 to 0.36 mmol/kg body weight. Despite having normal serum bicarbonate, five of the six patients had an elevated anion gap metabolic acidosis.
28
] have recently reported a retrospective study of 12 patients with NSF, all of whom received a double dose (0.2 mmol/kg body weight) of gadodiamide 2–11 weeks before the development of skin fibrosis. This group included eight men and four women (age 26–64 years) and all had renal insufficiency at the time of gadodiamide administration. The odds ratio for development of NSF in the gadodiamide-exposed patients compared with the gadodiamide-unexposed patients was 22.3 and the prevalence of NSF among gadodiamide-exposed dialysis patients was 4.0%. The odds ratio for development of NSF with double-dose compared to single-dose gadodiamide administration was 12.1. Ten patients were dialysed within 2 days of gadodiamide administration, but this failed to prevent the development of NSF.

] found a positive association between the cumulative dose of gadodiamide and the development of NSF. Patients who developed NSF had received a higher median cumulative dose of gadodiamide (0.39 mmol/kg vs. 0.23 mmol/kg in patients without NSF).
34
] conducted in 19 patients with histologically verified NSF and 19 matched controls found that increasing cumulative gadodiamide exposure, high-dose epoietin-b treatment and higher serum concentrations of ionized calcium and phosphate increase the risk of gadodiamide-related NSF in patients with renal failure.

] reported two paediatric patients with nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy: a 16-year-old female patient with a life-long history of kidney failure and an 8-year-old boy with a 9-month history of membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis type II. Both patients had the clinical and histopathological features of NSF and no contrast-enhanced MRI procedures were known to be associated with these patients. However, this was before the publication of a possible link with gadolinium.

] in 2003 (discussed above). The second patient was a 20-year-old male who at the age 14 years was diagnosed with acute monoblastic leukaemia and 2 years later underwent bone marrow transplant and later developed kidney failure. No references to contrast-enhanced MRI are available from these reports.
Our own hospital has a large paediatric renal unit with up to 30 renal transplants per year. We have actively used MRI both for concurrent conditions and complications to CKD, as well as for providing a presurgical vascular road-map, using contrast-enhanced MRA (Gd-DTPA, Magnevist, Schering, Germany, 0.1–0.3 mmol/kg, i.v.). A review of all contrast-enhanced scans in children referred via our nephrology service (March 2002 to March 2007) showed that 75 nephrology patients (neonate to 18 years of age; median 9.6 years) had had 93 MRI scans with a follow-up of at least 6 months. There were no patients with NSF in this high-risk cohort.

) or neonates and infants up to 1 year of age, Omniscan and Magnevist should be used only after careful consideration. All patients should be screened for renal dysfunction by obtaining a history and/or laboratory tests, especially before Omniscan or Magnevist are used. Haemodialysis shortly after administration of a gadolinium-containing MRI contrast agent in patients currently under haemodialysis may be useful for removal of contrast agent from the body. However, there is no evidence to suggest that haemodialysis can prevent or treat development of NSF. Careful consideration should also be given to the use of the other gadolinium-containing MRI contrast agents in patients with severe renal impairment.

Consequences for paediatric practice
2
, and in the presence of acidosis and proinflammatory conditions. The scarcity of reported children with NSF may well be due to the lower prevalence of CKD and secondary conditions in children. It is therefore imperative that paediatric practitioners are prudent and immediately tighten their local policies for use of intravenous gadolinium-based contrast agents.
The absolute risk of gadolinium exposure, as well as the risk associated with the suspected contributing clinical and biochemical factors, is unknown. Each case must therefore be assessed individually.

The risk attributable to the kinetic stability of different gadolinium-based agents is not clear. The majority of cases have been reported in association with a less stable agent (gadodiamide); however, we are still in an early stage of recording cases, and also the market share and the actual use of different agents in this patient population is not fully known. Thus, it seems reasonable to discontinue the use of gadodiamide in at-risk patients.

The relationship to dose is not completely known. Since there is no indication that we are dealing with a side effect not related to dose, it seems reasonable to reduce the dose of gadolinium if possible, and also to monitor the cumulative dose in at-risk patients.

It is unclear whether acidosis correction before gadolinium administration and haemodialysis immediately after gadolinium administration can prevent the development of, or treat, NSF, but such actions should be considered in children already on haemodialysis. This underlines the necessity for good communication between radiologists and nephrologists, both for issuing local guidelines and for management of the individual child.



It is often the case that MRI is requested after an inconclusive US examination. In our own experience, more meticulous patient preparation and dedicated rescanning of the patient with US can often give diagnostically adequate results. In patients with CKD not yet on dialysis CT is not a desirable alternative due to ionizing radiation and the nephrotoxicity of iodinated contrast agents. However, CT may provide an option in patients who are already on dialysis. MRI without intravenous contrast agent administration has not yet been validated for vascular anatomy prior to renal transplantation, but several techniques may be valuable, such as 3-D-balanced steady-state free precession imaging and time-of-flight angiography.
Patients with renal impairment may be referred for MRI from non-nephrology units and a crucial question is how to identify them. Our approach would be to include a mandatory tick box on the referral form requiring the referring clinician’s statement about renal function, and also to include a question about any known renal problems on the patient/guardian prescan checklist. This is a pragmatic approach, which will need revision after an initial phase.

Conclusion
We would advocate prudence, and in practice suggest:
Information collection from clinicians and patients/guardians on renal dysfunction and active collaboration with the local nephrology unit.

A case-by-case assessment in terms of the necessity for gadolinium-enhanced MRI, and whether an alternative test (repeat US, noncontrast-enhanced MRI, CT) would be acceptable.

Cumulative dose recording, reduction of the dose of any gadolinium-based contrast agent, and acting accordingly to guidance published in the literature.

Longer follow-up, especially in high-risk children.

GFR measurement or estimation should be part of a systematic prescan investigation in children with known or suspected renal dysfunction; however, a general screening is probably not justified.

To minimize the risks, we should take advantage of the current knowledge, and would suggest using cyclic nonionic compounds as they are more stable in vitro and therefore theoretically less likely to undergo transmetallation.
