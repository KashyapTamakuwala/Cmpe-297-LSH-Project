Surface-enhance resonance Raman scattering spectra of the heme–thiolate enzyme cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) adsorbed on Ag electrodes coated with 11-mercaptoundecanoic acid (MUA) were obtained in various experimental conditions. An analysis of these spectra, and a comparison between them and the RR spectra of CYP2D6 in solution, indicated that the enzyme’s active site retained its nature of six-coordinated low-spin heme upon immobilization. Moreover, the spectral changes detected in the presence of dextromethorphan (a CYP2D6 substrate) and imidazole (an exogenous heme axial ligand) indicated that the immobilized enzyme also preserved its ability to reversibly bind a substrate and form a heme–imidazole complex. The reversibility of these processes could be easily verified by flowing alternately solutions of the various compounds and the buffer through a home-built spectroelectrochemical flow cell which contained a sample of immobilized protein, without the need to disassemble the cell between consecutive spectral data acquisitions. Despite immobilized CYP2D6 being effectively reduced by a sodium dithionite solution, electrochemical reduction via the Ag electrode was not able to completely reduce the enzyme, and led to its extensive inactivation. This behavior indicated that although the enzyme’s ability to exchange electrons is not altered by immobilization per se, MUA-coated electrodes are not suited to perform direct electrochemistry of CYP2D6.

Besides confirming the retention of the enzyme’s function upon immobilization, SERRS spectra yield information about structural changes in the active site associated with substrate binding and electron transfer, the initial two steps of a CYP catalytic cycle.

The nickel nitrilotriacetic acid agarose was then applied to a polypropylene tube with a porous disk (Pierce, Perbio Science, Etten-Leur, The Netherlands), washed with potassium phosphate–glycerol buffer containing 2 mM histidine. Subsequently, bound CYP2D6 was eluted with 0.2 M histidine. After overnight dialysis in potassium phosphate–glycerol buffer the sample was concentrated on a Vivaspin 20 filtration tube (10,000 MWCO PES, Sartorius, Nieuwegein, The Netherlands) to a final concentration of 60 μM CYP2D6.

Therefore, despite the imidazole being expected to form a relatively strong bond with the heme iron, the nonequilibrium situation due to the constant flow of buffer over the CYP–imidazole complex eventually causes the complete dissociation of the imidazole from the enzyme and the concomitant restoration of a water molecule as sixth ligand, demonstrating that the CYP–imidazole complex formation is reversible.

]) plus the heme–protein surface distance, dithionite is free to diffuse closer to the enzyme redox center. Therefore, an unfavorable enzyme orientation with respect to the coated metal surface or a too large heme–electrode distance would be consistent with experimental data, since it would slow down or suppress the electron transfer from the electrode, while dithionite would still be able to effectively reduce the CYP2D6 heme. Moreover, the inability of the electrochemical approach to generate any amount of reduced enzyme in its active form, which is otherwise observed in dithionite-reduced protein samples, suggests that CYP2D6 inactivation is triggered by the application of potentials between −0.4 and −1.0 V during the enzyme-reduction attempts.

Conclusions
Upon immobilization on MUA-coated Ag electrodes, the human enzyme CYP2D6 retains its active-site structure, its ability to reversibly bind a substrate (DX) and an exogenous heme ligand (imidazole), and its capacity to exchange electrons, demonstrating the efficiency of the coating to prevent major protein conformational changes or denaturation. However, despite its success in preserving an intact protein structure, the MUA coating appears to be unsuitable for performing direct electrochemistry experiments on immobilized CYP2D6, since its reduced state could not be adequately achieved by varying the electrode potential. The application of potentials from −0.4 to −1.0 V appears to induce enzyme inactivation instead. Among other factors influencing the redox activity, a more favorable enzyme orientation or distance with respect to the electrode surface might be achieved using other coatings, an approach currently under study in our group.
In general, SERRS spectroscopy on coated Ag surfaces was proven to be successful in monitoring the active-site structure of immobilized CYP2D6, enabling the detection of reversible substrate and ligand binding using only very low amounts of protein. Besides its technological relevance as an optical biosensing tool, this technique might have a significant potential for fundamental research on the mechanisms of catalysis for CYPs, as well as for other heme enzymes.
