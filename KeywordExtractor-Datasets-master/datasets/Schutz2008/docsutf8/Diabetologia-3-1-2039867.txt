Aims/hypothesis
We determined the genetic contribution of 18 anthropometric and metabolic risk factors of type 2 diabetes using a young healthy twin population.

Methods
Traits were measured in 240 monozygotic (MZ) and 138 dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs aged 18 to 34 years. Twins were recruited from the Belgian population-based East Flanders Prospective Twin Survey, which is characterised by its accurate zygosity determination and extensive collection of perinatal and placental data, including information on chorionicity. Heritability was estimated using structural equation modelling implemented in the Mx software package.

Results
Intra-pair correlations of the anthropometric and metabolic characteristics did not differ between MZ monochorionic and MZ dichorionic pairs; consequently heritabilities were estimated using the classical twin approach. For body mass, BMI and fat mass, quantitative sex differences were observed; genetic variance explained 84, 85 and 81% of the total variation in men and 74, 75 and 70% in women, respectively. Heritability estimates of the waist-to-hip ratio, sum of four skinfold thicknesses and lean body mass were 70, 74 and 81%, respectively. The heritability estimates of fasting glucose, fasting insulin, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance and beta cell function, as well as insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1 levels were 67, 49, 48, 62 and 47%, in that order. Finally, for total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, total cholesterol:HDL-cholesterol ratio, triacylglycerol, NEFA and leptin levels, genetic factors explained 75, 78, 76, 79, 58, 37 and 53% of the total variation, respectively.

Conclusions/interpretation
Genetic factors explain the greater part of the variation in traits related to obesity, glucose intolerance/insulin resistance and dyslipidaemia.

If for a certain trait the correlation of the opposite-sex pairs is smaller than the correlations for the like-sexed DZ pairs, it is suggested that the correlation between additive genetic factors in opposite-sex pairs is smaller than 0.5. This indicates that different genetic factors influence this trait in men and women. To test this, a full heterogeneity model (variance components free to differ across sexes, plus the correlation between the additive genetic factors in opposite-sex pairs free to be estimated between 0 and 0.5) was compared with a quantitative heterogeneity model.

Despite the variety of measurements used to quantify obesity, the heritabilities of the different measurements were consistently in a high range, indicating that the contribution of genetic factors to total phenotypic variation in obesity is of great importance in the studied twin sample.

]. The smaller sample size of some studies could be responsible for their not observing a DE model. Furthermore, the presence of non-additive genetic effects has not always been tested. However, if non-additive genetic effects are observed, this implies that a part of the variance is explained by interactions between alleles at the same locus or on different loci. Although this observation is likely to be the result of lack of power, we cannot exclude real non-additive genetic effects in the absence of additive genetic effects, as these three traits are closely related to or are a direct gene product.

], our study suggests that the search for candidate genes might be more efficient in a young homogeneous population.
In conclusion, this study is the first large study to give a comprehensive overview of the heritabilities of multiple risk factors related to type 2 diabetes within the same twin sample. The variation of traits related to obesity, glucose intolerance/insulin resistance and dyslipidaemia in this Belgian twin sample is in general highly explained by genetic factors. These high heritabilities are very promising for follow-up to this research, in which, in order to explain some of the genetic variance observed, sib-pair linkage analyses will be performed using microsatellite markers located in the close vicinity of selected candidate genes.
