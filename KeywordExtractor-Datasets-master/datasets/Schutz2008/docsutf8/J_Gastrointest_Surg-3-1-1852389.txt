Introduction
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma has a high mortality rate with limited treatment options. One option is pancreaticoduodenectomy, although complete resection may require venous resection. Pancreaticoduodenectomy with venous resection and reconstruction is becoming a more common practice with many choices for venous reconstruction. We describe the technique of using the left renal vein as a conduit for venous reconstruction during pancreaticoduodenectomy.

Methods
The technique for use of the left renal vein as an interposition graft for venous reconstruction during pancreaticoduodenectomy is described as well as outcomes for nine patients that have undergone the procedure.

Results
Nine patients, seven men, with a mean age of 57 years, have undergone the operation. There were eight interposition grafts and one patch graft. Mean operating time was 7.8 hours, and mean tumor size was 3.4 cm. Eight patients had node-positive disease, and six had involvement of the vein. Mean hospital stay was 14 days and perioperative morbidity included a superficial wound infection, delayed gastric emptying, ascites, and gastrointestinal bleeding in one patient each. Creatinine ranged from 0.8–1.1 mg/dl preoperatively and from 0.7–1.3 mg/dl at discharge. Mean follow-up was 6.8 months with normal creatinine values noted through the follow-up period. Two patients had died during follow-up from recurrent disease at 8.3 and 18.2 months after the operation.

Conclusions
The left renal vein provides an additional choice for an autologous graft during pancreaticoduodenectomy with venous resection. The ease of harvesting the graft and maintenance of renal function distinguish its use.

 We describe the technique of mesenteric venous reconstruction after PD with venous resection using a left renal vein graft and report on a group of patients that have undergone this repair.

Patient Selection and Technique
Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) is used to evaluate a pancreatic head mass and its relation to vascular structures. CT accurately diagnoses mesenteric vein involvement, aiding in operative planning. The CT is also used to assess the length and caliber of the left renal vein, the status of the kidneys bilaterally, and the presence of the left gonadal and adrenal veins, which serve as collateral venous drainage. Additional imaging of the pancreas with endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is frequently used to further evaluate the location and extent of any venous involvement.

 Mobilization of superior mesenteric vein in preparation of venous reconstruction.




The superior border of the pancreas is approached by incising the gastrohepatic ligament. The right gastric and gastroduodenal arteries are routinely ligated and divided. Retraction of the common hepatic artery cephalad allows dissection of the portal vein (PV), thereby, allowing completion of the plane between the pancreas and the PV-SMV.
The gallbladder is dissected from the liver, and the hepatic duct is encircled near the cystic duct junction. If a pylorus-preserving PD is planned, the superior and inferior aspects of the duodenum are skeletonized, individually ligating the right gastroepiploic vessels. The ligament of Treitz is mobilized, and the proximal jejunum is divided. Sequential ligation and division of the bowel mesentery exposes the uncinate process. The mobilized duodenum and jejunum are passed beneath the superior mesenteric vessels into the right upper quadrant.

) as necessary. Inflow occlusion of the SMA during posterior dissection is used selectively if maintenance of hemostasis is problematic.




Mobilization of the portal vein superior to the pancreas and the peritoneum along the root of the small bowel mesentery may provide length for the SMV or PV segment. This is accomplished by ligating and dividing small branches to the SMV, PV, and splenic vein (SV). Although primary end-to-end anastomosis is preferred, if interposition grafting is necessary, autologous vein and specifically the left renal vein is utilized for two reasons. First, the vein may be exposed within the same operative field, thereby, eliminating a second operative field and dissection. Second, the caliber and wall thickness of the vein is similar to the portal vein in most instances, providing good handling and suturing properties. Harvest of the left renal vein is undertaken after the retroperitoneal dissection when the specimen remains attached to the portal vein segment only (before venous resection). This allows the best assessment of the need for interposition grafting and minimizes the amount of clamp time by harvesting the graft before SMA and venous occlusion.

In the example shown, reconstruction of the PV-SMV confluence with an interposition graft utilizing left renal vein was performed initially, followed by reimplantation of the splenic vein into the graft (end-to-side) Gastrointestinal reconstruction is performed in a standard fashion after completion of venous reconstruction.





Results
Nine patients have undergone reconstruction of the SMV-PV during PD with an autologous left renal vein graft. There were seven men and two women with a mean age of 57 years (range, 31–77). Preoperative abdominal CT had suggested mesenteric vein involvement in seven of the nine patients. EUS was completed in three patients. In one patient, EUS suggested there was no vein involvement, while in the remaining two patients, EUS did suggest involvement. Preoperative serum creatinine levels ranged from 0.8 to 1.1 mg/dl in these patients (normal values 0.9–1.4 mg/dl ). Mean follow-up was 6.8 months.
The procedure consisted of three standard PD and six pylorus-preserving PD. Venous reconstruction consisted of eight interposition grafts and one patch graft. The patch graft was located on the lateral edge of the SMV and PV. Five of the interposition grafts were placed in the SMV, inferior to the confluence. One interposition graft was placed between the SMV and PV with reimplantation of the splenic vein; an additional was placed between the SMV and PV without reimplantation of the splenic vein, and the final graft was in the portal vein. The mean operating time was 7.8 hours (range, 6.5–9.5). The mean tumor size was 3.4 cm (range, 2.2–5). The mean estimated blood loss was 1,300 ml (range, 350–2,500). Eight patients were found to have node-positive disease with six of these patients noted to have histological involvement of the venous segment, while one additional patient had pathologically negative lymph nodes and no evidence of malignant invasion of the vein. In two patients, the uncinate margin was microscopically positive.
One patient was monitored overnight in the intensive care unit. There were no operative mortalities, and reoperation was not required in any of the patients. The mean length of hospitalization was 14 days (range, 9–29). Immediate perioperative morbidity included a superficial wound infection in one patient, delayed gastric emptying in one patient, and postoperative gastrointestinal bleeding in one patient. None of the patients experienced a pancreatic leak. No hematuria was noted. One patient was diagnosed with ascites and stenosis of the left renal vein interposition graft anastomosis 1 month after the operation. This patient had a congenitally cystic (nonfunctioning) left kidney. The left renal vein was reduced in caliber, but felt to be adequate for grafting at the time of the original operation. The patient underwent stenting of the graft by interventional radiology with resolution of her symptoms. Eight patients underwent adjuvant treatment, which included radiation therapy in six patients. None of the six patients receiving radiation therapy experienced a decrement in renal function after radiation therapy. Two patients had died 8.3 and 18.2 months after the operation of recurrent disease. Median survival has not been reached.

 as a conduit. While these groups have demonstrated good results with these conduits, the use of the left renal vein for autologous grafting offers some significant advantages and avoids the handling difficulties that can be encountered with the internal jugular vein and the risk of lymphedema or venous thrombosis that can be encountered with use of the superficial femoral vein.

 The caliber of the graft allows for excellent flow, as demonstrated by CT and Doppler ultrasound. The ease of harvesting the graft also is an important consideration. Exposure of the left renal vein can be accomplished through a standard PD incision, without requiring any further prepping, an additional incision, or the need for an additional operating team. Furthermore, use of the left renal vein leaves the patient with all possible routes of central venous access.

 In our series, serum creatinine levels transiently increased after operation, but all normalized before discharge. Creatinine levels remained normal throughout follow-up.

Conclusions
Resection offers the only chance at cure for patients with pancreatic cancer, and potentially curative resection may require venous resection. When reconstruction of the venous system necessitates the use of interposition grafting, autologous vein interposition grafts are preferred. The left renal vein provides an additional choice for an autologous graft, and its use is distinguished by ease of harvest and maintenance of renal function. The use of the left renal vein for interposition grafting and patch repair should be considered by surgeons experienced in SMV-PV reconstruction during PD.
