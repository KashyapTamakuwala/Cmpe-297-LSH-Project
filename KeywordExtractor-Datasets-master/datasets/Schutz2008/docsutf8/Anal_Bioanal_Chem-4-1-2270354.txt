The heritability of chronic hepatitis in the Labrador Retriever is studied with the aim of identifying the related gene mutation. Identification of cases and controls is largely based on instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA) Cu determination in liver biopsies. The burden for these companion animals may be reduced if nail clippings and hair (fur) could serve as a noninvasive indicator for the hepatic Cu concentrations. No correlation was found between hepatic Cu concentrations and Cu concentrations in hair and nail samples. However, hair and nail samples were also analyzed by X-ray tube excitation, taking advantage of the X-ray Compton, Rayleigh, and Raman scattering which reflects the organic components such as the type of melanin. Principal component analysis provided first indications that some differentiation between healthy and sick dogs could indeed be obtained from hair and nail analysis.

Both approaches were tested here, i.e., (i) Cu determination via instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA) in liver biopsies, nail clippings, and hair samples; and (ii) X-ray spectrum acquisition after X-ray tube excitation, followed by full spectrum data (i.e. all channel contents) processing by PCA, including the often neglected peakless part of the X-ray scattering region resulting from Compton, Rayleigh and Raman effects.

Experimental
Liver biopsy samples, nail clippings, and hair were collected from approximately 100 dogs with chronic hepatitis as well as from healthy animals. Nail clippings were taken from phalanx I (the thumb nail), since this nail is not in contact with the ground, thus minimizing contamination problems. Nail clippings could not be collected from all animals as in some cases breeders had removed the nail permanently shortly after birth, since sometimes such a thumb nail hinders the dog in working trials. Hair was sampled from the median abdominal wall, just cranial to the belly button.
The liver biopsy samples were freeze-dried at the veterinary clinic. The nail clippings and hair samples were analyzed without cleaning to prevent changes in the nail and hair morphology that might affect the scattering information from the X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analysis. It should be noted that a Cu contamination of the nail clipping and hair is highly unlikely; the nail of the thumb nail is never in contact with, e.g., soil, and external contamination of the hair was also unlikely.
INAA
The needle biopsies were transferred into polyethylene capsules and lyophilized, resulting in sample masses varying typically between 1.5 and 50 mg dry weight. Nail clippings had masses of 5–50 mg, and the typical mass of the hair samples was approximately 100–200 mg.

Cu.

X-ray tube excitation
The measuring procedure consisted of weighing approximately 100 mg of each hair sample and 10 mg of each nail sample directly into appropriate cells and submitting them to blank rhodium X-ray tube radiation, in triplicate. A common laboratory energy dispersive XRF instrument (EDX 700, Shimadzu) was used under the same irradiation conditions: 50-kV applied voltage in the tube, 25% dead time, 10-mm beam collimation, and 100-s irradiation time. It should be noted that the methodology of using the region in the X-ray spectrum resulting from scattering implies that only the spectrum’s shape is needed for the data processing by PCA. There is no need for quantification towards Cu mass fractions, and hence no reference materials were used for quality control as was the case in the hair, nail, and liver biopsy analysis by INAA.

) show that sulfur and Rh scatter (Compton, Rayleigh, and Raman) explain the variance in PC1. This is most likely attributed to variations in (sulfur bondings in) keratin structures. This effect contributes to almost 100% of the data variance. The rest of it, PC2, is not very large (approximately 1–10%) and allows for separations due to differences in sulfur, and to some extent with melanin.

S, hardly shows any correlation with INAA Cu liver values (correlation coefficients 0.03 and 0.32 for nail and hair, respectively). However, the INAA results provide only the total sulfur content, i.e., sulfur present in keratin, melanin, and any other compound, whereas the PCs of the channel contents of the X-ray spectra, especially due to the peakless scattered region, apply to sulfur directly related to keratin and/or melanin. This explains the much better correlation of “keratin/melanin” sulfur with Cu liver values compared with total S with Cu.
The results of our study show that a fairly sharp differentiation can be obtained between dogs with low and high Cu liver levels if PCA is performed on a dataset obtained from all channel contents of X-ray spectra obtained by X-ray tube excitation of nail or hair samples together with the spectral information of often neglected X-ray (Rayleigh, Raman) scattered radiation.
A practical application of this technique would start with construction of a dataset using samples of known origin, encompassing all varieties expected. New and unknown samples can then be projected on this model, and subsequently classified. This approach will be further validated with new samples to be collected from Labrador Retrievers still being observed and treated along medicinal and dietary approaches.

Conclusions
Hair and nail clippings are widely used as bioindicators for the trace element status of man and, to a much lesser extent, also for animals. The results of this study emphasize that it is quite risky to assume a priori that the trace element levels in hair and nail reflect differences between classes of individuals, e.g., “healthy” and “sick” people or animals. In this study related to chronic hepatitis, the Cu levels in liver biopsies are not reflected by Cu levels in hair and nail.
The X-ray Rayleigh scattered and X-ray Raman continuum contain valuable information about the organic, low-Z elemental matrix composition of an object. In this study, first indications were obtained that the Cu accumulation possibly may have an effect on the nail and hair melanin, thus offering a potentially favorable outlook for noninvasive monitoring of the Cu liver status. An additional advantage of the approach is that a measurement by X-ray tube excitation takes only about 2 min per sample so that, once a database has been built up, the technique might be valuable for large-scale screening purposes.
