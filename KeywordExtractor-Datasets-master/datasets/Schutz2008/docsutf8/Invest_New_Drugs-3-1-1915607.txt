Summary

14
C]ixabepilone over 3 h. Plasma, urine and faeces were collected up to 7 days after administration and total radioactivity (TRA) was determined using AMS. Ixabepilone in plasma and urine was quantitated using a validated LC-MS/MS method. Mean recovery of ixabepilone-derived radioactivity was 77.3% of dose. Fecal excretion was 52.2% and urinary excretion was 25.1%. Only a minor part of TRA is accounted for by unchanged ixabepilone in both plasma and urine, which indicates that metabolism is a major elimination mechanism for this drug. Future studies should focus on structural elucidation of ixabepilone metabolites and characterization of their activities.

C]ixabepilone over 3 h. The protocol and informed consent form were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Antoni van Leeuwenhoek Hospital/The Netherlands Cancer Institute, and each patient gave written informed consent before receiving the study medication. Eligibility criteria most relevant to the mass balance study were: availability for in-house admittance during the first 8 days, adequate hepatic and renal function, a performance status (PS) of 0–2, and a life expectancy of at least 12 weeks.

Sample collection
Blood was collected at 0 (pre-dose), 1.5, 3 (prior to end of infusion), 3.25, 3.5, 3.75, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 24, 48, 72, 120, and 168 h after start of infusion. An indwelling catheter contra-lateral to the administration site was used for serial blood sampling. Separate, but simultaneous, blood samples were taken for the quantitation of total radioactivity and unchanged ixabepilone, respectively. Plasma was obtained by immediate centrifugation of the blood (10 min, 1000 × g, 4°C). The plasma layer was aspirated and stored below −20°C until analysis. We collected complete urinary and faecal output up to 7 days after administration. Urine was collected over 24-h intervals in refrigerated collection jugs. At the end of each collection interval, the respective urine samples were mixed and total volume was recorded. Aliquots were stored below −20°C until analysis. Faecal samples were collected and stored at −20°C per portion and combined per 24-h interval. Faeces were homogenized after addition of water (2:1, w/w). Aliquots were stored below −20°C until analysis.

Analysis of ixabepilone in plasma and urine
Concentrations of ixabepilone parent drug in plasma and urine were determined with a validated liquid chromatography assay equipped with tandem mass spectrometric detection (Bristol-Myers Squibb, Princeton, NJ). Briefly, after addition of internal standard (BMS-212188) to 0.2 ml of each sample, calibration standard and quality control sample, the samples were precipitated with acetone. The supernatant was further extracted with 1-chlorobutane. The organic layer was removed and evaporated to dryness. The residue was reconstituted and injected into the LC-MS/MS system. Chromatographic separation was achieved, isocratically, on a YMC ODS-AQ column (4.6 × 50 mm internal diameter) at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min with detection by electrospray tandem mass spectrometry. The mobile phase contained acetonitrile—0.01 M ammonium acetate (pH 5.0) (65:35, v/v). The standard curve, which ranged from 2 to 500 ng/ml, was constructed with a 1/x weighted quadratic regression model. The within-run precision for ixabepilone in plasma and urine was within 15 and 9%, respectively. The between-run precision for ixabepilone in plasma and urine was within 13 and 9%, respectively. The accuracy was within 11 and 6% of the nominal values in plasma and urine, respectively.

Patients 1, 2, and 8 were male.
b
Patient 4 was not included because of the extremely low production of faeces and patient 8 was not included in the calculation because his bile duct obstruction (relevance illustrated by increasing plasma bilirubin concentrations) may have reduced faecal excretion.
c
The U/F ratio is the ratio of urinary recovery relative to faecal recovery.



On average, more than 77% of the drug was excreted over the 7-day period with the majority of 52% being excreted in faeces and 25% in urine. Excretion in faeces occurred at a relatively constant rate over the entire collection period, with only 10 and 12% of dose recovered in the 0–24 and 24–48 h collection intervals, respectively. In contrast, urinary excretion displayed two distinct phases with 65% of total urinary radioactivity (corresponding to 17% of dose) and 76% of total urinary ixabepilone being excreted in the first 24 h. From 24 to 168 h, urinary excretion occurred at a relatively slow constant rate. This may reflect the biphasic plasma curve, with high concentrations in the distribution phase and lower concentrations in the terminal elimination phase. At first urinary excretion predominates and after 24 h, faecal excretion becomes the dominant route of excretion.

 and Cl of ixabepilone was 24 and 21% as compared to 46 and 38% in the phase I dose escalation study. The lower inter-patient variability may result from the greater rigor toward sample collection and processing that is possible in a mass balance study during which the patient is hospitalized. It should also be noted that the administration of ixabepilone as a flat 70 mg dose in the present study did not result in any increase in inter-patient variability compared with the dose, based on body surface area, which was administered during the phase I study.

 of 73.1 and 50.3 h respectively), however, we do not conclude that TRA was eliminated more slowly than ixabepilone. Comparison of ixabepilone and TRA half-lives per patient revealed that in 5 cases (patient 2, 3, 4, 7, and 8) the TRA half-life was shorter than the ixabepilone half-life. The mean TRA half-life was disproportionally influenced by the long half-life observed in patient 5 (185 h). The very long half-life of TRA in this patient is not likely to be clinically relevant because this patient excreted 85% of the dose within 7 days. Based on the half-lives for plasma radioactivity observed in the other patients, in the once every 3 weeks administration schedule, accumulation of metabolites should not occur. The seemingly long ixabepilone half-life of over 50 h is not unusual when compared to other tubulin-interacting drugs. Half-lives of e.g. vinca-alkaloids range from 12–42 h for vindesine and up to a half-life of several days for vincristine.

 506.7 g/mol, and rather hydrophobic). Whether this is the case for ixabepilone remains to be investigated by metabolic profiling of the excreta.
Given the normal ixabepilone plasma concentrations of patient 8 while experiencing a blocked bile duct, biliary excretion of unchanged ixabepilone into faeces may not be a very important elimination route, and the results suggest that ixabepilone was equally well metabolised but that the biliary excretion of these metabolites was hindered by the blocked bile duct stent, resulting in a shift to urinary excretion of total radioactivity.
The importance of metabolism in the elimination of ixabepilone has been confirmed by this study as apparent from the low contribution of unchanged ixabepilone to TRA in plasma and urine. Ixabepilone related radioactivity is predominantly excreted in the faeces. Future investigations must be aimed at elucidating the metabolic fate of ixabepilone, and determining the activity of the metabolites. Subsequent identification of drug metabolizing enzymes involved in ixabepilone metabolism may result in explaining pharmacokinetic variability of ixabepilone in individual patients.
