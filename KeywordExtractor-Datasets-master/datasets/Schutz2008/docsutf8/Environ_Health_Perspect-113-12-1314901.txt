Tobacco is a heavily pesticide-dependent crop. Because pesticides involve human safety and health issues, they are regulated nationally and internationally; however, little is known about how tobacco companies respond to regulatory pressures regarding pesticides. In this study we analyzed internal tobacco industry documents to describe industry activities aimed at influencing pesticide regulations. We used a case study approach based on examination of approximately 2,000 internal company documents and 3,885 pages of U.S. Environmental Protection Agency documents obtained through Freedom of Information Act requests. The cases involved methoprene, the ethylene bisdithiocarbamates, and phosphine. We show how the tobacco industry successfully altered the outcome in two cases by hiring ex-agency scientists to write reports favorable to industry positions regarding pesticide regulations for national (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency) and international (World Health Organization) regulatory bodies. We also show how the industry worked to forestall tobacco pesticide regulation by attempting to self-regulate in Europe, and how Philip Morris encouraged a pesticide manufacturer to apply for higher tolerance levels in Malaysia and Europe while keeping tobacco industry interest a secret from government regulators. This study suggests that the tobacco industry is able to exert considerable influence over the pesticide regulatory process and that increased scrutiny of this process and protection of the public interest in pesticide regulation may be warranted.

Internal tobacco industry documents provide a window into the tobacco industry’s activities regarding pesticide regulations. These case studies drawn from industry documents describe the tobacco industry’s responses to pesticide regulatory action. The documents also provide insight into the relationships between the tobacco industry and pesticide regulatory agencies and tensions between business and public health interests.

 provides examples of keyword searches and the number of documents yielded. This process produced nearly 300,000 documents relating to many different pesticides. The first author reviewed these documents’ index entries and excluded duplicates and documents unrelated to pesticide regulatory issues. The final sample size was approximately 2,000 documents, spanning 1974–2001.

 explained that
My experience is that consultant reports funded by those being regulated, and written expressly for the EPA, are easily and frequently ignored or dismissed by the Agency, no matter how scholarly. However, a paper or article that is peer-reviewed and published, or in the peer review process for publication, in an accepted scientific journal can neither be ignored nor dismissed.

Conclusion
Abraham 2002

), it is rare to be able to study this process from the perspective of the regulated industry. This study provides documentation of the behind-the-scenes activities of an industry as it attempts to influence the regulatory process on matters that have a direct bearing on public health.
Liberman 2002
); others may have never been obtained in the legal discovery process. In addition, we had no access to pesticide company documents, except those in the tobacco documents archives. Finally, despite properly filed Freedom of Information Act requests, we were unable to obtain from the U.S. EPA documentation of its meetings with the industry’s Commodity Industry Coalition. All minutes of meetings with stakeholders should be part of the public record.
Despite these limitations, the case studies discussed here provide insight into tactics that the tobacco industry applies to a regulatory agency when trying to influence the outcome of a decision. These tactics go significantly beyond the usual approaches—such as participation in public comment periods and public meetings—to influence scientific and regulatory decision making. Tobacco industry tactics described in these cases include:
Encouraging a chemical company (Zoecon) to advocate for high MRLs without any supporting data and directing that same company to gather information about international regulatory efforts on methoprene in a manner designed to hide the interest of the tobacco industry in this chemical;

Attempting to forestall regulatory efforts on tobacco pesticides in the European Community by creating voluntary industry MRLs for a subset of chemicals;

Hiring an ex-WHO scientist to participate (without disclosing his funding source) in the WHO regulatory effort on EBDCs;

Hiring several ex-U.S. EPA scientists to influence the U.S. EPA’s regulatory decision making on phosphine;

a priori
 arguments and funding consultants to publish a report supporting these arguments in a journal over which the consultants had influence;

Staging fumigations for the U.S. EPA with the knowledge that the methodology was flawed and the results would show no emissions problem.


Yet, as the case of European MRLs showed, the tobacco industry does not always work together effectively to influence regulations. Tobacco companies may disagree about regulatory strategies or conclude that inaction is preferable to action that might have unintended consequences. Moreover, the fact that even voluntary, industry-friendly pesticide guidelines posed significant problems for Philip Morris underscores tobacco industry motivation for resisting or influencing more stringent, government-imposed regulations.

).
Protection of the public interest hinges on an open process and regulatory agencies’ willingness to stand up to pressure from regulated industries. When these are in doubt, public confidence in the fairness and efficacy of regulations may be unwarranted. The resource disparities between powerful industries and public health organizations may also make it difficult to ensure that the public interest is fairly represented, particularly when discussions occur behind closed doors, as apparently occurred at the U.S. EPA. Increased public and media scrutiny of these processes could help ensure that public health considerations are weighed at least as heavily as commercial ones.
WHO 2004
), is it in the public interest for regulatory agencies today to continue facilitating standards that make it easier and less costly to grow, transport, store, and manufacture tobacco products?

Outcome


Methoprene
MRL of 1.0 ppm
1991–1995
Malaysian pesticide board
Work through chemical industry partners to avoid raising tobacco issues, request higher MRL with no supporting research
MRL raised to 15 ppm

Methoprene, others
Industry concern about future MRLs
1991–1993
European Community
Attempt to create voluntary MRLs to forestall regulation
No voluntary MRLs, no EC regulations

EBDCs/ETU
Potential imposition of residue tolerances
1989–1993
UN FAO/WHO JMPR
Hire ex-WHO scientist to review EBDCs and ETU, covertly lobby and assist JMPR
ETU listed as not genotoxic, higher ADI assigned

Phosphine
15 proposed risk mitigation measures including worker exposure standard of 0.03 ppm
1998–2001
U.S. EPA
Hire consultant with EPA ties to challenge scientific basis of proposed exposure standard, write journal article
Worker exposure standard increased to 0.3 ppm
