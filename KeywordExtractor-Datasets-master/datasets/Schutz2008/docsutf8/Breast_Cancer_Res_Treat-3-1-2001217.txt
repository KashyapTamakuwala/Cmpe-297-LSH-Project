The impact of improved treatments for the management of hormone-sensitive breast cancer extends beyond clinical responses. Thanks to appropriate literature and access to the internet, patient awareness of treatment options has grown and patients are now, in many cases, able to engage their oncologists in informed conversations regarding treatment and what to expect in terms of efficacy and safety. Indeed, patients realize that although there is no cure for metastatic disease, treatment can greatly reduce the risk of progression and in the adjuvant setting, where treatment is administered with a curative intent, current treatment options reduce the risk of relapse. The approval of letrozole throughout the breast cancer continuum has provided patients with many reassuring options. The improvement in outcome with letrozole is achieved without a detrimental effect on overall quality of life. Adverse events such as hot flushes, arthralgia, vaginal dryness, and potential osteoporosis are most significant from the patient’s perspective, and it is important that caregivers pay attention to patients experiencing these events, as they can impact compliance unless effectively explained and managed. The major benefits of letrozole are to improve prospects for long-term survivorship in the adjuvant setting and to delay progression and the need for chemotherapy in the metastatic setting.

The greater suppression of estradiol levels might translate into improved clinical efficacy, although further studies, such as the ongoing Femara Anastrozole Clinical Evaluation trial, are required to confirm these findings.

]. Thus, the proven efficacy of letrozole given after a tamoxifen-free period means that physicians need to discuss the option of restarting endocrine therapy with almost all patients. Physicians have to consider how best to address this topic with patients who are up to 2–3 years out beyond their initial 5 years of tamoxifen, i.e. about 5–8 years after their initial diagnosis. This will be a major communication challenge and create a dilemma for patients who may feel well and have put their breast cancer behind them.

]. From the patient’s perspective, the major benefits of letrozole are improving prospects for long-term survivorship (“cure”) in the adjuvant setting and delaying progression and the need for chemotherapy in the metastatic setting.
Endocrine therapy is very effective, has a generally favorable safety profile, and adds to the efficacy of chemotherapy. However, a major challenge for both physicians and patients is ensuring compliance with long-term daily therapy. This may be a particular problem in the extended adjuvant setting, where the patient may face the prospect of life-long therapy. As patients no longer feel sick, it is understandable that they may forget to take a dose and gradually lose interest in continuing with the treatment. Letrozole is well-tolerated and, as with all AIs, the majority of adverse events are secondary to the suppression of estrogen. The most important adverse events from the patient’s perspective are the “visible” ones, such as hot flushes, vaginal dryness, and arthralgias. To achieve optimal compliance, patients need to feel that physicians are taking their adverse events seriously and taking appropriate steps to alleviate any problems. Physicians who treat very few breast cancer patients may not have sufficient experience with AIs to satisfactorily manage individuals who are experiencing these adverse events.

 and the future). Considering its efficacy and favorable side-effect profile, it is the logical choice for inclusion in new regimens, including combinations with novel agents. As the future unfolds, the management of breast cancer is set for further change, and it is essential that patients are informed and educated so that they can actively participate in treatment decisions and thus derive the most benefit from treatment advances.
