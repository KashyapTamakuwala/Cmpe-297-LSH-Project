We assessed the pretreatment health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and functional status of patients with advanced oral and oropharyngeal cancer. Eighty patients were investigated. HRQOL was assessed by EORTC QLQ-C30/QLQ-H&N35 questionnaires. Functional status assessment comprised speech and oral function tests. The results revealed a wide range of HRQOL and functional deficits before treatment. HRQOL appeared to be related to some extent to tumor site (patients with oral tumors reported more pain compared to patients with oropharyngeal tumors) and tumor classification (patients with T3–T4 tumors reported more trouble opening the mouth and felt more ill compared to patients with T2 tumors). Comorbidity appeared to have a major impact. Patients with comorbidity had significantly worse scores on several scales/items on both the EORTC questionnaires. Functional deficits were related to tumor site, classification and comorbidity. Patients with oral cavity tumors (versus oropharyngeal tumors), patients with T3–T4 tumors (versus T2 tumors), and patients with comorbidity (versus without comorbidity) scored significantly worse on several speech and oral function tests. Impaired speech and oral function appeared to be clearly related to global quality of life (QLQ-C30) and self-reported speech (QLQ-H&N35). Many patients with advanced oral and oropharyngeal cancer have compromised HRQOL and functional status before the start of treatment. In addition to tumor site and tumor classification, comorbidity appears to have a major impact on HRQOL and functional status. Knowledge of pretreatment HRQOL and functional status levels is useful for better understanding the impact of treatment on these outcomes over time.

The primary objective of the present study is to assess pretreatment HRQOL and functional status in relation to tumor site, tumor classification and comorbidity, in a well-defined group of patients with advanced oral and oropharyngeal cancer.

Patients and methods
Patients
Between January 1998 and December 2001, 92 consecutive patients diagnosed with stage II-IV oral or oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas were asked to participate in the study. The planned treatment was composite resection with microvascular soft tissue transfer (i.e., radial forearm free flap) for the reconstruction of surgical defects, and radiotherapy on indication. Exclusion criteria were age greater than 75 years, serious cognitive impairment and lack of basic fluency in the Dutch language. Twelve patients declined to participate, resulting in a final sample of 80 patients (response rate = 87%). All patients were treated at the Department of Otolaryngology/Head and Neck Surgery of the VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.

Data collection and study measures
All data were collected prior to the start of treatment, including sociodemographics (age and gender), disease stage, comorbidity, HRQOL, and functional status. Comorbidity was assessed dichotomously (yes or no) by review of medical records and on the basis of self-report, and was noted if one or more relevant medical ailments accompanied the primary medical illness. The comorbid conditions were cardiovascular, respiratory, gastro-intestinal, renal, endocrine, neurological, and immunological disorders, previous malignancy and considerable weight loss or alcohol abuse. For example, cardiovascular problems such as a myocardial infarct or hypertension, respiratory problems such as restrictive lung disease or COPD, or endocrine disorders such as diabetes mellitus with insulin usage were defined as relevant comorbid conditions.

]. The QLQ-C30 is composed of multi-item scales and single items assessing five areas of functioning (physical, role, emotional, cognitive, and social), fatigue, pain, emesis, dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, and diarrhea. Overall quality of life and the perceived financial impact of the disease and treatment are also assessed. The head and neck cancer-specific QLQ-H&N35 module comprises seven symptom scales: pain, swallowing, senses, speech, social eating, social contact, and sexuality. There are 11 additional, single items covering problems with teeth, opening the mouth wide, dry mouth, sticky saliva, cough, feeling ill, weight loss, weight gain, use of nutritional supplements, feeding tubes, and painkillers. The scores of both the QLQ-C30 and of the QLQ-H&N35 are linearly transformed to a scale of 0–100, with a higher score indicating a higher (i.e., more positive) level of functioning or global HRQOL, or a higher (i.e., more negative) level of symptoms or problems.

Speech and oral functional status
Speech analyses were performed according to a standardized speech assessment protocol. Speech recordings of a read aloud text were performed in a sound-treated room and digitized using Cool Edit PRO 1.2 (Adobe Systems Incorporated, San Jose, CA, USA) with 22 kHz sample frequency and 16 bit resolution. Recording level was adjusted for each speaker to optimize signal-to-noise ratio. All recordings were made with a mouth-to-microphone distance of 30 cm. A computer program was developed to perform blinded randomized speech evaluation and to score overall intelligibility, and quality of articulation and nasal resonance. Overall intelligibility was assessed on a 10-point scale ranging from poor to excellent by two trained speech therapists. Scores below six were defined as insufficient intelligibility (according to the Dutch educational system). To obtain more insight into the cause of decreased intelligibility, evaluation of the quality of articulation and nasal resonance was performed by the same two speech therapists on a 4-point scale ranging from deviant (score 1–3) to normal (score 4). Speech rate was measured by calculating words per minute on a read aloud standardized text.
23
]. All assessments were based on 5-point scales ranging from poor to excellent (transformed scores ranging from 0–100). The oral function evaluation included three tests; (1) tongue mobility (mean score of tongue straight out, elevation of tongue tip, elevation of the base of the tongue, tongue deviation left and right, symmetry left and right, and tongue withdrawal), (2) lip mobility (mean score of general movement, spreading and rounding, symmetry left/right, lip closure without speech, and lip closure during speaking), and (3) diadochokinesis (mean score of repetitive motion ability concerning tongue movement left/right, up/down, and in/out, and repeating the syllables /ta/ /cha/, and /ka/). Tongue and lip strength were quantified by a calibrated digital voltameter. To measure tongue strength the patient was asked to push the tongue against a metallic disc with the lips positioned around a cylinder, and to resist the force. To measure lip strength, the patient was asked to keep his lips around a button with a string attached to it on which the examiner pulled. Scores ranged from 0 (no strength) to 0.5 mV (normal strength).

They also found that comorbidity can have a substantial impact on HRQOL, and stated that the presence of comorbidity limits the ability to attribute HRQOL deficits to one specific disease (e.g., to head and neck cancer).

In our study on patients with oral or oropharyngeal carcinomas before treatment, comorbidity was present in 60% of the patients, and proved to have a major impact on HRQOL and functional status. Patients with comorbidity had significantly worse scores on several general and head and neck specific quality of life aspects and on speech and oral function tests compared to patients without comorbidity. Unfortunately, the cause of comorbidity was not systematically noted in the present study; future studies may provide more insight into the relation between the cause of comorbidity and HRQOL.

In conclusion, we observed compromised HRQOL and functional deficits among patients with advanced oral and oropharyngeal cancer before the start of treatment. In addition to the impact of tumor site and classification, comorbidity proved to have a major impact on HRQOL and functional status. Prospective studies are needed to obtain insight into the relation between pretreatment HRQOL and functional status and outcome after treatment, and the relationship between changes in HRQOL and functioning over time and tumor site, tumor classification, and comorbid conditions.
