We applied spFRET microscopy for direct observation of intranucleosomal DNA dynamics. Mononucleosomes, reconstituted with DNA containing a FRET pair at the dyad axis and exit of the nucleosome core particle, were immobilized through a 30 bp DNA tether on a polyethyleneglycol functionalized slide and visualized using Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence microscopy. FRET efficiency time-traces revealed two types of dynamics: acceptor blinking and intramolecular rearrangements. Both Cy5 and ATTO647N acceptor dyes showed severe blinking in a deoxygenated buffer in the presence of 2% βME. Replacing the triplet quencher βME with 1 mM Trolox eliminated most blinking effects. After suppression of blinking three subpopulations were observed: 90% appeared as dissociated complexes; the remaining 10% featured an average FRET efficiency in agreement with intact nucleosomes. In 97% of these intact nucleosomes no significant changes in FRET efficiency were observed in the experimentally accessible time window ranging from 10 ms to 10’s of seconds. However, 3% of the intact nucleosomes showed intervals with reduced FRET efficiency, clearly distinct from blinking, with a lifetime of 120 ms. These fluctuations can unambiguously be attributed to DNA breathing. Our findings illustrate not only the merits but also typical caveats encountered in single-molecule FRET studies on complex biological systems.

Although the conceptual beauty of FRET studies is undisputed, there are a number of important caveats in single-molecule FRET studies of biomolecules, such as fluorophore blinking, photobleaching and sample immobilization. Here, we addressed these issues. spFRET microscopy on mononucleosomes revealed two dominant types of dynamics: acceptor blinking and intramolecular rearrangements that we attribute to DNA breathing, which only became apparent after suppression of blinking. Upon immobilization, we observed three different populations: 90% of the nucleosomes dissociated or represented donor-only species, and 10% remained intact. Of these fully wrapped nucleosomes, 97% showed stable FRET on timescales between 0.01–10 s, while 3% showed dynamics with a dwell time of 120 ms that we attribute to conformational changes in the nucleosome.

Nucleosome reconstitution
Recombinant histone octamers were mixed with the DNA construct at a 1:1 ratio, in TE (1 mM EDTA, 10 mM TRIS pH 8.0) and 2 M NaCl. Mononucleosomes were reconstituted by salt dialysis against 0.85, 0.65, 0.5 and finally against 0.1 M NaCl, all buffered with TE.

On the 10% immobilized mononucleosomes showing FRET, irreversible loss of FRET was only found after photobleaching, implying that their nucleosomal structure remained intact after immobilization.

b. After deinterleaving the data into two time-traces, one for green excitation and one for red excitation, it became obvious that the fluorescence intensity of the acceptor upon direct excitation correlated perfectly with the enhanced emission of the acceptor due to FRET. Thus, the low FRET state must be attributed to blinking, due to a dark-state level of the acceptor. Further evidence that these fluctuations were caused by acceptor blinking was provided by experiments with alternative acceptor dye (ATTO647N, emission spectrum similar to Cy5). Alternating excitation of the acceptor dye revealed a strong positive correlation between sensitized emission of the acceptor and direct excitation of the acceptor. In this case the low FRET state was also present, but with a much shorter lifetime of 0.046 s. In conclusion, our data confirm that the fluctuations between a high and a low FRET state reflect photophysical processes in the acceptor dye rather than nucleosome conformational changes.

 respectively. We found that the total measured noise was significantly (typically 1.5 times) higher than that predicted by photon statistics and camera noise only. This implied that the traces contained dynamic events that cannot be fully resolved, originating from either photophysical processes (short blinking events, or intersystem crossing), or fast nucleosome dynamics. Hence, to accurately capture these events, blinking had to be further suppressed, and the sampling frequency had to be increased.

c and d. Both for Cy5 and ATTO647N blinking was dramatically suppressed in the presence of 1 to 2 mM Trolox: over 90% of the traces showed no observable blinking. Noise analyses of the intensity fluctuations in most of these traces were fully accounted for by camera noise and photon statistics (shot noise) only. Thus, within our time resolution (10 ms), no effect of short time scale blinking, or inter system crossing, was detected.

c and d. Because the lifetime of these blinking events was on the order of the smallest sampling time used, blinking events were not identified by alternating excitation of the acceptor dye, but only by FRET efficiencies below the noise threshold. Direct excitation of the acceptor did only reveal some occasional blinking in the acceptor traces, with the same lifetime of 13–14 ms. To confirm that a small but finite amount of fast blinking still occurred in the presence of Trolox, we performed spFRET measurements on a FRET pair that was separated by 11 basepair duplex DNA. This construct does not exhibit structural changes that affect the FRET intensity. In this case we also observed a small, but finite amount of blinking in a number of traces (data not shown), with a lifetime similar to that measured on mononucleosomes.

], despite the very different location of the labels in the nucleosome, and probably less important, the different DNA sequence and origin of the histones. However, we observed a very similar lifetime (∼130 ms) for Cy5 blinking under comparable buffer conditions (2% βME). The FRET efficiency of the open states in our experiments was significantly above the detection threshold, so we can explicitly exclude photophysics as the origin of the observed changes in FRET efficiency.
Our single-molecule measurements revealed at least three subpopulations in the reconstituted and immobilized nucleosome sample: 90% of the fluorophores represented dissociated nucleosomes or donor only species, 10% represented intact nucleosomes. Of these, 97% remained stable on time-scales ranging from 10 ms to 10 s of seconds, while 3% showed intervals with reduced FRET efficiency and a lifetime of 120 ms clearly distinct from blinking.

]. Because of the internal position of the labels they used, at least 50 bp of DNA had to be detached from the histone core before FRET was completely lost. We labeled the DNA at the very end of the histone bound part, and accordingly a detachment of 10–20 bp of DNA would already result in complete loss of FRET. Furthermore, the exterior part of the DNA is largely constrained by the mobile H2A–H2B dimer, whereas the labeled part of the DNA in the nucleosomes used by Tomschik et al. is mostly constrained by the more stable H3–H4 tetramer.

 an unwrapping lifetime of 10–50 ms. The 3% of our traces that showed dynamics typically featured multiple unwrapping events before photobleaching. Though photobleaching obstructs quantification of the unwrapping rate, it is of the same order of magnitude as observed by Li et al. The lifetime of the unwrapped state we observed is five to ten times larger. This discrepancy may in part be explained by differences in experimental conditions and nucleosome constructs; we can however not exclude the possibility that we overlook short-lived unwrapped states, biasing our data to a longer lifetime.

]. Two possible explanations could account for this difference: (1) The most frequently occurring DNA unwrapping occurs at a rate that exceeds the time resolution of our experiment. The rare dynamics (3%) that we observe would reflect the release of multiple histone-DNA contacts, a process that would occur less often and on longer time scales than unwrapping of only the first DNA-octamer. However, unwrapping of 10–20 bp of DNA would induce a more dramatic reduction in FRET efficiency than the reduction we observed, which is consistent with unwrapping of 10 bp or less. (2) The immobilized nucleosomes did not undergo breathing dynamics. It should be kept in mind that because of the disruption of 90% of the nucleosome upon immobilization, we only probed a subset of nucleosomes that do not dissociate upon immobilization. These nucleosomes could either be resistant to unwrapping of the DNA, or immobilized in such a way that DNA dynamics are inhibited due to interactions with the surface, while still retaining proper folding. In either case, immobilization is expected to have major impact on nucleosome dynamics, emphasizing the need for a more inert immobilization than point attachment to a PEG coated surface.
Our findings demonstrate that experimental conditions can have a profound impact on the data obtained when probing nucleosome structure and conformational dynamics. Immobilization effects and blinking dynamics have to be accounted for, and where possible suppressed in order to extract biologically relevant data from spFRET experiments. We have shown that DNA breathing kinetics obtained from carefully optimized spFRET experiments approaches values obtained from bulk experiments, opening the way to more complex single-molecule studies of chromatin dynamics.
