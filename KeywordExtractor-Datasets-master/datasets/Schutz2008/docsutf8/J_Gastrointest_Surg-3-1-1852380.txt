Massive arterial hemorrhage is, although unusual, a life-threatening complication of major pancreatobiliary surgery. Records of 351 patients who underwent major surgery for malignant pancreatobiliary disease were reviewed in this series. Thirteen patients (3.7%) experienced massive hemorrhage after surgery. Complete hemostasis by transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) or re-laparotomy was achieved in five patients and one patient, respectively. However, 7 of 13 cases ended in fatality, which is a 54% mortality rate. Among six survivors, one underwent selective TAE for a pseudoaneurysm of the right hepatic artery (RHA). Three patients underwent TAE proximal to the proper hepatic artery (PHA): hepatic inflow was maintained by successful TAE of the gastroduodenal artery in two and via a well-developed subphrenic artery in one. One patient had TAE of the celiac axis for a pseudoaneurysm of the splenic artery (SPA), and hepatic inflow was maintained by the arcades around the pancreatic head. One patient who experienced a pseudoaneurysm of the RHA after left hemihepatectomy successfully underwent re-laparotomy, ligation of RHA, and creation of an ileocolic arterioportal shunt. In contrast, four of seven patients with fatal outcomes experienced hepatic infarction following TAE proximal to the PHA or injury of the common hepatic artery during angiography. One patient who underwent a major hepatectomy for hilar bile duct cancer had a recurrent hemorrhage after TAE of the gastroduodenal artery and experienced hepatic failure. In the two patients with a pseudoaneurysm of the SPA or the superior mesenteric artery, an emergency re-laparotomy was required to obtain hemostasis because of worsening clinical status. Selective TAE distal to PHA or in the SPA is usually successful. TAE proximal to PHA must be restricted to cases where collateral hepatic blood flow exists. Otherwise or for a pseudoaneurysm of the superior mesenteric artery, endovascular stenting, temporary creation of an ileocolic arterioportal shunt, or vascular reconstruction by re-laparotomy is an alternative.

 We reviewed the records of patients who experienced massive arterial hemorrhage after pancreatobiliary surgery to help generate guidelines for the management of postoperative pseudoaneurysm rupture.

 = 19). Procedures included pylorus-preserving pancreatoduodenectomy (PPPD) in 113, conventional pancreatoduodenectomy (PD) in 84, distal pancreatectomy (DP) in 35, segmental resection of the pancreas in 4, total pancreatectomy in 6, bile duct resection with partial hepatectomy in 98, and PD combined with partial hepatectomy (HPD) in 11. Patients undergoing isolated bile duct resection or partial hepatectomy without bile duct resection were excluded. Except for the patients who underwent DP, all patients received biliary tract reconstruction and skeletonization of the hepatic arteries to complete lymphadenectomy within the hepatoduodenal ligament. Pancreatojejunostomy was created as an end-to-side, duct-to-mucosa anastomosis with a stenting tube, or via the pancreatic duct insertion technique with total tube drainage when the pancreatic duct was smaller than 3 mm. Hepaticojejunostomy was created end-to-side in a single layer.
Massive postoperative arterial hemorrhage was defined as bleeding requiring a transfusion of 2 or more units of packed red blood cells, an invasive intervention such as laparotomy or TAE and monitoring in the surgical intensive care unit within 24 h of the onset of hemorrhage. The medical records of these patients were analyzed retrospectively.

After restoration of hemodynamic stability by volume loading, 10 of 13 patients underwent emergency pan-abdominal angiography visualizing the celiac axis (CA) and superior mesenteric artery (SMA) by standard Seldinger technique. The other three patients required emergency laparotomy without angiography because their clinical status was deteriorating.

 details the origin of bleeding and the sites of TAE. Complete hemostasis was achieved by TAE in five patients, but hemostasis was only temporary in four: two required a second TAE and two required laparotomy to control rebleeding.
Of the three patients with a pseudoaneurysm distal to the PHA, one received selective TAE of the RHA with a successful outcome (patient 1). A second patient had recurrent hemorrhage after TAE of the RHA and second TAE of the PHA was required. Unfortunately, the cluster of coils compressed the portal vein and portal flow was disrupted after the second TAE. This patient died of hepatic failure secondary to hepatic hypoperfusion (patient 2). The third patient had undergone extended left hepatectomy with resection of the RHA and had bleeding from the site of the RHA reconstruction (patient 3). If TAE had been performed at the RHA, inflow to the small remnant liver would be completely interrupted, and fatal hepatic failure would have been the most likely outcome. Instead, we re-operated, ligated the RHA, and created an ileocolic arterioportal shunt to supply the hepatic remnant. The patient survived without hepatic failure. However, portal hypertension developed because this shunt remained patent 6 months after reoperation, and the patient died of spinal metastasis 11 months after the initial operation.

One patient with a pseudoaneurysm of the SMA underwent surgical resection with vascular reconstruction. However, the patient died of recurrent pancreatic cancer and multiple organ failure during the hospital stay (patient 13).
Seven of 13 patients died in the hospital; thus, the mortality rate for massive arterial hemorrhage was 54%, and the overall mortality rate was 2.0%.

 but this is an unusual source of bleeding after pancreatobiliary surgery. Selective TAE is indicated because ischemia of the spleen is rare. However, when the origin of the pseudoaneurysm is close to the CA, selective TAE proximal to the SPA is as difficult as the case of bleeding from the GDA. Therefore, when the SPA is divided in surgery, it may be better to leave the proximal part of the ligation site in some degree. TAE of the CA is contraindicated as it will completely interrupt hepatic arterial flow in most cases (patient 11).
When the origin of a pseudoaneurysm is the SMA, it may be extremely difficult or even impossible to preserve mesenteric arterial flow. Hence, resection of the pseudoaneurysm with vascular reconstruction is indicated (patient 11). Endovascular stenting may be an alternative deserving further study.
