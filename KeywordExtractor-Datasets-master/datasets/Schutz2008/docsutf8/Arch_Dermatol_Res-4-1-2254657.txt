Infliximab is a monoclonal antibody directed against TNF-α. It has been approved for use in rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, inflammatory bowel disease, psoriatic arthritis and plaque-type psoriasis. In case reports, positive effects on pustular variants of psoriasis have also been reported. However, paradoxically, manifestation of pustular psoriasis and plaque-type psoriasis has been reported in patients treated with TNF antagonists including infliximab for other indications. Here, we report on 5 patients with chronic plaque-type psoriasis who developed palmoplantar pustulosis during or after discontinuation of infliximab therapy. In two of the five cases, manifestation of palmoplantar pustulosis was not accompanied by worsening of plaque-type psoriasis. Possibly, site-specific factors or a differential contribution of immunological processes modulated by TNF inhibitors to palmoplantar pustulosis and plaque-type psoriasis may have played a role.

]. Because this type of pustular psoriasis is believed to correspond to an extreme activation of psoriatic disease mechanisms, the high bioavailability of infliximab and its rapid onset of action following intravenous infusion have been used to explain the surprisingly fast decrease of pustule formation in patients treated with the agent. Paradoxically, on the other hand, manifestation of pustular psoriasis has been reported in patients treated with TNF antagonists including infliximab for other indications.

]. This patient later experienced a relapse of PPP when treatment with etanercept was initiated, which also suggests that a class effect of TNF-antagonists may play a role.
In two of the three cases in whom an exacerbation of plaque-psoriasis occurred parallel to the manifestation of PPP, typical trigger factors for active psoriasis could be identified such as an infection (case 3) and the abrupt termination of anti-psoriatic treatment (case 2). These two cases are compatible with the existence of common trigger factors for plaque psoriasis and PPP. What are other factors that might contribute to the development of PPP during treatment of psoriasis vulgaris? While the exact etiology of PPP remains to be established, a history of smoking is the most important known risk factor for PPP. However, only one out of the three patients in whom a smoking history had been obtained was a smoker at the time of onset of pustular psoriasis (case 3). Streptococcal infection, a known risk factor for psoriasis vulgaris, has not been established as a risk factor for PPP and probably plays a minor role there. However, in the cases presented here, one patient (case 3) suffered an upper respiratory tract infection a few days before manifestation of PPP, while another patient (case 1) had suffered from a persistent cold 6 weeks before manifestation of pustules. In the former patient, the close temporal relationship between infectious symptoms and manifestation of PPP may point to a possible contribution of the infection to triggering PPP, and a modulation of the immune response to infliximab appears possible.

], it is likely that TNF-antagonists may in some individuals and probably in conjunction with environmental factors favor manifestation or worsening of psoriatic skin and/or bone disease.
The treatment of patients with plaque-psoriasis developing PPP should be decided on an individual basis. In case plaque-psoriasis remains controlled under infliximab therapy, addition of topical therapy may be sufficient for treatment of PPP in some instances (case 4). However, in some cases, additional topical therapy may not be sufficient and UV-therapy or another systemic therapy may be necessary in addition to or as replacement of infliximab therapy (case 3). When manifestation of PPP is accompanied by worsening of plaque-psoriasis, discontinuation of infliximab therapy is advisable and initiation of other systemic antipsoriatic agents, such as cyclosporine or a different TNF-antagonist, may be necessary (cases 1 and 5).
In summary, pustular psoriasis may show a good response to treatment with TNF-antagonists such as infliximab. However, pustular psoriasis may also manifest during treatment of rheumatological diseases, and, as described here, also in patients with plaque-type psoriasis under treatment with infliximab. Manifestation of PPP under infliximab is not necessarily accompanied by worsening of pre-existing plaque psoriasis. Management of the pustular skin lesions has to be decided on an individual basis. In a subgroup of patients, therapy with the TNF-antagonist has to be discontinued and another systemic therapy (including a different TNF-antagonist) will probably be necessary to sufficiently control plaque-psoriasis and PPP.
