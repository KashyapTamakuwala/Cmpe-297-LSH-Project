This review on platelet research focuses on defects of adhesion, cytoskeletal organisation, signal transduction and secretion. Platelet defects can be studied by different laboratory platelet functional assays and morphological studies. Easy bruising or a suspected platelet-based bleeding disorder is of course the most obvious reason to test the platelet function in a patient. However, nowadays platelet research also contributes to our understanding of human pathology in other disciplines such as neurology, nephrology, endocrinology and metabolic diseases. Apart from a discussion on classical thrombopathies, this review will also deal with the less commonly known relation between platelet research and disorders with a broader clinical phenotype. Classical thrombopathies involve disorders of platelet adhesion such as Glanzmann thrombastenia and Bernard-Soulier syndrome, defective G protein signalling diseases with impaired phospholipase C activation, and abnormal platelet granule secretion disorders such as gray platelet disorder and delta-storage pool disease. Other clinical symptoms besides a bleeding tendency have been described in MYH9-related disorders and Duchenne muscular dystrophy due to adhesion defects, and also in disorders of impaired Gs signalling, in Hermansky Pudlack disease and Chediak Higashi disease with abnormal secretion. Finally, platelet research can also be used to unravel novel mechanisms involved in many neurological disorders such as depression and autism with only a subclinical platelet defect.

b). Stimulation of Gq by different ligands such as adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and thromboxane A2 (TXA2) results in platelet activation by stimulating phospholipase C and a release of calcium from the intracellular stores. This platelet activation process is enhanced when Gi is activated and inhibited when Gs is activated both by modulating the intracellular cAMP level.

Functional and morphological platelet studies in patients with mainly a neurological, metabolic or another clinical problem but no obvious bleeding problem are usually not performed for diagnostic purposes but rather for research aims. In such patients, novel insights are expected to result from the platelet research studies, which are still preliminary today but in the future hopefully will help to better define when to ask for what type of platelet tests in a given patient.

Why patients with May-Hegglin anomaly, Fechtner syndrome, Epstein syndrome and Sebastian platelet syndrome have different signs and symptoms in other tissues than their common defect in platelets still remains to be elucidated.

The VPAC1 signalling pathway also mediates megakaryocyte maturation and platelet formation (unpublished results). Patients with PACAP overexpression have a mild thrombocytopenia, a normal platelet survival, relatively small platelets and their bone marrow examination reveals almost no mature megakaryocytes.

]. Major advances are expected of platelet research for this field in the near future since it is now obvious that besides the serotonin pathway, which was only the tip of the iceberg, many other pathways are chaired between platelets and neurons as well as the many gene products responsible for the regulation of granule formation, transport, secretion and endocytosis.

Conclusions
Platelet research is an expanding field originally studying isolated thrombopathies caused by the imbalance between thrombosis and hemostasis but more recently being able to bring novel insights in our understanding of human pathology in other clinical disciplines such as neurology, endocrinology and metabolic diseases. Platelets are easily accessible cells, and different techniques are possible to study platelet function and morphology under basal and activated conditions. Defects in platelet adhesion, G protein signalling and secretion can result from mutations in platelet-specific genes leading to isolated thrombopathies or from mutations in widely expressed genes leading to broader clinical phenotype including a platelet defect. In addition to using platelet research for diagnostic purposes, these platelet functional and morphological studies can also be used for research aims. From the close collaboration between clinicians of different disciplines, geneticists and the functional platelet research unit, novel insights in the pathogenesis of different human disorders are to be expected in the near future by using this strategy.
