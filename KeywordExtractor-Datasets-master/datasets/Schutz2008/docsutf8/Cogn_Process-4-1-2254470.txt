Working memory (WM), including a ‘central executive’, is used to guide behavior by internal goals or intentions. We suggest that WM is best described as a set of three interdependent functions which are implemented in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). These functions are maintenance, control of attention and integration. A model for the maintenance function is presented, and we will argue that this model can be extended to incorporate the other functions as well. Maintenance is the capacity to briefly maintain information in the absence of corresponding input, and even in the face of distracting information. We will argue that maintenance is based on recurrent loops between PFC and posterior parts of the brain, and probably within PFC as well. In these loops information can be held temporarily in an active form. We show that a model based on these structural ideas is capable of maintaining a limited number of neural patterns. Not the size, but the coherence of patterns (i.e., a chunking principle based on synchronous firing of interconnected cell assemblies) determines the maintenance capacity. A mechanism that optimizes coherent pattern segregation, also poses a limit to the number of assemblies (about four) that can concurrently reverberate. Top-down attentional control (in perception, action and memory retrieval) can be modelled by the modulation and re-entry of top-down information to posterior parts of the brain. Hierarchically organized modules in PFC create the possibility for information integration. We argue that large-scale multimodal integration of information creates an ‘episodic buffer’, and may even suffice for implementing a central executive.

Introduction
When we return home from work we sometimes find ourselves deeply engaged in thinking about an unsolved problem. Yet, at the same time we manage to find our way home and avoid accidents. This indicates that apparently we are able to automatically control our behavior without needing conscious attention. If suddenly an obstacle appears, however, we are also able to switch attention in a split second. Given the right cues, we may also remember that in the morning we planned to do some shopping on the way home. That too would put solving the problem to a halt and bring us to figure out the best route to the shop. This shows that control may be taken over by retrieving a plan, and that in order to carry it out we need access to a large database, including a route planner. If later on we resume thinking about the problem, we may figure out a solution by combining known elements in a novel configuration, and then start thinking how to use it in the future.
The description given above is an example of the coordinated and goal-directed thoughts and actions that are generated in our brains all the time. Clearly, such coordinated behavior requires a versatile system of cognitive control for which as yet there does not seem to exist an adequate concept. Some of the contours of such a control system, however, are discernable in the example given above, like the ability to maintain representations, to direct attention and to combine previously unrelated information.

), an episodic buffer was added to connect working memory with long-term memory and to allow binding together information from different sources into integrated episodes. The central executive is the most important but least understood component of WM, and it looks conspicuously like a homunculus. Baddeley is well aware of this criticism, but he defends the central executive concept by pointing out that it defines a problem area for which the processes have to be specified.
1986
). They proposed a ‘data base system’ for automatic habitual action routines, containing well-learned stimulus-response associations and cognitive and behavioral skills, and a ‘supervisory attentional system’ capable of controlling behavior by selectively biasing and reconfiguring the available skills and schemas. Automatic control develops gradually through practice as learning processes create associative pathways between perception and action. The conscious form of control is applied when we are confronted by novel and unexpected stimuli, and when we have the intention to attain specific goals. In this case, automatic actions to stimulus patterns in the environment have to be suppressed and replaced by novel task- and goal-directed actions.

More specifically, we suggested that the development of PFC created the possibility to maintain physically absent information in an active state by recurrent connections (loops) between PFC and the rest of the cortex. The recurrent activity in these loops may affect subsequent perceptual and motor processing, i.e., it can redirect attention and control actions by activating or inhibiting particular motor programs. By assuming interactions and integration between loops, more complex forms of representation and control may develop. For instance, recurrent connections with memory systems would allow access to all stored information, and mechanisms for combining information in the loops would allow the formation and updating of future goal states, and ways to achieve them.

). They proposed a distinction between short-term storage and two executive processes, selective attention and task management.
In this paper we will first discuss the neuroanatomical correlates of these hypothesized interdependent working memory functions. Then we will present a neural model for binding and segregation in working memory to simulate the maintenance function. This model is based on recent ideas about synchronization of activation patterns in networks and it is able to explain capacity limitations of maintenance in WM. Next, extensions of this model will be discussed to realize the attentional control mechanism. It is suggested that modulatory effects within PFC may selectively enhance or suppress representations in posterior cortex by recurrent connections. Finally, we will present some ideas on how to realize integration and manipulation functions, given that large-scale multi-modal integration is necessary to explain coherence and coordination of behavior.

Neuroanatomical correlates of working memory in PFC

). Much effort has been invested in finding functional specializations within the PFC, i.e., the extent that different areas or modules of PFC are selectively involved in encoding particular types of information (e.g., verbal versus visual), or in implementing various processing functions (e.g., maintenance versus attentional control).

), do not include the PFC as a representational medium.
The suggestion that PFC implements WM functions, but is not itself involved in associative learning, would fit the requirement that it is maximally flexible in the service of generating novel combinations of representations that are stored somewhere else. There are no indications, however, that the neural architecture and processes of the PFC differ fundamentally from those in posterior cortex which intrinsically generate a learning capacity. Therefore, some learning (and representational) capacity in PFC cannot be ruled out a priori.

). Although in all of these studies a number of learning trials precedes the development of task specific activation patterns, the speed and flexibility of the adaptation process seems more suggestive of an adaptive coding than of an associative learning process.
1999
), for example, suggested that the information that is maintained in WM consists of activation patterns in PFC that are sustained by strong mutual excitation of the neurons involved. To explain the flexibility in combining these representations without losing their specificity, they assumed that PFC representations had to be relatively isolated from each other. Therefore, learning in PFC was supposed to be slow, taking place over many years, and eventually producing a rich palette of independent PFC representations that enable flexible problem-solving skills. Such representations might have a hierarchical structure with an increasing level of abstraction along a posterior-anterior PFC axis, probably with the most posterior PFC representations being closely connected to detailed memory representations in posterior cortex.

), rather than the need to update connection weights. Although the simple tasks simulated in this model may also apply to more realistic and complex rules, the authors point out that it still leaves unexplained how PFC representations can be dynamically recombined and can interact with other systems (such as episodic memory, language and affect).
It remains to be seen whether the supposed PFC learning mechanism is viable. Over brief periods of time, learning probably does not play a major role, but a role of learning over extensive periods cannot be ruled out.

), there are two seemingly incompatible core requirements of working memory. The first is to robustly maintain goals and task instructions over time even when faced with strong interference. The second is to rapidly and flexibly update goals and tasks if circumstances change. Their solution to combine robust maintenance with flexible updating has been to assume a dopamine gating mechanism. Under tonic dopamine levels a strong mutual excitation within a cell assembly would lead to sustained activity and resistance to interference by irrelevant input. Phasic shifts of dopamine levels induced by significant events (e.g., success or failure in a task or novel stimuli predicting reward) would enhance the strength of afferent input and cause updating of the activation state, which subsequently may lead to representing novel strategies, rules, goals or task states.
Although a dopamine-gating mechanism is an interesting possibility, we believe that re-entry of activation through recurrent neuronal circuits is the main mechanism for the maintenance function of WM. It is likely that there are many of such recurrent loops for different types of information. These loops link the perceptual, memory and motor representational areas in posterior cortex to PFC. They feed information into PFC and, in turn, are activated by the recurrent activation from PFC. Modulating activity in these loops by other PFC sources would modulate the top-down recurrency. We also suggest and that these loops form a hierarchy, at the lowest level maintaining simple stimuli or features and at higher levels maintaining increasingly complex stimulus relations and rules. We will show how this idea can be implemented and explore the feasibility of such an implementation. We agree, however, that especially for the highest and most global or integrative levels of maintaining information, a dopamine gating mechanism for auto-associative maintenance cannot be ruled out.

Attentional control

Evidence for such a role comes, for instance, from findings showing that an important characteristic of behavioral deficits following damage to the PFC is extreme distractability (i.e., an inability to suppress interfering information) and disinhibition (i.e., an inability to suppress inappropriate responses).

He argued that a cascaded control model, assuming several nested levels of control, with a highly integrative system at the top, may explain neuropsychological results showing that damage to the top system only affects tasks that require a high degree of information integration (e.g., planning and problem solving), but does not interfere with tasks that can be executed at a lower level of control.

A neurocomputational model of maintenance, control and integration
2001
), we have presented a model for the temporary holding in (visual) working memory of a limited number of neural patterns, simulating either single features or integrated objects. The model implemented a cortical mechanism of maintenance in a network of model neurons with biologically plausible parameters. Although the model implemented a visual working memory system, the principles may be applicable to any form of information or type of working memory.
In the model WM was assumed to be based on recurrent connections between IT cortex containing representations of objects or features, and corresponding neurons in PFC. The IT representations were modelled as strongly associated neural assemblies that generate synchronized firing patterns when activated by external input. The simultaneous activation of independent assemblies in IT causes competition via inhibitory interneurons. Due to the neuron characteristics, this leads to desynchronization among the activation patterns of competing assemblies resulting in a sustained phase-locked activation of multiple assemblies over time.

). The vlPFC module is a set of 20 assemblies of neurons, with a coding structure “matching” the IT module structure. For simplicity, each IT assembly is recurrently connected with one vlPFC assembly, with a signaling delay of 15 ms in both directions. The vlPFC assemblies coding for a given chunk are reciprocally connected with a dlPFC assembly, which propagates synchronous firing before Hebbian learning takes place in the IT module




In the IT module, strong connections are implemented within and weak connections between assemblies coding different ‘stimuli’. We also implemented a global inhibition (competition) mechanism between IT assemblies. This circuitry, in which a given assembly is inhibited by the firing of the other assemblies in the IT module, mediates an active desynchronization mechanism.

) also hold at the level of single neurons, thus pointing out the robustness of the observed effects. The use of single neurons instead of assemblies of tens of neurons, is also motivated by the sake of running relatively fast simulations with a smaller time-step in numerical integration of neuronal equations (higher computational accuracy) than in our previous investigations.
The model, of course, is very simplified with respect to the complexity of the real cortical networks. Feedback from the vlPFC module does no more than maintaining the oscillatory state of IT assemblies after the stimulus offset. More realistic network versions might include “closed” reverberatory circuits within prefrontal areas, making prefrontal assemblies independent from the IT assemblies in maintaining the delay activity. This would allow modality shifts by activating other prefrontal assemblies, which in turn would trigger reverberatory circuitries in lower cortical areas, in the absence of actual physical stimulation. Moreover, we used a simplified one-to-one matching between IT and vlPFC assemblies, whereas it seems more realistic to assume that prefrontal assemblies are relatively non-specific, thus being connected to multiple sets of neurons in posterior areas. Instead of the one-to-one matching of assemblies, dlPFC neurons might simply send back activation to all vlPFC neurons, and these in turn to all IT neurons from which they receive activation. However, the present simple architecture is sufficient for demonstrating the functional principles we have specified earlier.

A series of follow-up simulations showed that the probability of item retention depends on the relative biasing top-down input for a given item. A strong attentional input to one or two items may ‘narrow’ visual working memory capacity to one or two highly focused elements, due to the higher firing rate (e.g. bursting) of the neurons coding for the focused items.

). In order to account for the retention of integrated units in visual working memory, in previous simulations we defined units by assuming already established chunking fields, i.e. pre-existing associative connections between IT neurons, coding different features of the same unit. A major problem, however, is how ‘chunking fields’ or integrated representations in long-term memory are formed, i.e. how associative Hebbian learning may take place in the simulated cortical circuits of (visual) working memory. This learning process should operate against the phase-segregation tendency due to mutual desynchronizing inhibition. In the present model, the dlPFC module may perform this temporary synchronization control processes.

Control simulations with the same model and learning parameters, showed that a relatively high number of simultaneous presentations of initially independent elements, may slowly give rise to novel chunks with a variable degree of stability, even in the absence of feedback from dlPFC to vlPFC. This slow chunk-learning process may be related to an implicit learning process, rather than the more rapid process of controlled chunk formation by feedback from dlPFC.


Discussion
2001
) concluded that PFC is critical when top-down control of processing is needed for the guidance of behavior by internal states or intentions. In this paper we conjecture that such control is possible by assuming that the PFC is a brain system that is reciprocally connected to posterior parts of the brain and therefore capable of modulating direct perception-action relations. We argued that three interdependent functions are required for such control: maintenance of activation patterns even in the face of distraction, large scale integration of information from different sources, and top-down selective attention. We also showed that these functions can be simulated, at least in principle, with a biologically plausible model assuming recurrent connections and a hierarchical structure of PFC. Importantly, the functions were simulated using a single framework consisting of a hierarchy of recurrently connected modules. This framework proved capable of maintaining a limited number of mutually desynchronized patterns, of controlling selective attention by top-down modulatory signals, and of high level integration by top-down synchronization of the activity of independent patterns.

2003
). In the latest version of this model an additional component, an episodic buffer, was proposed. This component was thought necessary to explain interactions between working memory and LTM, for example to explain how chunking may supplement the capacity for immediate serial recall. A continuous interaction between working memory and LTM is a basic assumption in our model, and we have shown that chunking is a natural consequence of this interaction.
2003
), the episodic buffer allows information from different systems to be integrated, and it may be regarded as the ‘storage component of the executive’. Moreover, Baddeley suggested that the buffer is a separate temporary store in which long-term memory information is downloaded in order to be manipulated and used for creating new representations. In our view, the structure of such an episodic buffer would actually be a hierarchy of PFC modules maintaining and integrating information at successively higher levels. Information is not copied and downloaded in PFC, but selected task-relevant perceptual and memory information in posterior cortical areas is kept in an active state by recurrent loops. We assume that at the highest integration levels, presumably located in anterior and dorsolateral areas of PFC, information can be integrated over space and time. At this level, general goals, and plans to achieve them, would be generated. We suggest that this may be the implementation of an episodic buffer and even of a central executive. The creation of short-term and long-term goals at high levels of integration, allows to control behavior by top-down regulation of activation in subordinate modules and eventually by modulating perception-action systems. Current goals and tasks would have to be maintained here in order to control ongoing behavior. More distant goals, however, may be stored in LTM to be retrieved later on.
We do not imply that control is always hierarchical. Because the PFC is assumed to be a modulatory system, simple tasks may be executed automatically without PFC involvement. Only controlled processing requires modulation of automatic processes by PFC feedback. Also here, however, control does not need to be completely hierarchical. Depending on the type and complexity of a task, control may be executed by specialized modules at subordinate levels. Automatic processing and controlled processing under the guidance of subordinate levels in PFC, is a requirement to free higher integrative areas to engage in the kind of simulated actions and perceptions, and using anticipated outcomes, that are the contents of conscious thought and planning.
So there are things we can do automatically, using previously established associations between perceptual events and effective responses, and there are things we can do in a controlled way, using the possibility of PFC to modulate and thus control perception and action. The possibility of PFC to work off-line, to use and integrate all present and past knowledge for creating virtual worlds and for making plans and carry them out if conditions are appropriate, has generated a tremendously flexible potential for control. The model we propose is vastly insufficient to simulate such cognitive feats that we engage in daily. We believe, however, that the principles for a controlling system we have suggested may be a first step towards a better understanding of what is until now a cognitive Terra Incognita.
