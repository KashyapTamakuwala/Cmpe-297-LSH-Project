Introduction
Friedman, 1993; Gressner, 1995; Lieber, 1999
). The main causes of liver fibrosis are infection with hepatitis B or C, alcohol abuse, and non-alcohol steatohepatitis. There are over 100 million people with hepatic fibrosis in the world.

Therefore, in the present study, we evaluated the effects of fucoidan on hepatic injury and fibrosis. We found that fucoidan may be useful as a novel type of anti-fibrotic agent.

 was dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide at 100 mM.

2.2
Animals and experimental protocols
All of the experimental protocols conformed to the ethics guidelines of the Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Osaka University. Male Sprague–Dawley rats (200–250 g) and male ddy mice (6 weeks old) were obtained from SLC (Shizuoka, Japan). The mice were housed in an environmentally controlled room (lights on from 8:00 to 20:00; temperature, 23 ±1.5 °C). Animals had free access to water and commercial chow (Type MF, Oriental Yeast, Tokyo, Japan).

 (0.3 ml/kg body weight) and fucoidan (50 mg/kg body weight) were administered orally and intravenously, respectively, to mice twice a week for 8 weeks. The liver and blood were recovered from the mice under anesthesia. The serum was separated from the blood and stored at − 20 °C before assay.

2.3
Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) assays
Serum AST and ALT levels were measured using commercially available kits (Mitsubishi Kagaku Iatron Inc., Tokyo, Japan) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

2.4
Analysis of fibrosis
Liver specimens were fixed with 10% formaldehyde and embedded in paraffin. Tissue sections were mounted on slides, and Azan staining was performed to analyze the extent of fibrosis. After establishing a background for each micrograph, the number of pixels showing a blue color (stained collagen fibers) was determined with Scion Image (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD), and the percentage of fibrosis in the liver was calculated as the ratio of the blue-colored area to the total area of the liver.

-induced lipid peroxidation (data not shown). Taken together, our results suggest that the anti-fibrogenic activity of fucoidan is due, at least in part, to attenuation of hepatic stellate cell activation by inhibition of transforming growth factor-β and/or by scavenging of reactive oxygen species, which can suppress the cascade of events that leads to hepatic stellate cell activation.
Canbay et al., 2002; Song et al., 2003; Iredale, 2001; Iredale et al., 1998; Issa et al., 2001
). Thus, a compound that can prevent hepatocyte injury and/or induce the death of hepatic stellate cells should be useful for the treatment of hepatic fibrosis. In the current studies we showed that fucoidan reduces the growth of hepatic stellate cells and that it can protect hepatocytes from injury. We also found that the fucoidan-treated hepatic stellate cells were stained with annexin V, a marker of apoptosis (data not shown). Taken together, these findings suggest that fucoidan may be useful for treating hepatic fibrosis.

). The biological activities may differ among the various structures of pure fucoidan as well as the different components of crude fucoidan. Identification of the structures of fucoidan that protect hepatocytes from hepatotoxins and that inhibit hepatic stellate cell growth is needed for the development of fucoidan as an anti-fibrotic agent.
In summary, we found that fucoidan prevents hepatocyte cell death and induces the death of hepatic stellate cells in an animal model of hepatic fibrosis. Future studies will examine the molecular mechanisms of fucoidan in hepatocytes and hepatic stellate cells. This is the first report that fucoidan has anti-fibrotic activity and that it is a promising lead for the development of anti-fibrotic agents. Identification of the molecular target and the active structure of fucoidan may lead to the development of novel anti-fibrotic agents.
