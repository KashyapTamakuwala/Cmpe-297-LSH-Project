Background
Cytoreductive surgery (CS) followed by heated intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) is considered the standard of care for the treatment of patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC) of colorectal cancer (CRC). These surgical procedures result in a median survival of 2 years at the cost of considerable morbidity and mortality. In preclinical studies, radioimmunotherapy (RIT) improved survival after CS in a model of induced PC of colonic origin.
In the present studies we aimed to compare the efficacy and toxicity of CS followed by adjuvant RIT in experimental PC to the standard of care, HIPEC.

Methods
PC was induced by intraperitoneal inoculation of CC-531 colon carcinoma cells in three groups of Wag/Rij rats. Treatment comprised CS only, CS + RIT or CS + HIPEC, immediately after surgery. RIT consisted of intraperitoneal administration of 74 MBq Lutetium-177 labeled MG1. HIPEC was performed by a closed abdomen perfusion technique using mitomycin C (16 mg/L during 60 minutes). The primary endpoint was survival.

Conclusion
Survival after CS was significantly improved by RIT with Lutetium-177-MG1 in rats with PC of colorectal origin. Adjuvant HIPEC did not improve survival and was more toxic than adjuvant RIT.

Subsequently, CS, including a routine omentectomy, was performed in all rats. Irresectable tumor deposits were cauterized using an electrocoagulation device. After completion of the surgical cytoreduction, the abdominal wall was closed in two layers using continuous Vicryl 3/0 sutures for the muscular component and iron wound clips for the skin in animal treated with CS only or CS + RIT.

Mitomycin-C
Mitomycin-C (MMC) was obtained from Nycomed Christiaens BV (Breda, The Netherlands) as a powder in glass vial (40 mg/vial). Immediately before use, MMC was dissolved in 0.9% sodium chloride to the appropriate concentrations.

Intraperitoneal Distribution of MMC and Dose Determination
Prior to the therapy experiment with HIPEC, we investigated the intraperitoneal distribution of the perfusion fluid using a methylene blue stained perfusate. The perfusate was administered in the same fashion as in the therapeutic experiment. After completion, the abdominal cavity was inspected for the presence of blue dye in all quadrants on both parietal as well as visceral peritoneum of the intra-abdominal organs and the diaphragm. Subsequently, a study to determine the dose of MMC that resulted in acceptable toxicity was performed in nine animals (three animals per group). Animals underwent a laparotomy including an omentectomy and complete bowel inspection followed by heated perfusion of the abdominal cavity with MMC at 4 mg/L or 16 mg/L. Control rats underwent laparotomy and an omentectomy only. Body weight and physical condition were monitored during 6 days following the procedure to assess treatment-related toxicity.

Treatment Efficacy

 CC-531 tumor cells, 45 rats, 15 per treatment group, were randomly assigned to undergo either CS only, CS + RIT or CS + HIPEC. The operative procedures and application of the adjuvant therapies were performed as described previously. Toxicity of the treatment was determined clinically and by weighing the rats. Body weight was expressed as relative body weight compared with the body weight on the day of surgery. Survival was scored, and at autopsy the extent of tumor growth was determined.

-administration and immediately dissected. The HEP was determined by an experienced biotechnician who was blinded to the therapeutic regimen. At the time of the HEP rats were generally lethargic, showing signs of advanced PC as the presence of ascites. At dissection, the intraperitoneal tumor growth was scored as described previously. At 16 weeks postoperatively, the study was terminated and the remaining rats were euthanized and dissected. In case of absence of macroscopic tumor, all relevant organs, including the greater momentum, the mesentery, and the diaphragm were removed for histopathological staining to determine tumor presence microscopically. Sections were stained using hematoxylin & eosin (H&E) and/or immunohistochemical staining using the murine MG1 antibody in combination with a horse-anti-mouse IgG antibody, HRP conjugated (Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA, USA).

At the endpoint of the study, 16 weeks after CS, 14 animals (two animals in the CS group, five animals in the CS + HIPEC group, and seven animals in the CS + RIT group) were still alive, without any physical signs of intraperitoneal tumor growth.
Of these 14 animals that were still alive 16 weeks after surgery, one animal in the CS + HIPEC group and three animals in the CS + RIT group showed macroscopic evidence of tumor at dissection. In the remaining 10 animals (two in the CS alone group, four in the HIPEC group, and four in the RIT group) not even microscopic tumor presence was found.


DISCUSSION
In the present study, adjuvant radioimmunotherapy after cytoreductive surgery for peritoneal carcinomatosis of colorectal origin in rats significantly improved survival, whereas HIPEC did not. In addition, the application of HIPEC was associated with considerably more toxicity as compared to RIT.

 These data on the dose of MMC, the used perfusion time and temperature, together with our results that showed antitumor effect in the model of induced PC from CC531 cells (significantly lower PCI at HEP in favor of CS + HIPEC), we can conclude that the HIPEC model used in our study was able to induce regression of PC of colonic origin.

 In this review, the authors state that the time may have come for clinical trials in which RIT is added to standard regimens to establish the place of this treatment modality as an adjuvant treatment after CS.

 In that study, we showed that RIT should be administered as soon as possible after CS, with a window of opportunity for RIT administration up to 4 days after surgery. It can therefore be envisioned that for radiation safety reasons the therapy should be given not before discharge of the patient from ICU and removal of the abdominal drains.
Our study therefore justifies the consideration of intraperitoneal radioimmunotherapy after cytoreductive surgery in case of peritoneal carcinomatosis of colorectal cancer. In clinical studies, this approach should be compared with HIPEC.

CONCLUSION
This study showed that RIT adjuvant to CS significantly improved survival compared to CS alone in a rat model of PC of CRC, whereas the contemporary gold standard, HIPEC, did not cause a significant improvement in survival. This improvement of survival was associated with a decreased level of treatment-related toxicity compared with HIPEC. Adjuvant radioimmunotherapy might therefore be an alternative adjuvant treatment after cytoreductive surgery of PC of colorectal origin in a clinical trial setting.
