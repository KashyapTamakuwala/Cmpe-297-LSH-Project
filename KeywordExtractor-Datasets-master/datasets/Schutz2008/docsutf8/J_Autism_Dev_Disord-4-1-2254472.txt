Subjects with PDD excel on certain visuo-spatial tasks, amongst which visual search tasks, and this has been attributed to enhanced perceptual discrimination. However, an alternative explanation is that subjects with PDD show a different, more effective search strategy. The present study aimed to test both hypotheses, by measuring eye movements during visual search tasks in high functioning adult men with PDD and a control group. Subjects with PDD were significantly faster than controls in these tasks, replicating earlier findings in children. Eye movement data showed that subjects with PDD made fewer eye movements than controls. No evidence was found for a different search strategy between the groups. The data indicate an enhanced ability to discriminate between stimulus elements in PDD.

). This procedure was followed by rejection/acceptation based on minimum saccade duration of 12 ms and minimum amplitude of 1°. When a saccade was removed, fixation time before and after this saccade and the duration of the saccade were added together.

Stimulus and Task
2001
), the condition including a vertical target among tilted distracters will be referred to as the easy condition, and the condition with a tilted target (among vertical distracters) as the hard condition. Each task contained two crossed factors; set size (4, 16, or 25 items) and probe, target present or target absent. There were 30 trials at each unique combination of factors, yielding a session of 180 trials per task. The sequence of different tasks was randomised within each session. In each session, the participant was informed about the nature of the target (either vertical or tilted), but did not know when a target would be present or absent, or what the display size would be on any trial. The participants performed a binary choice RT task indicating whether a target was present or absent by a button press on each trial.

Procedure
The order in which the two conditions were presented was counterbalanced. Prior to each task participants were given 10 practice trials. Participants were instructed to respond as quickly and accurate as possible by pressing the five key on the numeric pad when the target was present and the four key when the target was absent. Thereafter, the eye link camera was attached to the head and calibrated. On each trial the sequence of events was as follows: a fixation cross was presented. The participant had to fixate at the cross and press the space bar subsequently. Fixation of the fixation cross was used for on-line drift correction of the eye tracker. Then, the search display appeared and remained visible until the participant responded. After the response the next trial started.


Results

One of the subjects in the PDD group showed a high number of errors and a deviant pattern in reaction time data, and was excluded from further analysis. The results described below are therefore based on six subjects with PDD, and seven controls.

Discussion

). We tested this hypothesis by measuring eye movements during search tasks in high functioning adult men with PDD and an age- and IQ-matched control group. In case of enhanced stimulus discriminability, shorter fixation times and/or fewer fixations were expected in the PDD group, as compared to the control group. The alternative explanation, that subjects with PDD use more efficient search strategies, was also tested. A more efficient search strategy would be reflected in a longer fixation time.

). This indicates that superior search performance in subjects with PDD is a robust finding that can be demonstrated in both children and adults.
2001
). The finding that the pattern of effects for fixation times was strongly similar to the RT effect provides additional evidence that superior performance in this task is indeed related to enhanced discriminatory abilities in PDD.

Concluding, the measurement of eye movements during search tasks shows that the superior behavior of subjects with PDD in these tasks cannot be attributed to strategy difference, but point indeed to increased stimulus discriminability in this group.
