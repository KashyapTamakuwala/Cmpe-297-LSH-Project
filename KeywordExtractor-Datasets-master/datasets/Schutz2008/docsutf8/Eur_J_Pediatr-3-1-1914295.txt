Most drugs that are currently prescribed in pediatrics have not been tested in children. Pediatric drug studies are stimulated in the USA by the pediatric exclusivity provision under the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act (FDAMA) that grants patent extensions when pediatric labeling is provided. We investigated the effectiveness of these programs in stimulating drug research in children, thereby increasing the evidence for safe and effective drug use in the pediatric population. All drugs granted pediatric exclusivity under the FDAMA were analyzed by studying the relevant summaries of medical and clinical pharmacology reviews of the pediatric studies or, if these were unavailable, the labeling information as provided by the manufacturer. A systematic search of the literature was performed to identify drug utilization patterns in children. From July 1998 to August 2006, 135 drug entities were granted pediatric exclusivity. Most frequent drug groups were anti-depressants and mood stabilizers, ACE inhibitors, lipid-lowering preparations, HIV antivirals, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory and anti-rheumatic drugs. The distribution of the different drugs closely matched the distribution of these drugs over the adult market, and not the drug utilization by children.
 Many drug studies in children have been performed since the introduction of the FDAMA. However, children infrequently use the drugs granted pediatric exclusivity. The priorities for pediatric drug research should be set by the need of the patients, not by market considerations.

], it is considered unacceptable to treat children with drugs that have not been studied properly.
In 1997, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Congress introduced the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act (FDAMA), and this was followed by the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act. Closely linked to this legislation is the Pediatric Rule (1998), which requires the industry to perform research in the pediatric population. In the European Union (EU), final legislation on this topic has been approved and will come into effect at the beginning of 2007.
In both continents, the measures taken to address the problems broadly follow the same pattern. The first incentive is aimed at new medicines and intended for products covered by a patent or a supplementary protection certificate (SPC). For these drugs, a 6-month extension of market exclusivity is granted if a pediatric study is performed. The second incentive has the objective of increasing the knowledge on drugs that are no longer patent protected. In order to obtain the data necessary to establish safety, quality and efficacy specifically in children, either funding for the studies (USA) or market exclusivity (a so-called Pediatric Use Marketing Authorization—PUMA) can be given. Central to the second incentive is that experts are involved in determining for which drugs the greatest medical need exists and in ensuring that these drugs will be given priority. In the USA, the FDA plays this central role, and in the EU, a Pediatric Committee will be established within the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) which will be given a similar role.

].
At the brink of implementing new programs (EU) or decisions on continuation of existing programs (USA), we questioned what the influence of the pediatric exclusivity regulation has been on pediatric drug development. We evaluated the drugs that are granted pediatric exclusivity in the USA by studying research that has been performed as a consequence of the exclusivity provision, and by comparing the drugs granted pediatric exclusivity with medicines actually used by children.

]. Data were extracted about the type of study, number and age of participants, whether long-term follow-up (defined as >1 year with specific attention for long term effects on growth and development) was undertaken and whether the study led to a pediatric indication being included on the label. Participants were divided into pediatric age categories according to the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) guidelines: neonates (birth–27 days), infants (28 days–23 months), children (2–11 years) and adolescents (12–18 years).

]. The data were categorized according to the ATC system as mentioned above.
Literature search and selection strategy
Child, preschool (or) child (or) infant (or) infant, newborn (or) adolescent (or) pediatric (or) paediatric (or) paediatrics.

Pharmaceutical preparations (or) drugs, non-prescription (or) drugs, generic (or) drug, therapy (or) prescriptions, drug (or) medicine (or) medication.

Drug utilization (or) pharmacoepidemiology (or) drug utilization review.



Step 2: the references contained in articles identified in step 1 were examined to identify further relevant studies.
Step 3: based on the titles and abstracts of the papers, we next identified and then located full-text copies of 35 potentially relevant studies for closer examination.
Study performed in the industrialized world, defined as in Europe, North America, Australia and New Zealand.

Study population of children from 0 to at least 14 years, to include all age groups (neonates, infants, children and adolescents).

Sufficient information in the paper about drug utilization to classify 90% of the drugs in an ATC drug groups.

Avoidance of selection bias by exclusion of voluntary surveys.



 Step 5: inclusion of nine papers meeting all selection criteria.

 = 57). No information could be found on 12 of the drug entities, mainly including over the counter drugs. The product label of 13 drugs merely stated that safety and/or efficacy in the pediatric population had not been established. For the remaining 105 drugs, in total, 326 studies were performed for the approval of pediatric exclusivity. At least 40,075 pediatric patients participated in these 326 studies (the number of participants was not noted for 27 of these studies). In the majority of the applications, children over a wide age range were included. Information on the age of participants was not provided for 54 of the 326 studies. Children participated in 224 of the remaining 272 studies (82%), adolescents in 177 (65%), infants were included in 105 (39%) of the trials, and neonates in 38 trials (14%). Only 1 (0.4%) study included preterm infants. The objective of most (62%) of the 326 studies was to determine the safety and efficacy of a drug. Pharmacokinetics and/or pharmacodynamics were studied in 147 (45%) trials, efficacy-only in 13 (4%) and safety-only in 38 (12%). From the 299 studies in which information about the number of participants was given, on average 134 children participated per study. This varied from 8 children in a safety and efficacy study of a HIV antiviral in neonates, to 994 children participating in a safety database of an antibiotic. Long-term (>1 year) follow-up was either done or planned for 25 (21%) of the 118 drugs.
For 42% of the drugs granted pediatric exclusivity and for which information was available (50 out of 118), the information obtained from the pediatric studies led to an approved pediatric indication.

]. Although the increased profit was intended by the legislator, we doubt if the other intention, which aimed at providing data to reduce the volume of drugs taken by children that are off-label or unlicensed, has also been met.

]. Secondly, the method employed in our literature search may have introduced some bias toward outpatient drug consumption, thus underestimating the use of, for example, anesthetic or cardiovascular drugs. Clearly, hypertension or lipid disorders occur in children, and knowledge about these drugs in this population is important. However, these conditions are certainly not major causes of morbidity, and subsequent drug use in children and the research priorities lie elsewehere.

].
Finally, methodological research has remained underfunded by this approach. Any expansion of research will require specialized techniques that allow samples and data to be obtained in children with minimal discomfort and risk. For instance, most pharmacokinetic assays require an amount of blood that is too large for the average neonate, so highly sensitive assays need to be developed. Accurate assessment of drug effects on neuro-development and behavior also require further development, independently of studies with particular compounds.

]. Although elements of this network are now beginning to form, their funding is unclear and certainly not at the level provided to the patent holders by a patent extension. Also, it is not immediately clear why the EU measures will deliver, when this was not achieved with the formation of Pediatric Pharmacology Research Units and the oversight of research priorities by the FDA in the USA.
In conclusion, the schemes implemented in the US generated new knowledge and led to the rapid development of an infrastructure to carry out pediatric drug trials. Although these are certainly positive developments, we do believe that the findings of this survey warrant additional efforts to stimulate research on drugs used more frequently by children, and generally applicable methodological research, as at least the short-term effect of these initiatives seems to have drawn the focus of industry-sponsored research to the most profitable part of the market. The funding of the research we propose should not be problematic. The pediatric exclusivity schemes generate a flow of public money to the sponsoring drug companies because generic replacement and price reductions are postponed. There is no particular reason why these public funds could not be at least partly applied in an alternative manner.
