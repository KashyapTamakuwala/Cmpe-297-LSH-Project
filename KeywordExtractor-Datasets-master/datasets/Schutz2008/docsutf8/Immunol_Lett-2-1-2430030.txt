 T cells in a contact-dependent manner, as shown by proliferation and cytokine production. Activation of lymphocytes was not due to contaminating macrophages. These studies demonstrate that murine neutrophils present MHC Class II-restricted peptides and induce T cell proliferation, confirming findings in human neutrophils, and demonstrate a novel pro inflammatory effect of murine neutrophils.

Human studies of antigen-specific neutrophil-T cell interactions are confounded by low frequency of antigen-specific T cells in peripheral blood, variation of MHC allele expression, which therefore impedes ideal peptide antigen identification. To overcome these complications, we have employed a murine model system. Moreover, despite the important role of the neutrophil in the pathogenesis of numerous inflammatory diseases, many of which are modelled in rodents, there is a relative paucity of information on murine Class II restricted antigen presentation. We, therefore, sought to investigate whether murine neutrophils present antigens via MHC Class II.

As there were <5% F4/80 positive macrophages contaminating the neutrophil samples, these titration experiments indicated that only a small proportion of the T cell hybridoma activation observed in the ‘neutrophil presentation’ assays could be attributable to macrophage contamination.

A titration of macrophages was performed to give an estimate of the contribution of contaminating cells, demonstrating that only a small proportion of neutrophil-induced T cell responses could be attributable to contaminating macrophages.

Discussion
Data presented here demonstrate that murine neutrophils are indeed capable of directly presenting antigen on Class II MHC and activating T cells independently of other APCs. The DO11.10-GFP hybridoma cells respond exclusively in a Class II restricted manner, and our data demonstrate that neutrophils, rather than contaminating cells, were mediating this response.
At comparable cell ratios, neutrophil-mediated T cell activation was lower than that mediated by macrophages, commensurate with reduced expression of MHC Class II by neutrophils. Although neutrophils have been reported to express co-stimulatory molecules, we detected only low levels of CD40 and were unable to consistently detect CD80 or CD86 in our neutrophil preparations (in contrast to the F4/80 positive macrophages which expressed CD40, CD80 and CD86; data not shown). Thus it is possible that: co-stimulatory molecule expression below the limits of detection of methods used here is sufficient for inducing a response, that T cells are responding in a co-stimulation independent manner, or that co-stimulation has occurred via alternative molecules.

).
There are overall fewer studies of murine neutrophils compared to human neutrophils, which is likely to be a reflection of the ease of acquiring human neutrophils that constitute 70% of circulating leucocytes, compared to limited quantity of murine peripheral blood available and the relative paucity of neutrophils, contributing only 20% of circulating leukocytes in rodents. These studies were only possible through use of rodent cells, as the TCR transgenic T cells absolutely control antigen specificity of response, which was central to this investigation of neutrophil-T cell interactions. However, the significantly different proportion of neutrophils in murine and human peripheral blood raises questions as to whether murine and human neutrophils perform parallel functions as is assumed. Our data document a novel, Class II restricted antigen presenting function of murine neutrophils, confirming findings in other human systems, and expanding our understanding of the role of the neutrophil in the adaptive immune response.
