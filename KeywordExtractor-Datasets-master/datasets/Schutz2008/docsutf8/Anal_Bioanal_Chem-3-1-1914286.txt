Optimisation of peak capacity is an important strategy in gradient liquid chromatography (LC). This can be achieved by using either long columns or columns packed with small particles. Monolithic columns allow the use of long columns at relatively low back-pressure. The gain in peak capacity using long columns was evaluated by the separation of a tryptic bovine serum albumin digest with an LC–UV–mass spectrometry (MS) system and monolithic columns of different length (150 and 750 mm). Peak capacities were determined from UV chromatograms and MS/MS data were used for Mascot database searching. Analyses with a similar gradient slope for the two columns produced ratios of the peak capacities that were close to the expected value of the square root of the column length ratio. Peak capacities of the short column were 12.6 and 25.0 with 3 and 15 min gradients, respectively, and 29.7 and 41.0 for the long column with 15 and 75 min gradients, respectively. Protein identification scores were also higher for the long column, 641 and 750 for the 3- and 15-min gradients with the short column and 1,376 and 993 for the 15- and 75-min gradients with the long column. Thus, the use of long monolithic columns provides improved peptide separation and increased reliability of protein identification.

] scores. Such an approach is also useful, as the mass spectrometer adds a second dimension to the separation, which is overlooked when only chromatographic efficiency is measured.
In this paper the evaluation of capillary monolithic silica columns of different lengths for the LC-UV-MS analysis of a bovine serum albumin (BSA) tryptic digest is described. Columns of 150- and 750-mm length were investigated using gradient times varying from 3 to 75 min. Chromatographic peak capacities, based on UV detection, and protein identification, based on Mascot scoring data of the MS detection, were determined as a measure for the efficiency of peptide separation.

Acetonitrile was high-performance LC gradient grade (Biosolve, Valkenswaard, the Netherlands), and spectroscopy-grade trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) was obtained from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany).

 buffer (pH 8). After addition of 25 μl of 10 mM DTT solution, the sample was incubated at 50 °C for 30 min to reduce disulfide bonds. After cooling to room temperature, 25 μl of 30 mM IAA solution was added and the sample was incubated in the dark for 60 min to alkylate the free thiols. Trypsin was dissolved in 10 μl of buffer to reach a trypsin-to-protein mass ratio of 1:50 in the final solution; the trypsin solution was added to the sample, which was incubated at 37 °C overnight for 15 h. The digestion was stopped by addition of 15 μl of 10% TFA. The sample was diluted to 200 ng/μl (3 μM) with LC mobile phase A (water plus 0.05% TFA) and injected without further purification.

Apparatus and LC columns
All analyses were performed with an Agilent 1100 nanoLC system (Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany), consisting of a vacuum degasser, a binary Nano-Pump, a μ-well plate sampler and a column switching module with a trapping column in the 1–4 position of the six-port column-switching valve. The trapping pump was a Gynkotek model 480 (Gynkotek, Germering, Germany). Detection was performed by UV and MS detection, with the detectors connected in series. The UV detector was an MU 701 UV–VIS detector (ATAS GL International, Veldhoven, the Netherlands), equipped with an external optical-fibre flow cell (6 nl, 3-mm light path); peptides were detected at 215 nm. The mass spectrometer was an Agilent LC/MSD Trap XCT (Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany) ion-trap mass spectrometer, equipped with an orthogonal electrospray ionisation (ESI) interface. The external flow cell of the UV detector allows minimal time delay and band-broadening between UV and MS detection.
The monolithic columns were provided by GL Sciences (Tokyo, Japan). The columns were a 150 mm × 0.1 mm MonoCap for nano-flow C18-silica monolithic column and a 750 mm × 0.2 mm MonoCap high resolution C18-silica monolithic column. For trapping of the digest a 5 mm × 0.3 mm column packed with 5 μm Zorbax 300 SB-C18 (Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany) was used.

]. LC-MS/MS data were converted to the Mascot generic format (.mgf file) using the data-analysis software, and the .mgf files were searched against the MSDB database using Mascot’s MS/MS ion search module. The database was searched for tryptic peptides from all entries in the database, allowing one missed cleavage per peptide and containing carbamidomethyl cysteine as a variable modification. Mass tolerances were set to default values: peptide mass tolerance ±2.0 Da, MS/MS tolerance ±0.8 Da.


Results and discussion
Liquid chromatography–UV analysis
Because of the difference in diameter, the 150 mm × 0.1 mm and the 750 mm × 0.2 mm columns were used with different flow rates. For the 150- and the 750-mm columns, the flow rates were 0.5 and 2.0 μl/min, respectively, resulting in a linear flow rate of 1.06 mm/s. Injection volumes were also proportional to the square of the column diameter, 0.25 μl of the digest for the 0.1-mm column and 1.0 μl onto the 0.2-mm column. During the gradient, the maximum back-pressure of the 750-mm column was below 20 Mpa, which is well below the manufacturers limit of 30 Mpa.

Conclusions
The use of long silica-based capillary monolithic columns provides a clear advantage over use of shorter columns, i.e. an increase of chromatographic efficiency and reliability of protein identification. As expected from chromatography theory, a factor 5 longer column gives a 1.6–2.4 times increase in peak capacity for separations with similar gradient slope. The use of longer gradients also leads to an initial improvement of the protein identification score, but the score seems to have a maximum at longer gradient times.
While the use of longer columns for the separation of peptides has a clear advantage because of the gain in chromatographic efficiency, this also gives a longer analysis time. As maximum protein identification scores for rather simple digests are reached at relatively short gradient times, it is important to find a compromise between chromatographic efficiency and analysis time. However, if the sample is more complex, the use of longer columns is more attractive as longer gradients are necessary to achieve sufficient separation.
In the near future, short and long columns of the same diameter (0.1-mm inner diameter) will be compared. Further improvement of the separation might be obtained by optimisation of the combination of the trap column and the analysis column. Moreover, the potential of longer monolithic capillary columns will be demonstrated by the analysis of more complex and real samples.
