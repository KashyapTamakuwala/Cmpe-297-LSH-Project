Background
In fair-skinned Caucasian populations both the incidence and mortality rates of cutaneous melanoma have been increasing over the past decades. With adjuvant therapies still being under investigation, early detection is the only way to improve melanoma patient survival. The influence of incisional biopsies on melanoma patient survival has been discussed for many years. This study investigates both the influence of diagnostic biopsy type and the presence of residual tumor cells in the re-excision specimen on disease free and overall survival.

Methods
After (partial) removal of a pigmented skin lesion 471 patients were diagnosed with stage I/II melanoma and underwent re-excision and a sentinel node biopsy. All patients were followed prospectively, mean follow up >5 years. Patients were divided according to their diagnostic biopsy type (wide excision biopsy, narrow excision biopsy, excision biopsy with positive margins and incisional biopsy) and the presence of residual tumor cells in their re-excision specimen. Survival analysis was done using Cox’s proportional hazard model adjusted for eight important confounders of melanoma patient survival.

Results
The diagnostic biopsy was wide in 279 patients, narrow in 109 patients, 52 patients underwent an excision biopsy with positive margins and 31 patients an incisional biopsy. In 41 patients residual tumor cells were present in the re-excision specimen. Both the diagnostic biopsy type and the presence of tumor cells in the re-excision specimen did not influence disease free and overall survival of melanoma patients.

Conclusions
Non-radical diagnostic biopsies do not negatively influence melanoma patient survival.

This study investigated both the influence of diagnostic biopsy type and the presence of residual tumor cells in the re-excision specimen on melanoma patient disease free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS), in 471 patients with a mean FU of more than 5 years. Survival analysis was done using Cox’s proportional hazard model adjusted for; gender, age, site of primary melanoma, Breslow thickness, type of melanoma, ulceration, lymphatic invasion and sentinel node (SN) status. Both the diagnostic biopsy type and the presence of tumor cells in the re-excision specimen were found not to influence melanoma patient survival.
METHODS
Patients

20
 In short, the day before surgery patients underwent a dynamic and static lymphoscintigraphy to determine the lymphatic drainage pattern. Just prior to surgery, Patent Blue V (Laboratoire Guerbet, Aulnay-sous-Bois, France) was injected intradermally next to the initial site of the melanoma. During surgery, guided by a hand held gamma probe and the blue staining of the draining tissues, the SN was removed.
To investigate the influence on survival, patients were divided both according to their diagnostic biopsy type; wide excisional biopsy (lateral clearance ≥ 2 mm), narrow excisional biopsy (lateral clearance < 2 mm), excisional biopsy with positive margins and incisional biopsy (includes punch) and the presence of residual tumor cells in their re-excision specimen.

Statistical Analysis
P
 values <0.05 were considered significant.


RESULTS
Patient Population
Between August 1993 and September 2004, 551 patients were diagnosed with clinical stage I/II cutaneous melanoma, 257 male (46.6%) and 294 female (53.4%) with a mean age of 49.9 years (Table 1). Most primary melanomas were located on the trunk (43.7%) or on the lower extremities (36.7%). Breslow thickness was categorized into four groups ( ≤ 1.00 mm; 1.01–2.00 mm; 2.01–4.00 mm; >4.01 mm), but due to spontaneous regression of the primary lesion remained unknown in 38 patients. The majority of patients had a superficial spreading melanoma (65.0%) or a nodular melanoma (26.7%). In 46 patients the type of melanoma was different or remained unknown (8.3%). Ulceration, defined as the absence of intact epidermis overlying the major portion of primary melanoma, was diagnosed in 80 patients (14.5%), unknown in 1 patient (0.2%) and absent in 470 patients (85.3%). Lymphatic invasion was present in 25 patients (4.5%), absent in 521 patients (94.6%) and remained unknown in 5 patients (0.9%). The SN was negative in 446 patients (80.9%) and positive in 94 patients (17.1%). In 11 patients the SN was not removed and the SN status remained unknown (2.0%). In total, there were 101 missing variables in 80 patients; all were excluded from the study.

SN Identification
In 11 of the 551 patients the SN status remained unknown (2.0%), in 5 of these patients the SN was located in the deep lobe of the parotid gland and in one patient the SN was located high in the left axilla, in all cases the decision was made not to remove the SN to avoid potential morbidity associated with the intervention. The SN was not identified in 3 cases due to non-visualization by preoperative lymphoscintigraphy. In one patient the SN was located in the right axilla and could not be removed because the patient was suffering from frozen shoulder syndrome, the physical condition of another patient did not allow further treatment. Therefore, the success rate of SN identification was 98% (540 of 551 patients). Two of the patients with the SN located in the deep lobe of the parotid gland experienced metastasis of the parotid gland, one patient is still alive with disease and one patient is dead of disease. The patient whose physical condition did not allow further treatment, passed away soon after re-excision of the primary melanoma site, from massive hematogenic and lymphogenic metastasis. The 8 remaining patients have shown no evidence of disease.

In 91/471 patients (19.3%) the SN was positive, 58/279 patients (20.8%) after a wide excision biopsy, 14/109 patients (12.8%) after a narrow excision biopsy, 15/52 patients (28.8%) after an excision biopsy with positive margins and 4/31 patients (12.9%) after an incisional biopsy.
In 79/471 patients (16.8%) a recurrence was found during FU, 45/279 patients (16.1%) after a wide excision biopsy (21 locoregional skin, 8 SN basin and 16 systemic), 17/109 patients (15.5%) after a narrow excision biopsy (7 locoregional skin, 2 SN basin and 8 systemic), 10/52 patients (19.2%) after an excision biopsy with positive margins (5 locoregional skin, 2 SN basin and 3 systemic) and 7/31 patients (22.6%) after an incision biopsy (5 locoregional skin, and 2 systemic). But confounding factors were not equally distributed between the diagnostic biopsy groups. Therefore, survival analysis was done using Cox’s proportional hazard model adjusted for; gender, age, site of primary melanoma, Breslow thickness, type of melanoma, ulceration, lymphatic invasion and sentinel node (SN) status.

The same analysis was done after combining the groups; the wide excision biopsy group was joined with the narrow excision biopsy group and compared to the excision biopsy group with positive margins joined with the incision biopsy group. Still, diagnostic biopsy type did not have a significant influence on either DFS or OS (data not shown).

 Of course these problems are less prominent in excision biopsies with positive margins, here the majority of the lesion has been removed and only the outer borders are compromised making a sampling error highly unlikely.

 it is important for all physicians to feel confident about removing a pigmented skin lesion suspect for melanoma. Incisional biopsies are not recommended but there is no cause for concern when an excision biopsy turns out to have positive margins.
