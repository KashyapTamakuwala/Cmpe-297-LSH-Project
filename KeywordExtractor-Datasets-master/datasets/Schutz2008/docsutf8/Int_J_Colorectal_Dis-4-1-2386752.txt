Introduction
Transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM) is a minimal invasive technique for local excision of rectal tumours. The procedure is performed via a rectoscope with a diametre of 4 cm. The aim of this prospective study was to assess both functional outcome and quality of life after TEM.

Patients and methods
Between 2004 and 2006, 47 patients were studied prior to and at least 6 months after TEM. Demographics, operative details and post-operative complications were recorded. Functional outcome was determined using the Faecal Incontinence Severity Index (FISI). Quality of life was measured using the EuroQol EQ-5D questionnaire and the Faecal Incontinence Quality of Life (FIQL) score.

Conclusion
This study indicates TEM has no deteriorating effect on faecal continence. Moreover, once the tumour has been excised using TEM, quality of life is improved.

Quality of life is increasingly recognised as the ultimate endpoint when assessing clinical outcomes after different surgical interventions because it measures the patient’s perspective. The precise impact of the TEM procedure on quality of life has not been well studied. This prospective study was set out to provide a comprehensive insight into the impact of TEM on functional outcome and quality of life.

]. This system, developed by Rockwood, uses two basic components: the type of incontinence and its frequency. FISI scores range from 0 (total continence) to 61 (complete incontinence to solid stool on a daily basis). We used the validated weighting scores that are based on patients’ input.

EQ-VAS represents the patients’ perspective on quality of life; index score represents the societal value on quality of life. Higher scores indicate higher quality of life. Both scores are compared with a healthy sex- and age-matched control group.

]. However, because of the low number of invasive carcinomas in our series this is purely theoretical. The societal value of general quality of life, EQ-5D, remained unchanged. Measuring quality of life using the FIQL questionnaires resulted in a significant improvement in two of the four FIQL domains (embarrassment and lifestyle). Moreover, the domains of lifestyle, coping and behaviour and embarrassment were all significantly correlated with the FISI.
In conclusion, how are these results to be interpreted? This study supports the hypothesis that rectal tumours give rise to incontinence-like symptoms, especially in low-lying rectal tumours. After the tumour is excised using the TEM technique, faecal continence improves. TEM itself does not improve continence but also does not deteriorate faecal continence. Mean quality of life from the patients’ perspective following TEM is improved.
Based on, as we know, the only two studies addressing anorectal functioning and quality of life after TEM in one study, it can be concluded that TEM does not impair faecal continence. Also, quality of life is not negatively influenced by the TEM procedure itself, and therefore TEM is the procedure of choice in all rectal adenomas.
