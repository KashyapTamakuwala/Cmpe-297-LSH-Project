Objective
To determine the association of atrophy of the abductor digiti minimi muscle (ADMA), an MRI manifestation of chronic compression of the inferior calcaneal nerve suggesting the clinical diagnosis of Baxter’s neuropathy, with MRI markers of potential etiologies, including calcaneal spur formation, plantar fasciitis, calcaneal edema, Achilles tendinosis and posterior tibial tendon dysfunction (PTTD).

Materials and methods
Prevalence of calcaneal spur formation, plantar fasciitis, calcaneal edema, Achilles tendinosis and PTTD was assessed retrospectively on 100 MRI studies with ADMA and 100 MRI studies without ADMA. Patients ranged in age from 10–92 years. Pearson chi-square analyses and Fisher’s exact test were used to compare prevalence of the above findings in patients with and without ADMA. Logistic regression was used to determine which variables were significantly associated with ADMA.

Conclusion
Advancing age, calcaneal spur, and plantar fasciitis are significantly associated with ADMA. Their high odds ratios support the notion of a possible etiologic role for calcaneal spur and plantar fasciitis in the progression to Baxter’s neuropathy.

]. Our study was performed to assess the frequency of MRI manifestations of these potential etiologic factors in patients with and without ADMA to test the hypothesis that MRI findings reflecting altered biomechanics or direct compression of the inferior calcaneal nerve occur more frequently in patients with ADMA.

Materials and methods
Patient population
This retrospective study included 200 individuals who were referred for MRI of the hindfoot due to the presence of foot pain. These were individuals seen in a subspecialty teleradiology group practice with participant referrals from 40 states. The study was conducted with data from August 2006 to January 2007 and included patients of all ages. The study group was composed of 100 consecutive individuals with abductor digiti minimi atrophy and 100 consecutive individuals without abductor digiti minimi atrophy. No eligible participants were excluded. The subspecialty teleradiology group practice does not have an Institutional Review Board (IRB), and the study was conducted in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki principles and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. Owing to the retrospective nature of the study, informed consent was not obtained.
Participants’ ages ranged from 10–92 years [mean = 49.0 years, standard deviation (SD) = 16.9 years] and included 139 women and 61 men.

MRI technique
Patients were scanned in magnets ranging from 0.2 T to 1.5 T. Long- and short-axis fat and fluid sensitive sequences were obtained without the administration of gadolinium. The technical parameters for all magnet strengths were as follows: sagittal T1-weighted, sagittal short-tau inversion recovery (STIR), oblique axial STIR, coronal T1-weighted, coronal STIR, plantar flexed axial proton density, axial T2-weighted, and axial T2-weighted with fat saturation or STIR.

Statistical analysis
Age and gender distribution, as well as the frequency of plantar fasciitis, calcaneal spur formation, calcaneal edema, PTTD, and Achilles tendon dysfunction, were compared in patients with and without ADMA. Age was compared with analysis of variance (ANOVA). For the categorical variables we used, as appropriate, Pearson chi-square analyses or Fisher’s exact test to compare the proportion of those with atrophy to those without. We used logistic regression to determine odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for each of the variables to atrophy. First, we included each variable in a univariate model to determine its relationship to atrophy. We then simultaneously included all the variables in a multivariate analysis to determine the relationship of the variable to atrophy, while simultaneously adjusting for all the other variables. Alpha level was at 0.05, and all tests were two-sided. SPSS version 15.0 (2006) (SPSS, Chicago, USA) was used for the analyses.


Results

Of the 200 patients in the study, the consensus reviewers (U.C. and A.L) disagreed with findings in the initial report of eight , three with ADMA and five without ADMA. In two of the cases of ADMA, the presence of a calcaneal spur was not mentioned in the initial report. In the third case of ADMA, the presence of posterior tibial tendinosis was not mentioned in the initial report. For three of the five patients without ADMA, the presence of a calcaneal spur was not mentioned in the initial report. For one of the patients without ADMA, the presence of Achilles tendinosis was not mentioned in the initial report. For one patient without ADMA, the presence of plantar fasciitis was not mentioned.

Discussion
Patients with ADMA had a significantly greater frequency of Achilles tendinosis, calcaneal edema, calcaneal spur, plantar fasciitis, and posterior tibialis tendon dysfunction than those without ADMA. After logistic regression analysis, only increased age, calcaneal spur, and plantar fasciitis remained significantly associated with ADMA.

]. The prevalence of ADMA in that study is corroborated by the findings in our study, in which it was necessary for us to review 1,780 MRI studies in order to identify 100 patients with ADMA, corresponding to a prevalence of 5.6%. The study also found that the most common associated findings in patients with ADMA were plantar enthesophytes and plantar fasciitis, but it did not include a statistical analysis of the prevalence of associated findings in patients with and without ADMA. Our study includes the largest number of patients with ADMA on MRI and is the first study to perform logistic regression analysis to determine independent variables associated with ADMA.
Limitations of the study include retrospective data collection, which may lead to selection bias; however, we attempted to minimize selection bias by including 100 consecutive patients in each study group. In addition, the inclusion of 15 pediatric patients might have affected the results, as younger patients are less likely to have degenerative conditions of the foot or ankle and could potentially have falsely decreased the frequency of findings in the group of patients without abductor digiti minimi atrophy. However, a repeat statistical analysis, from which the pediatric patients had been excluded, demonstrated no significant difference in results.
In summary, our study showed a significant association between atrophy of the abductor digit minimi muscle, an MRI manifestation of Baxter’s neuropathy, with age, plantar calcaneal spur formation, and plantar fasciitis. These findings support the notion of an etiologic role for compression of the inferior calcaneal nerve as it passes anterior to the medial calcaneal tuberosity in the development of Baxter’s neuropathy.
