Biologics targeting TNF have brought about a paradigm shift in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and infliximab, anti-TNF-α chimeric monoclonal antibody, was marketed in 2003 in Japan. We previously reported on the RECONFIRM study, a retrospective clinical study on the efficacy of infliximab therapy in a RA management group in Japan, where we evaluated the clinical response after 22 weeks of the therapy in 258 patients. The study reported here was aimed at reconfirming the clinical efficacy of the infliximab therapy and demographic factors related to the efficacy over a 54-week study period in 410 RA patients in the same study group. Infliximab was infused according to the domestically approved method, and the clinical response was evaluated following 54 weeks of infliximab therapy using the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) response criteria. Disease activity was assessed by DAS28-CRP (Disease Activity Score including a 28-joint count/C-reactive protein). Infliximab was discontinued in 24.4% of the 410 patients at 54 weeks and 9.3% and 8.1% discontinued the therapy due to adverse events and inefficiency, respectively. Average DAS28-CRP decreased from 5.5 at week 0 to 3.1 at week 54 after the therapy. Patients in remission and those showing low-, moderate-, and high-disease activity changed from 0.0, 1.0, 9.0 and 90.0%, respectively, at the start of the study to 27.6, 11.7, 34.4 and 26.3%, respectively, at week 54. Younger age, RF-negativity and low scores of DAS28-CRP showed significant correlations with remission at week 54. EULAR response criteria—good, moderate, and no response to infliximab—were 37.0, 41.7 and 21.2%, respectively. In conclusion, we reconfirmed the clinical efficacy of infliximab and demographic factors related to the efficacy over a 54-week study period in 410 Japanese patients with RA using DAS28-CRP and EULAR response criteria.

]. However, the RECONFIRM study evaluated the clinical response following only 22 weeks of infliximab therapy in 258 patients.
In this RECONFIRM-2 study, we assessed the clinical efficacy and safety of infliximab and MTX over a 54-week study period when used in 410 RA patients in the same group, in order to reconfirm not only its clinical efficacy but also demographic factors related to the efficacy.

Patients and methods
Data and information on RA patients that fulfilled the diagnostic criteria of the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) were collected from three major rheumatology centers in Japan, including the First Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, University of Occupational and Environmental Health Japan, Kitakyushu; the Division of Rheumatology and Clinical Immunology, Department of Internal Medicine, Saitama Medical Center, Saitama Medical University, Saitama; and the Institute of Rheumatology, Tokyo Women’s Medical University. All patients that received infliximab treatment in each institution by December 2005 were registered with this retrospective study. Demographic data, including disease duration and concomitant therapy, were collected from medical charts. The following parameters were evaluated before and at 54 weeks after the initial infliximab infusion: tender joint count (TJC) 28, swollen joint count (SJC) 28, patient’s assessment of pain on a visual analog scale (patient’s pain VAS), patient’s global assessment of disease activity (patient’s global VAS), physician’s global assessment of disease activity (physician’s global VAS), and C-reactive protein (CRP).
Infliximab therapy

]. Concomitant use of MTX was instituted in all cases, although the dose of MTX was determined by each attending physician.

]. Secondary insufficiency to infliximab was defined as patients with good or moderate EULAR response at week 22, and whose DAS28 increased to >0.6 or >1.2 from week 22 to 54.

Discontinued subjects
The continuation rate of infliximab therapy was calculated by all causes of discontinuation. Cumulative hazards and associated factors were analyzed in relation to three types of discontinuation: adverse events, inefficacy, and remission.

Age, sex, and disease duration were similar among these three institutes, while the %user and dose of MTX or PSL were divergent and the disease activities as assessed by TJC, SJC, GH, and DAS28 was also different.

Discussion

]. The assessment of efficacy, however, was based only on the physician’s general evaluation and not on quantitative measures such as EULAR criteria. In this report, therefore, efficacy data based on DAS28-CRP and EULAR improvement criteria were intensively assessed. The average DAS28-CRP before starting infliximab was 5.5, it decreased to 3.2 at week 22 and it remained steady at 3.1 by week 54 after the infliximab therapy. At week 22 after the therapy, about 28% and 40% of patients satisfied the remission and low disease activity criteria, respectively, and these effects remained (28 and 39%, respectively) by week 54. Also, about 37% of the patients exhibited good response according to EULAR criteria continuously from week 22 to  54. These results reconfirmed that the clinical efficacy of infliximab at week 22 was maintained until week 54 in most of the patients treated with infliximab. Thus, appropriate treatment with infliximab and MTX in this study group could minimize secondary insufficiency of the therapy for at least one year.

 pneumonia (3), but more than two-thirds of the withdrawals due to adverse events were observed within the first 14 weeks after the therapy.
In this study, to clarify how predisposing factors from the demographic characteristics of RA patients were related to the clinical efficacy of infliximab therapy, a multivariate analysis using a logistic regression was performed. In this study, multiple variables including sex, age, duration of disease, stage, class, positive/negative RF, concomitant MTX dose, concomitant PSL dose, and initial levels of CRP, TJC, SJC and GH were assessed. It is worth noting that, among multiple variables, younger age, RF-negativity and lower levels of DAS28-CRP at the baseline were significantly correlated with the clinical remission induced by infliximab therapy at week 54. These results imply that the timely use of MTX and infliximab can be strongly recommended for younger RA patients that show RF-negativity in order to efficiently achieve clinical remission. On the other hand, male gender, older age and RF-negativity were significantly correlated with discontinuation of infliximab due to adverse reactions, whereas there was no significant factor responsible for discontinuation as a result of inefficacy, and only older age affected secondary insufficiency from week 22 to 54 after the infliximab therapy. Although it is intriguing that male gender predisposes for discontinuation as a result of adverse events, these results provide the first information that can be used to facilitate the more efficacious use of infliximab and MTX in the daily practice of rheumatologists.
Taken together, this REOCNFIRM-2 study reconfirms the clinical efficacy of treatment with infliximab and MTX in Japanese RA patients using the DAS28-CRP and EULAR response criteria. Among 410 patients with active RA, approximately 28% and 39% of the patients satisfied the remission and low disease activity criteria, and good response according to the EULAR criteria was achieved in 37% of the patients treated with infliximab plus MTX during the 54-week study period. The clinical efficacy of infliximab was maintained from week 22 to 54 after the treatment, and secondary insufficiency after week 22 was marginal after the appropriate treatment in this study group. Several demographic factors, including male gender, RF-negativity and lower scores of DAS28-CRP, were significant predisposing factors for remission. The promising effectiveness of infliximab at improving measures of disease activity in RA patients has led to this therapy becoming one of the key advances in the management of RA. Thus, this study is important because it provides obvious and invaluable evidence concerning the efficacy of the combinational use of infliximab and MTX, and can guide the real clinical use of infliximab in the future.
