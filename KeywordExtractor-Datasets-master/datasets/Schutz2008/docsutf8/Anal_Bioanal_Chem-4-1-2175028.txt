However, these studies are extremely time consuming, typically averaging more than 10 hours per sample because they require careful microdrilling techniques, low-blank liquid chromatographic separation techniques and TIMS analyses. The MC-ICPMS coupled with a laser ablation system should be able to perform a Sr isotope analyses within minutes, while importantly maintaining the spatial resolution and avoiding the extensive wet chemistry and warm up times on the TIMS instrument.

]. There is clearly a huge potential and a demand for the application of in situ Sr isotope analysis. Therefore the goals of this paper are to: (1) describe the different approaches that have been followed to date, (2) summarize the problems encountered, (3) discuss the solutions attempted to solve the encountered problems and (4) discuss studies which are needed in the near future to improve the LA-MC-ICPMS technique so that “routine” Sr isotope analysis becomes possible.

Although these minerals have low Rb/Sr ratios, the Ca/Sr ratios are high, which could result in potential interferences from Ca (see below).

Factors influencing the data quality of Sr isotope analysis by LA-MC-ICPMS
The following factors influence the quality of data which can be obtained by LA-MC-ICPMS: (1) counting statistics, (2) blank levels, (3) instrumental mass discrimination and laser-induced elemental and isotopic fractionation and (4) molecular interferences.

Similarly, most authors make the Kr corrections on the Sr masses by assuming that the laser-induced isotope fractionation and instrument discrimination are the same for Sr and Kr. For a good Kr correction, the mass bias has to be established in an independent way. We will use the term mass bias to describe both the laser-induced isotope fractionation and the instrument mass discrimination.

In the next section we discuss the main interferences and how they can compromise Sr isotope data, leading to errors in excess of those that can be tolerated for everyday applications.

The advantage of this method is that there is no mass bias correction involved. The gas blank also corrects for minor amounts of Sr and Rb on masses 84, 85, 86, 87 and 88 which are thought to be derived from the sample introduction system (see above).

Measurement of Sr isotopes by LA-MC-ICPMS, on the other hand, has great potential if the precision and accuracy required is in the order of 50 ppm, with the additional advantage of reduced analysis time (average of <5 min, including wash out and standard analysis, compared with >100 min for the TIMS analysis).

Sr isotopes by laser ablation analysis of other geological materials also looks promising (e.g. groundmass), whereas apatite and sphene require such large corrections that accurate results will be difficult to obtain.

]. Since corrections for isobaric interferences on Sr isotope masses are so large (compared with TIMS) the assumption that Rb instrumental discrimination and laser-induced elemental fractionation are the same as for Sr is probably not true. Lasers with low wavelength (e.g. 193 nm) will reduce this elemental and isotopic fractionation. However, the mass-bias contributions by instrumental mass discrimination and laser-induced elemental fractionation need to be determined independently.

].

The interferences of the REE are probably only important for materials that contain significant amounts of REE. Experimenting with optimal plasma conditions, which reduce the creation of doubly charged REE, is important.

The situation with Ca argides and dimer is unclear. More experimental work is needed, especially by ablating Ca-rich materials, which do not contain Sr.





Conclusions
87
Sr is performed. Higher Rb/Sr materials have been ablated using a standard-sample bracketing technique for correct Rb corrections with, to date, limited success.

Sr ratios are obtained.
Doubly charged REE interferences are only a problem in materials where significant REE contents are present, such as clinopyroxene. However, successful correction is possible by collecting data at half masses.
