) makes it possible to check, for example, how often a particular contact occurs when assigning NOESY spectra, or to find out whether a particular sequence fragment is likely to be difficult to assign. In this respect it formalises information that scientists with experience in spectrum analysis are aware of but cannot necessarily quantify. The analysis described here illustrates the importance of depositing constraints (and all other possible NMR derived information) along with the structure coordinates, as this type of information can greatly assist the NMR community.

), are applied on a per-entry basis, where the original or recalculated coordinates are related to the original or standardised constraint lists. With the amount of constraint data that is now available it has become possible to do a global, large-scale analysis using only the information from the constraints, without taking the coordinate information into account. The constraint lists are the ‘final product’ of the usually human analysis of NMR spectra, and as such they represent the experimental NMR-derived information that is relevant for the structure calculation. The constraint lists also provide a single set of data, whereas NMR structures are usually represented as ensembles that can be calculated in many different ways, which complicates their interpretation. Analysing the constraint data on a large scale can thus provide insights into the NMR data analysis process (e.g. which type of inter-atomic contact is often derived from the spectra), and the relation of the constraints to the coordinate data (e.g. does the structure calculation process add any distance information that is relevant for NMR).
The analysis described here relates only to distance constraints derived from NOE data, with a base set of 1834 NMR PDB entries containing 1909 protein chains. Only constraints between protons in protein chains were retained for analysis, and for validation purposes the base set was further divided into subsets for entries that contain intra-residue constraints and entries where all the original constraint and coordinate information was recognised and linked to each other. A coordinate data set based on the original coordinate files was also generated and used for comparison. This article explores some of the issues surrounding distance constraints and the NMR data they are derived from, and hopes to highlight the importance of depositing the constraint lists used for structure calculations along with the molecular coordinates.

), in a process that extends the procedure used in the original DOCR/FRED project. To handle the larger number of entries an automatic mapping procedure was developed that maps the molecule sequence as derived from the PDB file to the atom information and sequence code numbering used within the constraint lists. For some entries manual mapping between the information from the PDB file and the constraint file was required. The original 409 mappings from the RECOORD project (by Aart Nederveen) and a further mappings 124 by the author and 17 by Jurgen Doreleijers were used to correctly set the PDB-constraint file mapping for the entries in the base set. Using the automatic or manual mapping the atom information from the constraints was then connected to that for the molecule. During this process the dependence on string-based atom names for the assignment (as used in all constraint files) was also removed, since the CCPN data model is object-based. The final CCPN project, in which all the information from the original files is now highly organised, was then written out. This process was completed for 2643 PDB entries.

). After reading in the CCPN projects, non-relevant information was removed based on the filtering information, and the data reorganised into a set of Python dictionaries that contain the overall information on the entry, residue and constraint levels. In the final analysis step these dictionaries were read in, areas and data of interest were marked, and organised HTML output was produced for browsing. A Python dictionary with highly reduced information that can be further used for validation or constraint filtering purposes was also generated.

In the analysis, a residue is marked as ‘assigned’ when at least one proton belonging to it is linked to a constraint. The total number of times a particular inter-atomic contact is observed can be a fraction, as for ambiguous constraints each constraint item contributes a fraction of 1 to the total:

The information on an atom level is listed in the ‘Breakdown per contact’ table. Outliers per secondary structure combination based on a binomial analysis are highlighted in red (higher than expected) and blue (lower than expected).

The numbers that are relevant in order to determine whether a contact is significant for a particular secondary structure element are the occurrence within that particular secondary structure element (which has to be significantly higher than expected from the overall occurrence), the ambiguity of the contact (if it is high it comes, by definition, from highly ambiguous constraints and is therefore unreliable), and the uniqueness of the contact (which indicates how often the contact is seen within that secondary structure element compared to the total number of times it is observed).

), and is also highly unique (0.65). This situation is, as expected, reversed for the Hα–H contact, which is observed significantly less in α-helices and more in β-sheets. Overall, however, this contact is more uniquely observed in α-helices (0.49 compared to 0.08 for β-sheets), which is due to the prevalence of Ala–Ala fragments in α-helices (56.2% compared to 5.35%). Interestingly, however, an H–Hβ* contact is also observed significantly more in α-helices than in β-sheets or when no secondary structure is present, and has a uniqueness of 0.71, so within a sequential Ala–Ala fragment this type of contact is highly predictive of α-helical structure. The sequential Hα–Hβ* contact is, on the other hand, highly predictive of β-sheet with a uniqueness of 0.20, although it is on average mostly observed when no secondary structure is present (0.38). This illustrates that the uniqueness of a contact is strongly related to the prevalence of a particular sequence combination in a particular secondary structure element, and is not necessarily indicative of the kind of secondary structure element a particular contact usually occurs in. The information from the constraints and the coordinates show clear differences, as illustrated by comparison with some of the contacts described earlier. The H–Hβ* contact occurs quite often in β-sheets based on the coordinate data, with a median distance that is slightly higher than in α-helices (4.63 Å compared to 4.31 Å). The Hα–Hβ* contact, which would generally be difficult to identify due to overlap in the aliphatic region of a NOESY spectrum, is always present based on the coordinate data, but is only seen in 0.30 cases based on the constraints. These differences illustrate that the NOE constraint data not only incorporates distance information, but also encodes NMR-specific information such as the difficulty with which a particular contact can be assigned.

 + 3 contact between Hβ*–H, which occurs in 0.04 cases for β-sheets and 0.06 cases where secondary structure is absent. The binomial analysis indicates that the 0.06 fraction is observed significantly less, while it does not mark the 0.04 fraction. This is because this type of analysis is dependent on sample size (only 1 sample for the 0.04 fraction, 12 for the 0.06 fraction).

). All contacts with a separation of 5 residues or higher are very rarely observed in α-helices, but become highly prevalent for β-sheets (data not shown). The only exception to this are long range Hα–Hβ* and Hβ*–Hβ* contacts, which are seen in significantly higher percentages between α-helices as compared to the average.

Residue atom analysis
 on the website) shows that generally atoms are significantly higher assigned in α-helices and β-sheets, and lower when no secondary structure is present. This finding is not surprising as the secondary structure elements are defined by constraints, and the atoms have to be assigned to obtain those. Another general trend is that prochiral methylenes are within α-helices significantly more degenerated, i.e. the HB2 and HB3 atoms exists as a QB pseudoatom or an HB* type atom set. This type of analysis can be significantly improved by cleaning up the stereospecific assignment status based on the coordinates.

Discussion
In this analysis only the original data as deposited by the authors was used, and no attempt was made to ‘clean up’ and further interpret this information, except for linking the constraint with the coordinate data and removing identical sequences from the data set pool (where only the entry with the highest number of constraints linked to atoms was kept). This approach is intentional, as it best represents the quality and extent of the data that is currently deposited at the PDB. Only the distance constraint information was included in the analysis, and the information from dihedral, H-bond and RDC constraints was ignored. Even though these constraints contain important structural information, they were, as experimental data, recorded independently from the NOE data. They are used in the structure determination process, however, and it was not investigated whether their presence influences the quality of the final distance constraint lists. There are several other issues that can still be addressed, and although these are likely to improve some of the aspects of this type of study, it is also important to start with the original information so that a comparison point is available.

Distance distribution from the constraint information for sequential Ala–Ala contacts between backbone H protons




In this analysis a particular inter-atomic contact between two residues from one PDB entry is either observed or not observed. The reason why a contact is observed (or not) implicitly includes distance information, peak overlap, water exchange line broadening, and all other factors that can lead to not observing or assigning a contact during analysis of a spectrum. This is different from the traditional meaning of an ‘assigned atom’ on the chemical shift level, where it means that the chemical shift value for the resonance that arises from the atom is known. However, this does not necessarily mean that these assigned atoms produce any valid inter-atomic distance information. Thus, an ‘assigned atom’ (or residue) on the constraint level means that a chemical shift assignment also produced useful and valid information related to the inter-atomic distances within the molecule.

 used in this study for the constraint sets, with the exception that no distance cutoff is used (although some distance information is, as mentioned, implicitly included because the reason a constraint is observed or not is very dependent on distance), and that values are labelled as significant based on a binomial analysis. The uniqueness has the same definition, except that again it is based on the amount of constraints that are observed.
Also of interest is the relationship between the information that comes directly from the deposited constraints and the information that comes from the deposited coordinates. Here, the constraint information is compared to the distances from the originally deposited coordinates. Although a set of recalculated coordinates (as in RECOORD) or X-ray structures could have equally well been used, the originally deposited coordinates were chosen because they should best match the content of the constraint lists. All comparisons between constraint and coordinate information are intended for informative purposes only: the constraints represent the experimental NMR side of the information contained in the coordinates, and are in effect only a subset of the information contained therein. However, a dependable determination of whether a particular NOE contact is observed or not is not possible based on an NMR structural ensemble, but is trivial based on the constraints because they inherently contain NMR-specific information like signal overlap, dynamics, etc.

) X-ray structure based approach to obtain probabilities for assignments, the distance distributions for inter-atomic contacts are used to generate volume-based probabilities in addition to the atom identity based probabilities. This approach improves the probabilities that are generated, but it does require that the original peak list with volumes is available. This is not possible within the current analysis, although this will be pursued if a meaningful way to recalibrate the distance constraint bounds is available. This would also allow a better comparison between the NMR constraint data and any coordinate data (from NMR or X-ray structures).

Conclusion
A resource is now available where it is possible to check how likely a particular contact is when assigning NOESY spectra, or if a particular sequence fragment is likely to be difficult to assign. In this respect it formalises information that scientists with experience in spectrum analysis are aware of but cannot quantify. The amount of information provided here is extensive, however, and is even more useful when used as ‘knowledge based’ probabilities in automatic assignment strategies, to filter and/or validate ambiguous constraint possibilities, and as a tool to rank assignment possibilities in spectrum analysis programs. These are being implemented as part of the CCPN framework.
Finally, the NMR constraint lists encompass the experimental NMR data encoded in the NMR structural ensembles, and comprise a single set of data that is much easier to analyse than an ensemble of solutions. As such, they provide a reduced form of structural information that is relevant for NMR analysis only. For this reason, and to allow a basic level of scientific reproducibility and validation, it is important that constraints, and all other possible NMR derived information, are deposited along with the structure coordinates. It is very likely that a lot more information than described in this article can be gained from it, which in turn can assist the NMR community and can help to understand the relationships between NMR and structure.
