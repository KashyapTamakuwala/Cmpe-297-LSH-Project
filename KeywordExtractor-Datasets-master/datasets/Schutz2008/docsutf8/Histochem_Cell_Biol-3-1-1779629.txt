. Transgenic mice containing between one and seven transgene copies were generated by injection of the purified BAC-Col10a1- lLacZ DNA. X-gal staining of newborns and embryos revealed strong and robust LacZ activity exclusively in hypertrophic cartilage of the fetal and neonatal skeleton of the transgenic offspring. This indicates that expression of the reporter gene in its proper genomic context in the BAC Col10a1 environment is independent of the integration site and reflects authentic Col10a1 expression in vivo. The Col10a1 specific BAC recombination vector described here will enable the specific analysis of effector gene functions in hypertrophic cartilage during skeletal development, endochondral ossification, and fracture callus healing.

Introduction
Cartilage–bone transition by endochondral ossification is a highly complex process which determines not only longitudinal growth of long bones, ribs and vertebrae, but also plays a critical role in bone fracture callus healing, osteophyte formation and cartilage tissue engineering. Decisive steps in this process are proliferation, maturation and hypertrophy of chondrocytes in the growth plate which play a key role in mineralization, apoptosis and induction of resorption of hypertrophic cartilage by invading bone marrow. These events are regulated by synergistic action of several signaling pathways and transcriptions factors controlled by a multitude of growth factors and hormones.

Genotyping of transgenic mouse lines
Transgenic founder animals were selected by PCR of tail biopsies using primers pairs P1/P2 and P3/P4 (see above) detecting recombination events. Each sample was standardized by PCR using P1/P4 primer pair which generates a 538 bp fragment from the wt Col10a1 allele. Founders derived from injections of F1 hybrids were crossed with C57BL6, whereas founders derived from FVB oocytes were crossed with FVB mice. For genotyping of newborn mice and embryos DNA was extracted from skin or placenta, and transgene DNA was identified by PCR as above.

After prolonged staining, a non-specific reaction appeared in osteoclasts of long bones in transgenic and wildtype animals owing to endogenous galactosidase activity. Regardless of the transgene copy number, the LacZ activity in the offspring of all founders was seen persistently in all hypertrophic chondrocytes of the developing skeleton.

It may also indicate a high level of sensitivity to interfering activities of the genomic context of insertion. It is possible that the −4.6 kb promoter including the first intron contains essential silencing elements required for suppressing Col10a1 expression in non-hypertrophic cartilage and in non-chondrogenic tissues, but possibly lacks additional regulatory elements beyond the enhancer region.

). The expression pattern of LacZ, however, was very similar in all seven BAC lines analyzed so far, apparently independent of the integration sites and the copy number of the BAC transgene.
Most E14.5- to E16.5-day BAC-Col10a1-lacZ-neo transgenic embryos showed some X-gal staining in hair follicles of the forehead and snout, and of the epidermis of the tail, legs and shoulder, which disappears after birth. In the X-gal positive spots, staining was restricted to the basal layer of keratinocytes. Since these cells do not express type X collagen, the effect may be due to endogenous galactosidase activity, or a result of LacZ activation by other, Col10a1-unrelated regulatory elements located in the BAC clone.
In addition to Col10a1, the BAC clone RP23-192A7 contains coding regions of three additional genes Tspyl-1, Tspyl1-4 and Nt5dc1. Whether these genes are expressed under their endogenous promoters in the BAC transgenic mice is currently investigated. If they are expressed, they could affect the phenotype of the established transgenic mouse lines, but no phenotypic alteration in skeletal elements nor in other tissues have been observed in transgenic embryos, newborn or adults as compared to wildtype littermates.
The high intensity of X-gal staining under the control of the BAC-Col10a1 promoter allowed the visualization of discrete zones of Col10a1 expression in hypertrophic cartilage of anatomical structures not investigated so far in such detail and completeness, for example the skull or the inner and outer aspects of the thoracal and cervical vertebrae. The data presented in this study illustrate the superior potential of reporter gene expression analysis in combination with BAC recombineering technique as compared to conventional in situ hybridization analysis.

lacZ
-frt-neo-frt targeting vector may be an extremely versatile vector for the targeted overexpression of other genes in hypertrophic chondrocytes of growth plates with high efficiency and specificity. Thus, the Col10a1-based BAC vector may be a useful tool to analyze the role of effector genes in skeletal development, endochondral ossification, and fracture callus formation.
