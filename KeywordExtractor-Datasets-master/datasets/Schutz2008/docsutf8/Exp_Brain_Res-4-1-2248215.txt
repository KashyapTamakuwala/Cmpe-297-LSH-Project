Theta burst stimulation (TBS) is a special repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) paradigm, where bursts of low-intensity stimuli are applied in the theta frequency. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of neuronavigated TBS over primary somatosensory cortex (SI) on laser-evoked potentials (LEPs) and acute pain perception induced with Tm : YAG laser stimulation. The amplitude changes of the N1, N2, and P2 components of LEPs and related subjective pain rating scores of 12 healthy subjects were analyzed prior to and following continuous TBS (cTBS), intermittent TBS (iTBS), intermediate TBS (imTBS), and sham stimulation. Our results demonstrate that all active TBS paradigms significantly diminished the amplitude of the N2 component, when the hand contralateral to the site of TBS was laser-stimulated. Sham stimulation condition had no significant effect. The subjective pain perception also decreased during the experimental sessions, but did not differ significantly from the sham stimulation condition. The main finding of our study is that TBS over SI diminished the amplitude of the N2 component evoked from the contralateral side without any significant analgesic effects. Furthermore, imTBS produced responses similar to those observed by other forms of TBS induced excitability changes in the SI.

Methods
Subjects
Nineteen healthy volunteers between 18 and 35 years were informed about all aspects of the experiments and signed an informed consent. Three subjects chose not to continue the experiment after the first or second session and during off-line EEG analysis four further subjects were dropped out because of their hardly detectable LEP components. Hence, twelve of the subjects (six male, six female; mean age = 26.33 ± 3.17 years) were included in the final analysis. We conformed with the Declaration of Helsinki and the experimental protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Göttingen. None of the subjects suffered from chronic pain syndromes, nor took any medication regularly. None had a history of neurological or psychiatric illness. All of them participated in all four sessions, the three TBS and sham stimulations.

).
For AMT determination, the coil was placed tangentially to the scalp, with the handle pointing backwards and laterally 45° from mid-line. MEPs of the right abductor digiti minimi muscle (ADM) were recorded by Ag-AgCl-electrodes in a belly tendon-montage before each stimulation. The signals were amplified and filtered (1.59 Hz-1 kHz, sampling rate of 5 kHz), digitalized with a micro 1401 AD converter (Cambridge Electronic Design, Cambridge, UK), recorded by a computer using SIGNAL software (Cambridge Electronic Design, Version 2.13). Complete muscle relaxation was controlled though auditory and visual feedback of EMG activity. AMT was defined as the minimum intensity eliciting a MEP of a superior size when compared to spontaneous moderate muscular activity in at least three of six pulses.

). Skin temperature of the stimulated area was checked prior to every switch between hands, and corrected with a heating lamp if it fell below 35°C.

Psychophysical evaluation
We used the verbal analogue score (VAS) to assess the subjective intensity of pain. The subjects were instructed to pay attention to the laser stimuli and to rate the perceived pain verbally (1-warm, 1.1 smallest pain, and 1.9 most intense pain) about 2–3 s after each laser-impulse. The values were individually averaged separately for both hands in each session and conditions. The ears of the subjects were plugged during the measurements to avoid auditory artifacts accompanying laser stimulation.


Electrophysiological recordings
The EEG was recorded using a 64-channel montage applying 64 ring electrodes (inner diameter: 6 mm, outer diameter: 12 mm) (EasyCap; Falk and Minow GmbH, Münich, Germany). The electrodes were placed in accordance with the extended international 10–20 system. The impedance was kept <5 kΩ. The Fz was used as reference, the ground was placed 2 cm anterior to the tragus of the right ear. Data were collected at a sampling rate of 1,000 Hz with the BrainAmp system (Brain Products GmbH, Munich, Germany) and were analyzed offline. The obtained data were re-referenced to the connected mastoids (TP9-TP10). A 0.5 Hz low-cutoff as well as a 30 Hz high-cutoff filter was used. In addition to automatic artifact detection (200 μV amplitude criterion) all epochs were visually inspected, and those containing eye blinks or muscle movement artifacts were excluded. Baseline correction was performed on the basis of the 100 ms prestimulus interval. The amplitudes of N1 (referring to Fz) and N2–P2 (referring to TP9-TP10) components were measured.
Although we recorded data on 64 channels, we assessed LEPs according to the scalp distribution on the analyzed peaks. The N2 is a negative component (referring to TP9-TP10) was peaking around 160–240 ms. The amplitude of the early N1 negative peak which came before N2 on T7 and T8 channels (referring to Fz) was analyzed. The P2 positive component after N2 was peaking around 300–360 ms. The N2 component is largest over the lateral temporal and fronto-central areas on electrodes Fz, Cz, CPz, F1–F4, FC1–FC6, C1–C6, T7, T8, and CP1–CP6. In contrast, the P2 peak has its maximum amplitude over the vertex on electrodes FCz, Cz, CPz, Pz, F1–F4, FC1–FC4, C1–C4, CP1–CP4, and P1–P4. For the analysis of LEPs according to regional distribution, we defined three distinct areas with pooling the data: central (with all the mid-line electrodes such as Fz, FCz, Cz, CPz, and Pz), left (F3, FC3, C3, CP3, P3, FC5, C5, CP5, and T7) and right (electrodes according to the left side) instead of separate electrodes.

). Thus the LEP recording lasted for 8–10 min for the first hand and also for 8–10 min for the second hand laser-stimulation. In all three TBS and sham TBS conditions, the right hand was stimulated first in half of the cases and the left hand was stimulated first in the other half. This order was kept for the subjects for all conditions. After baseline LEP recording the AMT was measured (∼15–20 min) and the TBS were applied for 40–190 s through the cap. After TBS the impedance of the EEG electrodes were retested and corrected below 5 kΩ if it was necessary. The TBS was followed by a post-stimulation LEP recording in ∼5 min after TBS. Thus, the interval between the two LEP recordings with regard to the same hand was about 30–35 min including all subjects and conditions.
The experimental sessions were separated from each other by at least 5 days. The subjects were blinded as to the type of magnetic stimulation. The order of the sessions was randomized across subjects.

). In summary, these results suggest that cTBS has an inhibitory effect on non-motor areas; whereas the effect of iTBS is more facilitatory, but clearer results have still to emerge. Our results are the first demonstrating that all three TBS paradigms, but not by sham stimulation over the SI resulted in similar after-effects regarding the amplitude of the N2 component of LEPs evoked by the laser stimulation of the contralateral hand.

In our experiment the subjects were asked to pay attention to each laser stimuli and since the TBS and sham condition were applied in a randomized order and the subjects were blinded as to the type of magnetic stimulation, the significant difference between sham and the other three TBS on the N2 amplitude is more than simply habituation or the effect of the different attentional states.

), implying that it should not be used in further studies as ‘sham’ condition, at least with regard to LEPs and when it is applied over the SI. However these results are not directly comparable with the effects of TBS on M1, thus further studies are needed to clarify the effects of imTBS on different cortical areas. Future studies should also clarify the effectiveness of the different TBS paradigms applied over the M1 and non-motor cortical areas, such as the SII on acute pain perception and in chronic pain.
