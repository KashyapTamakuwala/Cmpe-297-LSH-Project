Aims/hypothesis
Changes in cardiac substrate utilisation leading to altered energy metabolism may underlie the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy. We studied cardiomyocyte substrate uptake and utilisation and the role of the fatty acid translocase CD36 in relation to in vivo cardiac function in rats fed a high-fat diet (HFD).

Methods
Rats were exposed to an HFD or a low-fat diet (LFD). In vivo cardiac function was monitored by echocardiography. Substrate uptake and utilisation were determined in isolated cardiomyocytes.

Results

N
-succinimidyloleate, LCFA uptake and esterification were similar in LFD and HFD cardiomyocytes. In HFD hearts CD36 was relocated to the sarcolemma, and basal phosphorylation of a mediator of CD36-trafficking, i.e. protein kinase B (PKB/Akt), was increased.

Conclusions/interpretation
Feeding rats an HFD induced cardiac contractile dysfunction, which was accompanied by the relocation of CD36 to the sarcolemma, and elevated basal levels of phosphorylated PKB/Akt. The permanent presence of CD36 at the sarcolemma resulted in enhanced rates of LCFA uptake and myocardial triacylglycerol accumulation, and may contribute to the development of insulin resistance and diabetic cardiomyopathy.

Diets
 Experimental diets were obtained from Hope Farms (Woerden, the Netherlands; HFD, catalogue no. 4148.02; LFD, catalogue no. 4148.01). The LFD consisted of 8% by weight of total fat, 22% by weight of protein and 60% by weight of carbohydrate; the HFD contained 25% by weight of fat, 32% by weight of protein and 25% by weight of carbohydrate, as well as more palmitate (91.12 g/kg) and oleate (100.24 g/kg) compared with the LFD (29.12 and 32.08 g/kg, respectively). In the group fed the HFD, 50.4% of the ingested calories were derived from fat compared with 16.4% in the group fed the LFD.

 < 0.05). Collectively, these results indicate that increased activity of PKB/Akt may underlie CD36 redistribution to the sarcolemma, and that these events precede the LV dysfunction induced by HFD feeding.

Discussion
Here we report that HFD feeding induces cardiac contractile dysfunction in rats and that this is associated with a permanent relocation of CD36 to the sarcolemma. The continuous presence of CD36 at the sarcolemmal membrane results in enhanced rates of LCFA uptake and subsequent esterification. We propose that this contributes to a decrease in myocardial insulin action and the development of diabetes-related heart disease. In addition, we show that AMPK-mediated responses are not affected by the composition of the diet.
A key observation in this study is that the alterations in cardiac contractile function in HFD hearts was associated with a continuous presence of CD36 at the sarcolemmal membrane. The present study provides the first morphological evidence for translocation of CD36 to the sarcolemmal membrane. Importantly, the amount of sarcolemmal CD36 closely correlated with enhanced LCFA uptake rates in isolated cardiomyocytes. The observation that SSO inhibited LCFA uptake in HFD cardiomyocytes to the same residual levels as measured in LFD cardiomyocytes provides further pharmacological evidence that the enhanced flux of LCFA in the heart of HFD-fed rats is a direct consequence of the relocalisation of CD36 to the sarcolemmal membrane.

], insulin-mediated CD36 translocation to the mitochondria has never been reported and even seems counterintuitive. Collectively, the available evidence strongly supports the idea that the observed CD36 immunoreactivity can be ascribed to CD36 located at the sarcolemma rather than in subsarcolemmal mitochondria.

] and have been linked to reduced oxidative capacity and lipid accumulation in skeletal muscle from patients with type 2 diabetes. However, further studies are required to examine whether these changes contribute to the reduced basal LCFA oxidation and increased LCFA esterification rates, or whether the extra LCFA taken up by HFD cells are stored as triacylglycerol and phospholipids as a consequence of HFD-induced changes in enzymes promoting LCFA esterification or inhibition of lipolysis.

], we show that HFD feeding reduces insulin responsiveness and impairs metabolic flexibility, as illustrated by the blunted effects of insulin on the stimulation of glucose uptake, phosphorylation of PRAS40, LCFA uptake and translocation of CD36 to the sarcolemma.
We conclude that HFD feeding in rats induces cardiac contractile dysfunction, which is preceded by relocation of CD36 to the sarcolemma, and elevated basal levels of phosphorylated PKB/Akt. The continuous presence of CD36 at the sarcolemma contributes to enhanced rates of fatty acid uptake, resulting in myocardial triacylglycerol accumulation and accompanying insulin resistance. Collectively, these data suggest that alterations in the subcellular localisation of CD36 may contribute to the development of diabetes-related heart disease and that CD36 may be a therapeutic target to prevent cardiac dysfunction and the development of heart failure in diabetes.
