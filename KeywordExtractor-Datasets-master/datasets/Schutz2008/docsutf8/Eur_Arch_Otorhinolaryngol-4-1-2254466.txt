The aim of this study was to investigate the management and prognostic determinants of recurrent pleomorphic adenoma (RPA). A retrospective analysis was performed to examine the clinical features, the prevalence of surgical complications, and new recurrences of RPA. Tumor recurrence rate was estimated by the Kaplan–Meier method, and the prognostic value of some of the variables was tested by univariate analysis using the log rank test. The study focused on 33 patients, 18 female (54.5%) and 15 male (45.5%), aged 12–71 years (median 41). A total or extended total parotidectomy was performed in 16 cases (48.5%), a superficial parotidectomy in 10 cases (30.3%), and a local excision in 7 cases (21.2%). In ten patients (30.3%), a branch or the trunk of the facial nerve was deliberately sacrificed. Major complications included one unexpected definitive paralysis of the marginal mandibular branch of the facial nerve and 14 cases of Frey syndrome. Follow-up varied from 2 to 25 years (median 10.5 years), and there were 11 new recurrences (33.3%) within a period varying from 1 to 16 years (median 6 years). The estimated tumor recurrence rates were 14.1 ± 6.6% at 5 years, 31.4 ± 9.4% at 10 years, 43.0 ± 10.8% at 15 years, and 57.2 ± 14.8% at 20 years. Presence of a multinodular lesion and the type of intervention performed were significantly associated with a higher probability of recurrence. RPAs are prone to new recurrences, especially when multinodular and treated with a local excision. Surgical treatment should include facial nerve resection in selected cases. Follow-up for the patient’s lifetime is warranted.

The present study was undertaken to address these important issues based on a follow-up period of up to 20 years. Here, we present our findings and review some of the more recent literature.

Materials and methods
A retrospective analysis of the charts of patients treated for benign parotid neoplasm between 1983 and 2004 was performed to identify those patients operated on for RPA. We collected information on patient demographics and clinical history, clinical features of the lesions, diagnostic work-up, the type of surgery, operative findings, facial nerve management, and adjuvant treatment.
The study analyzed the prevalence of surgical complications and new recurrences. Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS statistical package. Tumor recurrence rate was estimated by the Kaplan–Meier method: the entry point was the date of surgery for a recurrent tumor seen for the first time in our department, and the end point was the date of a new recurrence or the date of last consultation for censored observations.
The prognostic value of certain categorical variables (age, gender, number of previous operations, type of previous operation, lobe of origin, type of surgery performed for RPA, maximum diameter, facial nerve resection, presence of a pseudocapsule at the surgical margins, rupture of the pseudocapsule, number of neoplastic nodules, postoperative radiotherapy) was tested by univariate analysis using the log rank test.

Ultrasonography was the most frequently used diagnostic tool (23 patients, 69.7%), followed by fine needle aspiration biopsy in 21 (63.6%) patients, magnetic resonance imaging in 14 (42.4%), computed tomography in 3 (9.1%), and sialography in 2 (6.1%). The different types of diagnostic procedures employed reflect the multi-decade period analyzed. At present, after ultrasonography, which is routinely adopted for follow-up, magnetic resonance imaging is used to delineate the extension of the recurrent lesions.
In 12 (36.4%) patients, the lesion involved the superficial lobe of the parotid gland, in 9 (27.3%) both lobes, and in 12 (36.4%) only the deep lobe was involved. In 5 (15.2%) patients the lesion also extended to the parapharyngeal space. Information on multinodularity of the lesion could be obtained for 31 patients: multiple lesions were observed in 24 (77.4%) of them.

), just two were significantly associated with the likelihood of developing a new recurrence: local excision of the RPA instead of a formal parotidectomy and the presence of multinodular disease. To date, no new recurrences have been observed for uninodular recurrences. There was a trend toward increased risk of a new recurrence for deep-lobe localization, although it was not statistically significant.

Conclusion
The management of RPA is a major challenge for the clinician. RPAs, particularly multinodular tumors, are prone to new recurrences especially when treatment of the initial tumor is performed according to currently accepted standards. MRI is considered to be the best tool to delineate the extension of the lesion, although it can miss microscopic nodules. Options for management include pure observation, not only for the elderly or infirm, but also in cases of small lesions until they begin to grow. When surgery is elected, it should be tailored to the single patient, because even if on one side a limited local excision is considered acceptable, on the other side a total or extended parotidectomy may be inadequate to control an RPA adjacent to the nerve. In these cases, facial nerve resection and reconstruction must also be considered and discussed with the patient in the preoperative counseling. Postoperative radiotherapy is an option, particularly for older patients for whom the risk of inducing other malignancies is considered to be low. Follow-up for patients treated for RPA should be done with regular ultrasonography for the lifetime of the patient and with magnetic resonance in selected cases with deep lobe or parapharyngeal involvement. All patients should be informed about the possibility of the need for multiple treatment procedures.
