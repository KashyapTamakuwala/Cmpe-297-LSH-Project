Aims
In this study we evaluated indicators of the feasibility, reliability, and validity of the Child Health Questionnaire-Child Form (CHQ-CF). We compared the results in a subgroup of adolescents who completed the standard paper version of the CHQ-CF with the results in another subgroup of adolescents who completed an internet version, i.e., an online, web-based CHQ-CF questionnaire.

Methods
Under supervision at school, 1,071 adolescents were randomized to complete the CHQ-CF and items on chronic conditions by a paper questionnaire or by an internet administered questionnaire.

Results

Conclusion
This study supports the feasibility, internal consistency reliability of the scales, and construct validity of the CHQ-CF administered by either a paper questionnaire or online questionnaire. Given Cohen’s suggested guidelines for the interpretation of effect sizes, i.e., 0.20–.50 indicates a small effect, differences in CHQ-CF scale scores between paper and internet administration can be considered as negligible or small.

In this study, we compared indicators of the feasibility, reliability, and validity of the CHQ-CF in a subgroup of adolescents who completed the standard paper version of the CHQ-CF with the same indicators in another subgroup of adolescents who completed a newly developed internet version of the questionnaire. Additionally, we compared the mean CHQ-CF scores and distributions of the scale scores between both subgroups. A randomized parallel group design was applied in a large adolescent population (13–7  years old), ensuring that both subgroups were comparable.
the number of missing answers (indicator of feasibility),

the distribution of the scale scores including mean scale scores in the whole sample and in gender and age specific subgroups,

the internal consistency reliability of multi-item scales (indicator of reliability),

the ability of the CHQ-CF to discriminate between subgroups with and without self-reported chronic conditions (indicator of construct validity).




Methods
Study population
In 2003, 1,071  students in 55  classes of various educational levels in the 3rd year of seven secondary schools (13–7 years old) in the area of Vlaardingen (metropolitan area) and Harderwijk (rural area), The Netherlands, were invited to complete the Child Health Questionnaire Child Form (CHQ-CF). The parents and students each received written information about the study several weeks before data collection; parents could refuse their child’s participation, and participation by the students was voluntary.

Randomization
Within each school class, students were randomly assigned to either the paper or the internet mode of administration using SPSS-generated random numbers. Students completed the questionnaires, either on paper or online in a classroom with computers linked to the internet, under the supervision of a research assistant; the students were allowed adequate privacy.

Discussion and conclusions
In this study we applied a randomized design to compare the results of the Child Health Questionnaire-Child Form (CHQ-CF) administered by a paper questionnaire and by an online questionnaire. The results provided support for the feasibility, internal consistency reliability, and construct validity of the CHQ-CF scales. Both modes of questionnaire administration yielded comparable scale scores and showed comparable psychometric properties. Additionally, the study provided reference/norm scores for clinical studies (general population of 13–7 year olds).
Strengths of the current study
34
]. Randomization to either the paper or internet mode of administration of the CHQ-CF was successful with respect to the evaluated characteristics.

Limitations
25
35
7
35
]. Despite the logistical and the above-mentioned methodological challenges, we recommend future studies comparing the paper and internet versions of the CHQ-CF applying a randomized crossover design to evaluate congruency of answers to CHQ-CF items at the individual level.
In this study, internet and paper questionnaires were completed in a controlled environment with adequate privacy and supervision. This may not be the case during future applications. We are unaware of the impact less privacy during completion of the questionnaires may have, but this would apply to both the paper and the internet versions of the questionnaire.

3
]. Test-retest reliability of the CHQ-CF and its responsiveness and sensitivity to changes in health were not evaluated in the current study. The CHQ-CF has a relatively large number of items; therefore, we recommend developing a shorter version in the future.

Psychometric properties
The psychometric properties, with only a few exceptions, were equal between the two modes of questionnaire administration. The Cronbach’s α of the scale “physical functioning–in the subgroup administered the paper version of the questionnaire was just under 0.70, and the difference with the alpha in the subgroup administered the internet version was not statistically significant.

Missing values

]. This study provides no explanations for the established small score differences between paper and internet administration, or for the established statistically significant, but small interaction effects of administration mode with age in the case of four CHQ-CF scales.


Conclusions
With increasing application of online health questionnaires rather than questionnaires on paper, especially in adolescent populations, it should be noted that comparison of results requires that the scores between these modes of administration do not show meaningful statistically significant differences. This study showed that, overall, paper and internet versions of the CHQ-CF yielded only a few, negligible or small, differences. Paper and internet modes of CHQ-CF administration may be combined in a single study, although researchers should consider the possibility of minor score differences depending on the mode of administration for some scales. We recommend repeated studies in other populations, including clinical populations, to confirm or reject our results.
