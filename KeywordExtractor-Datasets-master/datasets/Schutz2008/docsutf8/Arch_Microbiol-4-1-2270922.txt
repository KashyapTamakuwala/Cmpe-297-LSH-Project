). In actuality, the functional characteristics and relative abundance of proteins measured are derived from a heterogeneous cell population including cells in various stages of growth that are potentially expressing a range of metabolic states within relatively short time periods. We argue that the term “aerobic shake flask,” therefore, is more an operational description than an accurate description of the physiological growth conditions.

), temperature, agitation, and the incoming gas flow rate and composition can be monitored and controlled. Because the nutrient medium can be of variable composition and added to the bioreactor at discreet rates, cells can be cultured with varying degrees of electron donor/carbon source or electron acceptor limitation and over a range of growth rates. The former has important ramifications given the effects of these limitations on cell physiology, while being able to address the issue of different growth rates enables studies that more closely mimic the variable and potentially long generation times typical of many habitats including sedimentary and aquatic environments. A complete mass (fermentation) balance can also be obtained by measuring biogenic gases produced during the cultivation by using in-line mass spectrometry (MS) in addition to the byproducts of carbon and energy source metabolism and the amount of produced biomass. The utilization of such advanced technologies are allowing for unprecedented insights into the metabolic complexities of microbiological systems.

) and reducing the gas effect on pH. Any change in pH that occurs during cell growth due to non-gaseous metabolic by-products is compensated for by monitoring probes and the addition of acid or base (typically HCl or NaOH) via computer controlled pumps. While there is a greater upfront capital investment for bioreactors, the investment is minor relative to the expense associated with high-throughput functional genomics techniques.
Systems biology seeks to integrate high-throughput and comprehensive analytical techniques such as DNA and RNA microarrays, proteomics and protein interaction analyses, and metabolite measurements with computational biology (i.e., modeling) to describe the structure of the system and responses to individual perturbations. Such knowledge can be used, for example, to predict systems level responses to environmental changes/perturbations. In our opinion, a key element of systems microbiology research is the use of controlled cultivation techniques to generate samples under well-defined conditions where variations in intra- as well as inter-culture variability, are minimized.

). However, this is the first report documenting the metabolic differences with varied electron-acceptor between cultures. Finally, while others have utilized steady state cultures and cite advantages similar to those mentioned above, this is, to our knowledge, the first report that assesses and quantifies the effect of cultivation methods on microbial physiology and cell proteome.

Recent work in our laboratory shows that a SLiC score of at least 0.7 is sufficiently rigorous (unpublished) and is used herein. Further, at least one high-confidence “unique” peptide (i.e., mapping to only one possible parent protein) and a total of two peptides was required for protein identification in each analysis.

Although the order of appearance and disappearance of the organic acids was the same between the flask culture replicates, the rate of lactate consumption varied significantly as did the transient concentrations of pyruvate and acetate. The differences in these profiles presumably reflect the metabolic variability between cultures at any given point along the growth curve, and may result from increased variability in the mass transfer kinetics in poorly mixed cultures compared to controlled batch.

Separately, differences in acetate concentrations of the replicate shake flask cultures compared to controlled batch and chemostat cultures indicated that such differences may well have promoted additional biological variability.

 uptake rates in shake flask cultures will cause a temporal shift in carbon source usage and electron flux. Such shifts can be expected to result in variable metabolic, transcriptomic and proteomic profiles between independent shake flask cultures if only a small number (1–3) of samples are taken, since one culture may have exhausted a carbon source and consequently shifted metabolism and electron flow while the “biological replicate” has not.

). Thus, the shake flask cultures in the experiments described here must have included cells experiencing a lack of oxygen due to the nutrient depletion that is an inherent complication of such cultures, resulting in a greater range of expressed proteins.
Achieving a systems-level understanding of microorganisms, including the underlying metabolic and regulatory networks that control cell physiology and the ability to predict responses to perturbations, is indeed an ambitious goal. Systems biology takes full advantage of the state-of-the-science technology and genomic information, with the scientific as well as the practical benefits expected to be plentiful. Our results emphasize that functional genomics can greatly benefit from well-defined and homogeneous cell cultures provided by controlled cultivation techniques. The use of controlled cultivation techniques ensures that the large and comprehensive datasets used in systems biology research are derived from well-characterized and homogeneous biological samples, thus reducing the inherent variability that often complicates drawing biological conclusions and will allow for more accurate and robust identifications of metabolic and regulatory networks.
