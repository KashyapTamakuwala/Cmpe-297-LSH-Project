An overview is presented on the application of surface-enhanced infrared absorption (SEIRA) spectroscopy to biochemical problems. Use of SEIRA results in high surface sensitivity by enhancing the signal of the adsorbed molecule by approximately two orders of magnitude and has the potential to enable new studies, from fundamental aspects to applied sciences. This report surveys studies of DNA and nucleic acid adsorption to gold surfaces, development of immunoassays, electron transfer between metal electrodes and proteins, and protein–protein interactions. Because signal enhancement in SEIRA uses surface properties of the nano-structured metal, the biomaterial must be tethered to the metal without hampering its functionality. Because many biochemical reactions proceed vectorially, their functionality depends on proper orientation of the biomaterial. Thus, surface-modification techniques are addressed that enable control of the proper orientation of proteins on the metal surface.

]. Typical approaches of bio-nanotechnology are constructions of hybrid devices in which bio-molecules, e.g. DNA or proteins, are combined with a solid sensing and/or actuating substrate, for example as an electrode. With this architecture the whole bandwidth of biological functions can be addressed by exchange of signals with the sensor/actuator. The concept of the hybrid bio-device is key to the development of biosensors for DNA or proteins, or for immunoassays on a chip, etc. This concept is, moreover, valuable not only for technological progress but also for fundamental studies on proteins and other biologically active materials. Triggering the properties of the adsorbate on the substrate enables functional studies of biomolecules. A critical issue in the design of such a device is assessment of the interface between biomaterial and substrate in which the essential signal relay between the two different materials occurs. This signal relay comprises only small amounts of monolayer molecules at the interfaces which are difficult to detect by conventional Raman and IR techniques. Spectroscopic distinction from the strong background of the bulk is also difficult. This obstacle is overcome by exploiting the “optical near-field effect” of surface-enhanced spectroscopy in which the signal enhancement is restricted to the interface. Characteristic of vibrational techniques, SERS and SEIRA provide a wealth of molecular information on the level of a single chemical bond.

, depending on the size of the protein). Resolving the small difference bands requires acute spectroscopic sensitivity, in particular when surface-enhanced infrared difference spectroscopy (SEIDAS) is performed on a protein monolayer.
In this report, we review applications of SEIRA in which biochemical processes were studied. Because SEIRAS was introduced to the field of biomolecules only recently, we consider it worthwhile to start with practical aspects of the method.

]. Colloidal gold is prepared by reducing tetrachloroauric(III) acid with sodium citrate. It is also commercially available in different particle sizes. Typically, 10–50 nm colloidal gold is chosen. A major difference from the metal thin-film method is that the sample is attached to the colloidal gold suspension before measurement. The colloidal gold is then collected on an optical substrate by filtration or by centrifugation. The sample/colloid gold is measured either in the transmission configuration (with an IR card) or dried on an ATR prism.

Although Ge matches well with Ag or Cu, combination with Au may cause a decrease in the enhancement factor, because of the formation of a Ge–Au alloy at the boundary which strongly affects the morphology of the island structure of the film.

The CME surface can be conveniently prepared by the so-called “SAM (self-assembled monolayer) method” in which the SEIRA-active metal substrate is immersed in a solution containing the crosslinker molecule (normally for between 10 min and 2 h, depending on size of the molecule). The SAM of the crosslinker is formed spontaneously by quasi-covalent bonding between the sulfur and the metal surface. The substrate is then thoroughly rinsed with the solvent so that a SAM of the crosslinker remains on the metal substrate.

This base-pairing occurs at potentials higher than 0.1 V (relative to the SCE), at which the N1 of adenine is deprotonated and orientated toward the solution. This result implies that hydrogen-bonding between the base pairs can be controlled by the applied electrode potential.

The colloidal gold system is more convenient and less expensive means of preparation than coating by sputtering. Filtration of the colloidal particles on disposable IR cards is also a rapid, easy, and cost-effective means of producing a SEIRA substrate which operates in transmission mode and does not require complicated optical arrangements.

SEIRAS to probe protein functionality
The metal used for surface enhancement, can also be used as an electrode. The enzymatic reactions of many biological systems, especially those of membrane proteins, are driven by an electrochemical gradient across the cell membrane. Such a system can be artificially reproduced on an electrode surface to mimic the physiological properties of a biological membrane.

Studies of molecular and protein recognition
The acute sensitivity of SEIRAS is particularly useful when the technique is applied to studies of membrane proteins. Handling of the membrane proteins usually requires great care, because of their sensitivity to degeneration as soon as they are separated from the native lipid bilayer. The large size of the proteins also makes it difficult to control their orientation.
A successful strategy for immobilization of membrane proteins is to attach the purified protein, by using the selective affinity of a genetically introduced histidine tag (His-tag), to a nickel-chelating nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) monolayer (SAM) self-assembled on a chemically modified gold surface. The lipid environment of the surface-anchored membrane protein is subsequently restored by in-situ dialysis of the detergent around the amphiphilic membrane protein. This approach results in orientated immobilization and reconstitution of the native matrix, which enhances the stability of the membrane protein and restores full functionality.

]. In this report, SEIRA was used to determine the adsorption kinetics of PS2 on the Ni-NTA-modified Au surface. On illumination of the surface-bound PS2 a photocurrent was generated. The action spectrum corresponds to the absorption spectrum of PS2, indicating that the observed photocurrent is caused by photoreaction of PS2.
This methodology is a general approach for immobilization of proteins, because the introduction of affinity tags is routine with modern genetic techniques. Other tags beyond the His-tag may also be an option. Thus, orientational control of protein adsorption on a solid surface can be conveniently achieved. An oriented sample is mandatory when the vectorial function of membrane proteins is addressed. Many membrane proteins are asymmetric in their functionality, because they translocate ions or solutes preferentially in one direction or because their stimulant, e.g. ligand, binding partner protein, membrane potential, etc., affects the protein from one side only.


Summary and outlook
Despite the accomplishments reported in this article, studies of biomaterials by SEIRA is still in its infancy. Potential-induced difference spectroscopy using SEIRA is a promising possibility for study of the functionality of proteins. The stimulus in such studies is not limited to the electric trigger, as reviewed here, but can also be light illumination, temperature jump, or chemical induction. Many protein functions can be addressed by these means and the mechanism of action of these molecular machines may be resolved down to the level of a single bond.
