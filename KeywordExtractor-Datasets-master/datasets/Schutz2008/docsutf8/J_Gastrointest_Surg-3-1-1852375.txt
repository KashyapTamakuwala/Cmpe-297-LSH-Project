Behçet’s disease accompanied by intestinal involvement is called intestinal Behçet’s disease. The intestinal ulcers of Behçet’s disease are usually multiple and scattered and tend to perforate easily, so that many patients require emergency operation. The aim of this study is to determine the extent of surgical resection necessary to prevent reperforation and to point out the findings of concurrent oral and genital ulcers and multiple intestinal perforations in all patients of our series. During a 25-year study period, information of 125 Behçet’s disease cases was gathered. Among the 82 patients who were diagnosed with intestinal Behçet’s disease, 22 cases had intestinal perforations needing emergency laparotomy. We investigated and analyzed these cases according to the patients’ demographic characteristics, clinical presentations, laboratory data, and surgical outcome. There were 14 men and 8 women ranging from 22 to 65 years of age. Nine cases were diagnosed preoperatively, and the diagnoses were confirmed in all 22 cases during the surgical intervention. Surgical resection was performed in every patient, with right hemicolectomy and ileocecal resection in 11 cases, partial ileum resection in 8 cases with two reperforations, and ileocecal resection in 3 cases with one reperforation.

In 13 of these 22 cases, the diagnosis was confirmed at surgical resection for multiple perforations. Nine of the 22 cases had Behçet’s disease with intestinal involvement, which was confirmed preoperatively, six were confirmed by endoscopic examination; two by radiological examination; and one patient had gastrointestinal symptoms of intermittent abdominal pain, diarrhea, and nausea.

Results
Patient Characteristics
There were 14 men and 8 women in the 22 cases investigated. The ages of the patients with perforated intestinal Behçet’s disease ranged from 22 to 65 years, with a mean age of 35.3 years. The age at onset of symptoms of Behçet’s disease varied from 18 to 64 years on diagnosis, with a mean age of 33.1 years.

Operative Treatment and Outcome
All 22 perforated intestinal Behçet’s disease cases were confirmed at operation, with nine of them correctly diagnosed preoperatively. Surgical resection of the perforated intestinal ulcers was done in all cases, with right hemicolectomy and ileocecal resection in 11 cases, partial ileum resection in 8 cases, and ileocecal resection in 3 cases. No reperforation occurred in the group of patients who underwent right hemicolectomy and ileocecal resection. However, two reperforations ocurred in patients who underwent partial ileum resection alone and one in the ileocecal resection group.

After operation on these 22 patients with Behçet’s disease and intestinal perforation, four patients died during the postoperative course due to septic shock, which was present prior to the surgical intervention; three died from complications of hypertension and diabetes mellitus; and three were lost to follow-up. Thus, only 12 patients are still under observation, without evidence of gastrointestinal complications up to this date. The remaining 60 cases of intestinal Behçet’s disease, without perforations, are still under surveillance.

. In our series, all patients had manifestations of concurrent oral ulceration. All perforated cases present oral or genital ulcerations at the same time. Because we warned that patients of intestinal Behçet’s disease may have abdominal pain and oral or genital ulcerations concurrently, intestinal perforations should always be kept in mind.
