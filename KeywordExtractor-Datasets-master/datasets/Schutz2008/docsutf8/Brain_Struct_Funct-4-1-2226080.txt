The maternal separation paradigm has been applied to C57BL/6J mice as an animal developmental model for understanding structural deficits leading to abnormal behaviour. A maternal separation (MS) model was used on postnatal day (PND) 9, where the pups were removed from their mother for 24 h (MS24). When the pups were 10 weeks old, the level of anxiety and fear was measured with two behavioural tests; an open field test and an elevated plus maze test. The Barnes platform maze was used to test spatial learning, and memory by using acquisition trials followed by reverse trial sessions. The MS24 mice spent more time in the open arms of the elevated plus maze compared to controls, but no other treatment differences were found in the emotional behavioural tests. However, in the reverse trial for the Barnes maze test there was a significant difference in the frequency of visits to the old goal, the number of errors made by the MS24 mice compared to controls and in total distance moved. The mice were subsequently sacrificed and the total number of neurons estimated in the hippocampus using the optical fractionator. We found a significant loss of neurons in the dentate gyrus in MS mice compared to controls. Apparently a single maternal separation can impact the number of neurons in mouse hippocampus either by a decrease of neurogenesis or as an increase in neuron apoptosis. This study is the first to assess the result of maternal separation combining behaviour and stereology.

), we used PND 9 as the day of separation equivalent to Ellenbroek and co-workers day of choice in the rat. We tested if a 24-h maternal separation on PND 9 can cause an adult phenotype characterized by altered levels of activity and anxiety, learning and memory dysfunction, deficits in behavioural flexibility (reversal deficits) as well as changes in number of neurons in the hippocampus and its subregions in the mouse brain.

Material and methods
Animals
The offspring of 4 male and 8 female C57BL/6J mice (8 weeks old) obtained from Taconic Europe (Taconic Farms Inc., DK) were used in this study. The animals were acclimatized to the animal facility for 1 week. Multiparous females were used, since there is a higher rate of offspring survival. The animals were housed under a 12:12 h light/dark cycle (lights on at 6 a.m.) with constant temperature (21 ± 2°C) and humidity (52 ± 2%) in Macrolon type III cages with environmental enrichment in the form of wood splints bedding (aspen 4HV), wood shavings, 1 piece of Aspen Corner 15, 1 standard mouse house made of recycled cardboard, 1 aspen chewing stick size medium, and pads of nesting material (all obtained from Brogaarden, DK). Food (Altromin pills NR 1324) and tap water were available ad libitum. Two females were placed in a male’s cage for a period of 1 week to ensure conception, followed by separation of the two females to their own cages.

Maternal separation

 = 16, 9 males and 7 females), or to standard facility rearing (SFR). For the behavioural testing, 16 MS animals (4 males and 6 females) and 5 SFR animals (2 males and 3 females) were included, while 12 of the MS animals (2 males and 10 females) and 7 control animals (2 males and 5 females) were used for cell counting. Litters were not culled or sexed at birth to minimize the handling of the pups, but male and female pups were separated at weaning (PND 28) and group housed with their siblings, which resulted in 2–5 mice per cage. The environmental enrichment applied to the mothers was also applied to the MS and control animals.
The 24-h deprivation was carried out on PND 9 starting at 8 a.m. The pups remained in the home cage but were placed in a separate room with the same temperature, humidity and lighting conditions as the home stable. The cage was placed on a heating pad, which had a constant temperature of 31°C. No food or water was available during the separation. The dam was placed in a cage with similar facilities as the home cage in the home stable. The pups were checked every 3 h, using a red light during the night. Body weights were recorded before and after separation. Immediately after 24 h the dams were returned to the home cage and reunited with the pups.

). Behaviour was analysed using EthoVision (Noldus, Groeningen, The Netherlands). All behavioural testing took place between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m.

Open field test (OFT)
The open field consisted of a circular wooden platform (diameter 90 cm) surrounded by a 43 cm high wall with a camera mounted directly above. A central circle of 31 cm diameter was defined in the behaviour analysis software. Three 60-W light bulbs illuminated the arena. On the day of testing each animal was transported in a cardboard box to the centre of the open field and behaviour was recorded for 10 min. After the trial the maze was cleaned with a solution of acetic acid and soap water and faecal boli were counted.
The following parameters were calculated; total distance moved (cm), time spent in central circle and time spent in peripheral zone (expressed as % of session duration).

Elevated plus maze
The plus maze was elevated 50 cm above the ground and consisted of two opposing open arms (21 cm × 8 cm) connected by a central square (8 cm × 8 cm) to two opposing enclosed arms of the same size with 32 cm high walls. A video camera placed above the maze recorded the animals’ behaviour. On the day of testing, the animal was placed in the centre of the maze and behaviour was recorded for 10 min. Between trials the maze was cleaned as described for the OFT. The following parameters were calculated; total duration (s) in open and closed arms, the number of entries into the open and closed arms and the total distance moved (cm). From these parameters the ratio of entries into the open arms to the total number of arm entries, and the ratio of time spent in the open arms to time spent in both open and closed arms was calculated.

Test for spatial memory; Barnes maze
The Barnes maze (Barnes 1975) consisted of a circular, white-coated platform 90 cm in diameter and elevated 50 cm over the ground. Sixteen 5 cm wide holes were evenly distributed around the perimeter, 2.5 cm from the edge. A pair of rails was placed under two opposing holes to hold the hidden escape box. The escape box was a dark plastic storage box with a 5 cm diameter hole in the lid. A dark cylindrical cardboard tube (7.5 cm × 7 cm high) with a lid was used as the transport and start chamber.
Three 60-W bulbs illuminating the maze and high irregular rock and techno music played from a computer in a random manner provided the aversive stimuli. As with the previous test, a digital video camera mounted above the maze recorded animal’s behaviours.

Shaping
For 2 days before testing commenced, the animals were trained to enter the hidden escape box. Using the transport cylinder, the mouse was placed near the edge of the target hole with the hidden escape box underneath. Two cardboard walls blocked entry to adjacent holes. Only dim lightning and no noise was used during this phase of the experiment. The animal was allowed 5 min to enter the escape box and if this failed, it was placed manually inside. When the animal entered the box it was quickly carried to the home cage.

Acquisition trials
Six consecutive trials were given, one per day. The animal was placed in the transport cylinder, oriented in a random direction, in the centre of the maze. The aversive stimuli were turned on and the cylinder removed. Recording in the behaviour-observation software began immediately after the experimenter had left the room. The trial ended after 5 min or when the animal entered the hidden escape box. If the animal failed to enter the box or re-entered the maze after recording was stopped, the aversive stimuli were turned back on and the animal was allowed 5 min more to enter the escape box. If that also failed, the animal was manually placed in the box. After completion of each trial, the box was placed in the home cage.

Reversal trials
Three days after acquisition trials, the escape box was placed underneath the hole opposite to the hole that had been the target during acquisition training. Reversal training was conducted for seven consecutive days as described above.

Parameters
Each of the 16 escape holes in the Barnes maze was defined as a separate zone-of-interest in the behaviour analysis software. The following parameters were analysed: latency to target [time from start of the trial to first entry into the target hole zone (s)], total distance moved (cm) and error frequency (number of visits to other holes than the target hole). During reversal training two additional parameters were analysed: the mean number of visits to the old target hole over the seven trials (the hole where the escape box was located during acquisition training) and the mean number of visits to the two holes adjacent to the old target hole.

 asphyxiation and within 1 h the brains were dissected out and placed in a 37% formalin solution (Fixatin). The brains were split through corpus callosum, separating the two hemispheres. After systematic random assignment of left or right hemisphere they were coloured on the outer surface to preserve a coded sequence and embedded in paraffin with an automatic vacuum tissue processor (Leica ASP300). The hemispheres were then mounted horizontally balancing on needles and embedded in a paraffin block with up to four hemispheres in one block

Sectioning
The whole hemisphere was cut horizontally with a Leica (model SM 2400) microtome with a microtome setting of 40 μm thickness. All sections were mounted on silicone-coated glass (Frost +). After a minimum of 24 h in a 40°C heating cupboard, the sections were sampled systematic uniformly randomly (SURS). The first section was randomly selected from a random number table, hereafter every 6th section was sampled systematically for staining and counting. This provided a total of 8–10 sections containing the hippocampus per specimen. To be able to account for block advance (BA) the block height was measured for every 100th section. The BA determines the hitting probability of the particles within the block (see later for calculation). Furthermore, the paraffin shrinkage effect was calculated and amounted to about 70%. The sections were stained with a modified Vogt’s Cresyl violet acetate (Armed forces).

). However, since perseveration is also a feature of prefrontal cortical dysfunction and there was no hippocampal dysfunction in the acquisition trials, we can only conclude that the behaviour in reversal trial may be related to hippocampus, but we cannot exclude that it is was caused by, e.g. a prefrontal cortical deficit.

). So apparently the MS mice needed more time to acquire to the spatial search strategy when learning the task, which could indicate a learning disability. However, since the MS mice did not show difficulties in using the spatial search strategy in the reverse trials, no firm conclusions can be made on this point.

). None of these previous studies have quantified the total cell numbers in the hippocampus using stereology in early trauma animal models or in humans. The model can apparently induce a neuron change in the hippocampus but whether the lower neuron number is a decrease due to a neuron loss or because neurogenesis has been affected in the peak period could not be determined in this study. Secondly, the impact of the neuron loss is not immediately linked to a possible memory deficit. Even though the MS animals had a reduced emotional responds in the elevated plus maze and showed perseverance in the Barnes maze, the cognitive deficits could just as well be due to a prefrontal damage and thus not a result of the decreased neuron numbers in DG.
We tested if a 24-h maternal separation on PND 9 can cause an adult phenotype characterized by altered levels of activity and anxiety, learning and memory dysfunction, deficits in behavioural flexibility (reversal deficits) as well as changes in number of neurons in the hippocampus and its subregions in the mouse brain. We found that a single 24 h maternal separation on PND 9 could elicit a reduced stress response in the elevated plus maze and induce perseveration behaviour in the Barnes maze. Further, a 20% reduction in total neuron numbers was found in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus.

Ethics
The experiment was carried out in accordance with the European Communities Council Directive of 24 November 1986 (86/609/EEC) and the Danish legislation regulating animal experiments (Animal care and housing BEK nr 687 from 25/07/2003). The Danish Animal Experiments Inspectorate approved the protocols (Journal No. 2003/561–781).


We are grateful for the help and assistance from our technicians Susanne Sørensen and Hans Jørgen Jensen from Research Laboratory for Stereology and Neuroscience at Bispebjerg Hospital. Further, we wish to thank associated professor Thomas Krohn and animal caretaker Helene Rieman from Laboratory Animal Science and Welfare, KVL (The Royal Veterinary and Agricultural University) for letting KF work at the animal facilities. The financial support from The Lundbeck Foundation is sincerely acknowledged.
