In addition to the debilitating fatigue, the majority of patients with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) experience chronic widespread pain. These pain complaints show the greatest overlap between CFS and fibromyalgia (FM). Although the literature provides evidence for central sensitization as cause for the musculoskeletal pain in FM, in CFS this evidence is currently lacking, despite the observed similarities in both diseases. The knowledge concerning the physiological mechanism of central sensitization, the pathophysiology and the pain processing in FM, and the knowledge on the pathophysiology of CFS lead to the hypothesis that central sensitization is also responsible for the sustaining pain complaints in CFS. This hypothesis is based on the hyperalgesia and allodynia reported in CFS, on the elevated concentrations of nitric oxide presented in the blood of CFS patients, on the typical personality styles seen in CFS and on the brain abnormalities shown on brain images. To examine the present hypothesis more research is required. Further investigations could use similar protocols to those already used in studies on pain in FM like, for example, studies on temporal summation, spatial summation, the role of psychosocial aspects in chronic pain, etc.

Besides the knowledge on chronic pain in FM, it is necessary to gather knowledge on musculoskeletal pain in CFS.

Some authors already found evidence suggesting differences in pain processing. For example, patterns of functional brain activity in patients with FM are quite different from those in patients with CFS.

The goal of this article is to provide a rational basis for future investigations. First, the concept of central sensitisation as a cause of chronic pain will be explained. This theoretical background will then be applied to FM and an overview of the evidence for central sensitization in FM will follow. Finally, based on the theoretical background and the findings in FM, the hypothesis concerning central sensitization in CFS will be unfolded, supported with the present knowledge on CFS.

This study clearly demonstrates that spinal cord neurons are sensitized in chronic pain after whiplash and in patients with FM; because the stimuli were delivered at random time intervals and the latency of EMG response was measured, voluntary symptom amplification could be ruled out. Moreover, the electrical stimulation bypasses peripheral receptors.

Central sensitization in CFS?

Conclusion
Chronic widespread pain can be the consequence of central sensitization. Central sensitization is known as an increased central neuronal responsiveness and causes hyperalgesia, allodynia, and referred pain and hyperalgesia across multiple spinal segments, leading to chronic widespread pain. Possible triggers for sensitization of the spinal cord have extensively been discussed, such as wind-up or temporal summation, dysregulated descending inhibitory pathways, and upregulated facilitatory modulation. Wind-up or temporal summation is the result of repetitive noxious stimuli, leading to an increase in electrical discharges in the dorsal horn. Inhibitory modulation can be impaired by abnormalities in the central nervous system and the facilitatory pain pathways can be stimulated by certain behavioral and cognitive factors.
This theoretical background can be applied to FM. In FM, studies already provided evidence for central sensitization as the cause of chronic pain. Temporal summation was found to be more facilitated, and the inhibitory pain modulation seemed impaired in FM patients. These findings can explain the chronic spontaneous pain in FM. Furthermore, some central abnormalities could be examined/objectified in FM: 1) hyperexcitability of the spinal cord, 2) decreased perfusion of pain-related brain structures, and 3) high levels of substance P in CSF. In addition, FM patients often present with pain hypervigilance, maladaptive coping strategies, and catastrophic thoughts, leading to cognitive central sensitization.
Based on the knowledge on central sensitization, on FM and on CFS, it is suggested that chronic widespread pain in CFS is the consequence of central sensitization. There are arguments and probable mechanisms that could explain this phenomenon in CFS. Also, in other chronic pain populations, central sensitization may play a key role. In fact, there are many similarities between CFS patients and other chronic pain populations such as patients with chronic low-back pain, whiplash, FM, etc. The psychosocial factors, for example, have been proved to contribute to pain perception in these different pain populations. But the specific nature of CFS such as the immunological abnormalities, elevated NO amounts, preceding infections etc., invites further research, in particular, on the possible contributory role of these abnormalities to pain processing in CFS.

] could be used to test the sensitivity of the central nervous system. Clearly, there are many possible research areas to test the hypothesis, but there is still a long way to go to elucidate the nature of the chronic pain in CFS.
