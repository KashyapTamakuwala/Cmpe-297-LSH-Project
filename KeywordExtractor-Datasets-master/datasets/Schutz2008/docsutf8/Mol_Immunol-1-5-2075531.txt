-glycosylated and could bind the lectin jacalin. Staphylococcal protein A displayed weak binding for the equine IgGs in the order: IgG1 > IgG3 > IgG4 > IgG7 > IgG2 = IgG5 > IgG6. Streptococcal protein G bound strongly to IgG1, IgG4 and IgG7, moderately to IgG3, weakly to IgG2 and IgG6, and not at all to IgG5. Analysis of antibody effector functions revealed that IgG1, IgG3, IgG4, IgG5 and IgG7, but not IgG2 and IgG6, were able to elicit a strong respiratory burst from equine peripheral blood leukocytes, predicting that the former five IgG subclasses are able to interact with Fc receptors on effector cells. IgG1, IgG3, IgG4 and IgG7, but not IgG2, IgG5 and IgG6, were able to bind complement C1q and activate complement via the classical pathway. The differential effector function capabilities of the subclasses suggest that, for maximum efficacy, equine vaccine strategies should seek to elicit antibody responses of the IgG1, IgG3, IgG4, and IgG7 subclasses.

Although a role for equine IgG antibodies in protection against disease has long been recognised, the structures and functions of the individual IgG subclasses are not well characterised. Identification and cloning of the full complement of IgG H chain genes has provided a fresh resource for the study of equine IgG proteins. Here, we describe the first expression of recombinant versions of all seven equine IgG subclasses and present an analysis of their individual physical and biological properties.

2.4
Reactivity of commercially available anti-horse IgG antibodies with the reqIgGs
The following antibodies were tested for reactivity against the reqIgGs in ELISA: goat HRP-conjugated polyclonal antibodies specific for horse IgGa, IgGb, IgGc or IgG(T), (kindly provided by Serotec, Oxford, UK and Bethyl Laboratories, Montgomery, TX, USA), and mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAb) against horse IgGa (CVS48), IgGb (CVS39), IgGc (CVS53) and IgG(T) (CVS38) (kindly provided by Serotec). Secondary antibody used to detect binding of the mAb was a goat anti-mouse IgG1-HRP conjugate diluted 1/10,000 (kindly provided by Serotec). In addition, HRP-conjugated goat polyclonal anti-horse IgG H + L chain (kindly provided by Bethyl Laboratories) and goat anti-horse IgG Fc (Rockland) were tested in ELISA. Antigen-capture ELISAs were performed as above using 250 ng/ml of each purified reqIgG subclass. Detection antibodies were diluted 1/10,000 (goat polyclonals) or 1/100 (anti-IgGa mAb), 1/200 (anti-IgGb mAb), 1/10 (anti-IgGc mAb) and 1/500 (anti-IgG(T) mAb). The goat polyclonal anti-horse IgGa, IgGb, IgGc and IgG(T) antibodies were also tested in immunoblotting. Purified reqIgGs (1 μg) were electrophoresed under reducing and non-reducing conditions and the detection antibodies were diluted as for ELISA.

2.6
Interaction with staphylococcal protein A and streptococcal protein G
Interaction of reqIgGs with protein A and protein G was analysed by ELISA. NIP-BSA coated wells were incubated with 100 μl (0.25 μg/ml) of one of the purified reqIgGs or recombinant human IgG1 for comparison. Binding to protein A or protein G was detected by incubation with 100 μl of serial dilutions of either HRP-conjugated protein A (0–50 μg/ml in PBS-T) or HRP-conjugated protein G (0–5 μg/ml in PBS-T) (both Sigma, Poole, UK). Plates were developed with ABTS and absorbance read at 405 nm.

After washing, plates were incubated with either a 1/800 dilution of sheep anti-C1q-HRP (Serotec) or a 1/500 dilution of biotin-conjugated anti-C5b-9 (Quidel, Santa Clara, CA, USA), followed by streptavidin-HRP (Dako) diluted 1/1000 in PBS-T, 0.5% BSA for 1 h at room temperature.

Results
3.1
Analysis of purified antibody by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting
Transfection of each of the equine γ1–γ7 H chain expression vectors into CHO cells stably expressing a compatible mouse λ light (L) chain allowed expression of all seven subclasses. Expressed Ig was purified by antigen affinity chromatography followed by FPLC. All seven IgGs eluted from FPLC as a single major peak representing monomer. Minor peaks eluting earlier were attributed to antibody that had aggregated during purification. For each subclass, fractions corresponding to the major peak were pooled and used for all subsequent experiments.

), suggesting that a small proportion of the IgG4 and IgG7 molecules lack inter-H and/or H–L disulphide bonds and are stabilized by non-covalent interactions alone. Hence, under the native conditions of FPLC only a single major peak of fully assembled IgG was seen.

3.2
Reactivity of anti-horse IgG antibodies with the reqIgG subclasses
Table 1
. The polyclonal antibody directed against horse IgGa was specific for a single subclass, namely IgG1. Similarly a polyclonal antibody preparation directed against IgGc was found to recognise just one subclass, in this case IgG6. Goat anti-horse IgGb showed strong reactivity with IgG4 and IgG7 but also weakly recognised IgG1. The goat anti-horse IgG(T) polyclonal antibody reacted most strongly with IgG5, but also recognised IgG2 and IgG3. The pattern of recognition of the IgG subclasses by the mAbs was similar to that of the polyclonal antibodies except that anti-horse IgGb mAb recognised IgG4 and IgG7 but not IgG1, and anti-horse IgG(T) mAb strongly recognised IgG5, weakly recognised IgG3 but showed no reactivity with IgG2. Reactivity of both the polyclonal and monoclonal anti-IgGb antibodies with IgG4 and IgG7 is not surprising as these two subclasses show 97% amino acid identity.

), both of which carry identical light chains to those of the eqIgGs (data not shown). Anti-horse IgG Fc gave strong ELISA signals with IgG1, IgG4 and IgG7, intermediate signals with IgG3 and IgG5, and only weak signals with IgG2 and IgG6.

Fig. 2
Sheoran et al., 1998
). Under reducing conditions, goat anti-horse IgG(T) used at a 1/10,000 dilution recognised IgG3 and 5 but in contrast to non-reducing SDS-PAGE and ELISA no longer reacted with IgG2 but with IgG1 instead. However, recognition of IgG2 under reducing conditions could be achieved with a higher concentration (1/1000 dilution) of detection antibody (data not shown).

 also showed that the binding affinity of IgGb (IgG4 and IgG7) to protein G was higher than that of IgGa (IgG1). Furthermore, they identified two fractions of IgG(T), one which bound strongly to protein G and one that bound weakly, which most likely correspond to IgG3 and IgG5, respectively.

IgG3 was the most potent activator of complement, followed by IgG1, IgG4 and IgG7, which all bound C1q and activated complement to the same extent. Recombinant IgG2, IgG5 and IgG6 did not bind C1q or activate complement.

 molecules, the corresponding core hinge sequence is CPKC. In contrast, the core hinge sequences of eqIgG7 and IgG4 are CPTC and CPAEC respectively, suggesting that deviations from central Lys to either Thr or Ala-Glu may decrease the efficiency of interchain disulphide bridge formation in some way.

). The fact that the highest level of binding is seen with eqIgG1, IgG4 and IgG7, which like human IgG1 all possess His433 and Tyr436, may suggest that these two residues play key discriminatory roles in the binding of horse IgGs to protein G.

). Thus, amino acid differences in this region may account, at least in part, for the observed differences in ability to trigger a respiratory burst. However, despite IgG4, IgG5 and IgG7 lacking the full motif, these subclasses are still capable of eliciting strong respiratory bursts, suggesting that regions other than the lower hinge region may influence interaction with at least some classes of equine FcγRs.
Burton and Woof, 1992
Klinman et al., 1966
) using guinea pig complement showed that a preparation comprising IgGa and IgGb (i.e., IgG1, IgG4 and IgG7) was able to fix complement whilst IgGc (i.e., IgG6) was not. The current study confirmed and extended these results. We found that eqIgG3 was the most potent activator of complement, followed by eqIgG1, IgG4 and IgG7, while eqIgG2, IgG5 and IgG6 failed to bind C1q or activate complement. While our results were obtained using human serum as a source of complement, and we cannot rule out the possibility of subtle differences of reactivity with horse complement, we feel that our findings provide a good reflection of the likely relative complement-activating capabilities of the different eqIgG subclasses.
Duncan and Winter, 1988; Idusogie et al., 2000; Thomessen et al., 2000
Fig. 8
). However, all of the complement-activating subclasses have a Lys corresponding to Lys322. The fact that this residue is a serine in eqIgG2 and IgG5 may account, at least in part, for the inability of these subclasses to activate complement. Curiously, IgG6, which possesses a lysine at position 322, does not activate complement, underlining the subtle species differences that are apparent in complement activation.
Our data on the effector function capabilities of the IgG subclasses have important new implications for the design of effective horse vaccines. It is clear that to achieve maximal protection via FcγR- and complement-mediated elimination mechanisms, vaccines should seek to elicit IgG antibodies of the IgG1, IgG3, IgG4 and IgG7 subclasses. Vaccines that trigger only IgG2, IgG5 or IgG6 antibodies are predicted to offer less effective protection. Since IgG plays key roles in both serum and mucosal compartments in the horse, these considerations are applicable to both systemic and mucosal vaccination strategies.

). The reqIgGs described here are a reliable source of pure and homogeneous equine IgG subclasses and will serve as useful reference proteins for the production and screening of equine specific reagents. In particular, the generation of mAb able to discriminate between the seven subclasses is an ongoing project. Moreover, they will provide a valuable resource for future research, in particular in delineation of the function of individual IgG subclasses in antibody-mediated immunity of the horse.

Fig. 1
SDS-PAGE analysis of purified reqIgGs. ReqIgGs were analysed by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie under (A) non-reducing conditions and (B) reducing conditions. (C) Immunoblot analysis under non-reducing conditions probed with rabbit anti-mouse λ L chain cross out (C). sIgG, horse serum IgG; huIgG, recombinant human IgG1 containing mouse λ L chains. On each gel, an equivalent quantity of each reqIgG subclass was loaded (5 μg for Coomassie stained gels and 1 μg for immunoblots). The “doublet” bands apparent in some subclasses under non-reducing conditions probably reflect heterogeneity in glycosylation.



Fig. 2
Reactivity of polyclonal anti-horse IgG subclass antibodies with reqIgGs in immunoblotting under (A) non-reducing conditions and (B) reducing conditions. Numbers at the top refer to the subclass loaded in that lane. The anti-IgG subclass antibody used is indicated below each image. On each gel, an equivalent quantity of each reqIgG subclass (1 μg) was loaded.



Fig. 3
Reactivity of reqIgGs with Con A (A) and jacalin (B). huIgG1, recombinant human IgG1; huIgA1, recombinant human IgA1. On each gel, an equivalent quantity of each reqIgG subclass (1 μg) was loaded.

-glycanase. IgG1 was probed with anti-horse IgGa; IgG2, IgG3 and IgG5 with anti-horse IgG(T); IgG4 and IgG7 with anti-horse IgGb; and IgG6 with anti-horse IgGc. On each gel, an equivalent quantity of each reqIgG subclass (1 μg) was loaded.



Fig. 5
ELISA analysis of protein A (A) and protein G (B) binding to equivalent quantities of the reqIgG subclasses. The means of three experiments are shown. Standard error was <5% between experiments. huIgG1, recombinant human IgG1.



Fig. 6
Stimulation of respiratory burst in equine PBL by equivalent quantities of the reqIgG subclasses. Each point is the mean of triplicate determinations. The experiment was performed three times with PBL from different donors. The results shown are those from a typical experiment. RLU, relative light index.



Fig. 7
C1q binding (A) and C5-9 deposition (B) by antigen-captured reqIgG as detected by ELISA. huIgG3, recombinant human IgG3. The figure shows the mean of three experiments.



Fig. 8
Amino acid sequence alignment of the Fc region of eqIgGs. The sequence of human IgG1 Fc is shown for comparison. Human IgG1 residues implicated in interactions are indicated as follows: protein A, bold, italic; protein G, bold, non-italic; both protein A and protein G, box; FcγR, grey highlight; C1q, underline.
