Surgical articular cartilage repair therapies for cartilage defects such as osteochondral autograft transfer, autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) or matrix associated autologous chondrocyte transplantation (MACT) are becoming more common. MRI has become the method of choice for non-invasive follow-up of patients after cartilage repair surgery. It should be performed with cartilage sensitive sequences, including fat-suppressed proton density-weighted T2 fast spin-echo (PD/T2-FSE) and three-dimensional gradient-echo (3D GRE) sequences, which provide good signal-to-noise and contrast-to-noise ratios. A thorough magnetic resonance (MR)-based assessment of cartilage repair tissue includes evaluations of defect filling, the surface and structure of repair tissue, the signal intensity of repair tissue and the subchondral bone status. Furthermore, in osteochondral autografts surface congruity, osseous incorporation and the donor site should be assessed. High spatial resolution is mandatory and can be achieved either by using a surface coil with a 1.5-T scanner or with a knee coil at 3 T; it is particularly important for assessing graft morphology and integration. Moreover, MR imaging facilitates assessment of complications including periosteal hypertrophy, delamination, adhesions, surface incongruence and reactive changes such as effusions and synovitis. Ongoing developments include isotropic 3D sequences, for improved morphological analysis, and in vivo biochemical imaging such as dGEMRIC, T2 mapping and diffusion-weighted imaging, which make functional analysis of cartilage possible.

By contrast, through the use of appropriate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques it is possible to evaluate the biochemical and biomechanical status of cartilage in addition to cartilage morphology. These benefits make MRI a powerful tool for the initial diagnosis and subsequent post-operative monitoring of cartilage lesions and cartilage repair tissue.

Quantitative MRI of articular cartilage
45
46
]. Three-dimensional reconstructions can be generated from pre- and post-operative MR examinations and spatially registered to facilitate longitudinal comparisons of the cartilage repair site. This area holds a lot of promise for cartilage repair surgery planning; with on-going work to co-register biochemical and biomechanical sequences, such as dGEMRIC, with high-resolution 3D sequences.

High-resolution MRI
Most MRI studies on articular cartilage have tried to optimise pulse sequences that accentuate the contrast-to-noise ratio for cartilage, but less attention has been paid to image resolution.
47
27
31
33
]. Therefore, MRI of cartilage repair tissue must be performed at a sufficiently high resolution to detect early surface changes.
In order to obtain a sufficient resolution for cartilage repair imaging a 1.5-T MR scanner with a high performance gradient system and a dedicated extremity coil (quadrature/phased array coil) is a minimum requirement. Three-Tesla clinical MR systems are becoming more widespread and can generate images with both a high signal-to-noise ratio and a high resolution.

 acquired in a clinically acceptable time. However, the use of a surface coil is limited to the evaluation of one knee compartment; since cartilage repair is usually restricted to one compartment, this rarely poses a problem.

]. However, in vivo studies of the dGEMRIC index in ACI grafted tissue are not so clearly correlated with stiffness of the repair tissue. The differences are presumably due to differences in the collagen content and architecture of the repair tissue. Therefore, the both GAG (dGEMRIC) and collagen (T2 mapping) imaging techniques are required when evaluating the biomechanical status of cartilage repair tissue.

] used four parameters to assess cartilage repair on MR images: surface integrity and contour, cartilage signal in graft region, cartilage thickness and changes in underlying bone. A score is obtained by summing the values of the four parameters; scores range from 0, no repair, to a maximum of 4, complete repair. Unfortunately the system only assesses each parameter as normal or abnormal and provides no assessment of the graft integration, degree of defect fill or the presence of adhesions.

An MRI evaluation of osteochondral grafts should include: the number and size of the grafts; bone and cartilage integration, the cartilage surface contour; the contour of the cartilage bone interface; an assessment of the signal in the graft, the adjacent bone marrow and at the donor site; details of any soft tissue abnormalities and an assessment of the contrast enhancement patterns.

They showed that the grafts were well seated and the cartilage-cartilage interface demonstrated a smooth contour in the majority of cases. Moreover, the authors felt that indirect MR arthrography was superior to unenhanced imaging in the assessment of the cartilage surface. Their results highlight a potential role for indirect MR arthrography in challenging cases.

Normal findings
The results of these earlier follow-up studies have helped to define normal and abnormal MR findings following osteochondral autografting and help in the identification of possible complications.
“Normal” MR findings associated with after osteochondral autografting include bone marrow oedema in and around the grafts in approximately 50% of the subjects during the first 12 months, with a gradual reduction thereafter. However persistent oedema may be seen in a small number of cases for up to 3 years post-operatively. Joint effusion and synovitis appear to follow a similar trend. Incongruities at the bone-bone interface occur frequently, while incongruities at the cartilage-cartilage interface occur in approximately 15% of grafts. The sometimes substantial incongruities of the bone-bone interface should not be interpreted as an abnormal finding or complication. Differences occur because the cartilage thickness of the donor site commonly differs in thickness from the implant site, but the cylinder is inserted to a depth to ensure a smooth cartilage surface.

Future studies in this field should provide better understanding of the pathophysiology of transplanted hyaline cartilage and its function, which is important for the long-term prognosis of these patients.


MR findings following ACI and MACT
Assessment and interpretation of MR examinations for ACI and MACT patients should be performed in a systematic fashion. Careful attention should be paid to the degree of defect filling, the integration of the graft to adjacent cartilage and underlying bone, the graft’s internal structure and surface, its signal intensity and any changes in the subchondral bone. Last but not least, the presence of adhesions to the graft or joint effusion should be evaluated.

] studied 41 patients at 1 year following ACI grafting on the femoral condyle. The histological appearance of the graft was classified into one of the four morphological categories recommended by the ICRS. MRI findings were correlated to the histology findings. The authors found no relationship between any of the MRI features assessed and the histological appearance of the cartilage repair tissue; however, this is unsurprising given the sequences used. Studies of the correlation between histology and the dGEMRIC index and/or T2 maps are a very interesting area for future studies.

Functional outcome
58
] recently described the statistical correlation of clinical outcome scores with the radiological variables of the MOCART scoring system. For the variable “filling of the defect” a statistically significant correlation with all KOOS (knee injury and osteoarthritis outcome score) variables and also with the VAS (visual analogue score) was observed. For the variable “integration to border zone” and “surface of the repair tissue” no statistically significant correlation was found. The variable “structure of the repair tissue” showed a statistically significant correlation with the VAS and nearly all KOOS group except for the variable “symptoms”. For the variables “adhesion”, “subchondral lamina”, and “effusion” no statistically significant correlation with the clinical scores was found. In contrast the variable “subchondral bone” showed a statistically significant correlation with the VAS and nearly all KOOS group except for the variable “symptoms”. For the signal intensities a statistically significant correlation was found with the KOOS variables “symptoms”, “sport”, and Activities of daily Living (ADL) function.



Recommendations
From reviewing our studies and those of other centres we recommend that follow-up MR studies should be performed at 3 months and 1 year. The initial imaging at 3 months allows the volume and adherence of repair tissue to be assessed. Imaging at 1 year demonstrates the maturation of the graft and allows complications to be identified both non-invasively and at a sufficiently early stage.
