Introduction
2001
). As a consequence, lifestyle-related diseases, such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus, will be of increasing concern in this patient group. Therefore, more attention towards a healthy lifestyle is warranted. Similar to the general population, persons with MMC develop their own lifestyle during the transition from adolescence to adulthood. At this age, special attention should be paid to optimize the lifestyle in order to improve health throughout life.

); previously we reported that 35% of adolescents and young adults with MMC were obese (Buffart et al. in press). Because these previous studies lack simultaneous assessment of several health-related physical fitness components, the relation between aerobic capacity and other components remains unclear. Insight in these inter-relations may show for example, whether focusing on peripheral factors such as muscle strength would have additional value for improving aerobic capacity.

). Therefore, also in persons with MMC, we expected aerobic capacity to be related to muscle strength.

Method
Participants
Recruitment
Adolescents and young adults with MMC, aged between 16 and 30 years, were recruited from the university hospitals in Rotterdam, Leiden, Utrecht and Amsterdam and all rehabilitation centers in the Southwest of the Netherlands. Exclusion criteria were complete dependence on an electric wheelchair, presence of disorders other than MMC that affect daily physical activity (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis), and presence of disorders that contra-indicate a maximal exercise test (e.g. exercise-induced ischemia or arrhythmias, uncontrolled hypertension and exercise limitation due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). We invited 171 persons of whom 50 participated in the study (29%). Main reasons for non-participation were no interest, lack of time or duration of the measurements. No differences were found between participants and non-participants regarding age, gender, level of lesion and presence of hydrocephalus, as measured with an independent t-test or Chi square test (Buffart et al. in press). All participants and parents of adolescents aged less than 18 years gave written informed consent before participating in the study. The Medical Ethics Committee of the Erasmus MC Rotterdam and of all participating institutes approved the study.

Flexibility
As indicator of flexibility of lower extremity we assessed passive mobility of hip and knee joint while participants were lying supine and of the ankle joint while they were sitting. We considered mobility to be restricted when extension of hip and knee joint and ankle dorsal flexion did not reach neutral position. Since no differences were found in mobility restrictions between dominant and non-dominant side (tested with the Wilcoxon signed rank test) we used the results of the dominant side to calculate a sum score of joint mobility ranging from 0 (no mobility restrictions in any joint) to 3 (all three joints have mobility restrictions).

Discussion
Components of health-related physical fitness
In the present study, several health-related components of physical fitness were studied simultaneously in a relatively large group of adolescents and young adults with MMC. In general, most participants had poor health-related physical fitness.

). Because causality cannot be established with the cross-sectional design of the present study, future studies should confirm whether strength training results in increased aerobic capacity in persons with MMC. However, considering the small, but significant, contribution of muscle strength to the explained variance, we assume this specific effect to be small. In this respect, it seems that mainly aerobic training is needed in order to improve aerobic capacity; however, including strength training may have additional value.

). Despite, a selection bias may have occurred since it could be that the more active and more fit people had higher interest in participating than the less active and less fit ones, which may have led to an overestimation of health-related physical fitness components.
