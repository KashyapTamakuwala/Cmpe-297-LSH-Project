). The sensory ataxia progressed and she got tetraparesis, most severe proximally in her arms, especially myotome C4. Although hemangioblastoma are not very radiosensitive, radiotherapy was started because of the rapid clinical deterioration. High-dose total neuraxis radiotherapy was considered to toxic. It was judged that most of her clinical complaints could be attributed to the cervical spine. Also the MRI showed the most severe lesions at the cervical region. Therefore she was treated from C1 to Th1 (30 × 1.8 Gy) combined with dexamethasone (2 × 8 mg). During radiotherapy she developed also symptoms outside the radiotherapy field (thoracal radiculopathy).
