HSP70
 inhibited FIR-induced growth arrest in HSC3 cells, and an HSP70 siRNA inhibited the proliferation of A431 cells by irradiation with FIR. These results indicate that the effect of a body temperature range of FIR suppressing the proliferation of some cancer cells is controlled by the basal expression level of heat shock protein (HSP) 70A. This finding suggested that FIR should be very effective medical treatment for some cancer cells which have a low level of HSP70. Still more, if the level of HSP70 in any cancer of a patient was measured, the effect of medical treatment by FIR can be foreseen for the cancer.

BrdU incorporation was quantified by measuring the absorbance of the substrate reaction (405 nm) and the absorbance at the reference wavelength (590 nm) using an ImmunoMini NJ-2300 (System Instruments, Tokyo, Japan). Absorbance values directly correlated with the amount of DNA synthesis and therefore the number of proliferating cells.

After 4 days of FIR irradiation, the cells were observed with a CK40 phase contrast microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan), fixed, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. For immunofluorescent staining of heat shock protein (HSP) 70, cells were washed in Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS), fixed for 20 min in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, washed three times for 5 min each in PBS, and blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 5% goat serum. Cells were incubated at 4°C overnight in 1:200 mouse monoclonal antibody to HSP70 (Stressgen, Victoria, Canada) in PBS containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. After washing, the cells were incubated with 1:400 FITC (Fluorescein isothiocyanate)-labeled goat anti mouse IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA). The localization of intracellular HSP70 protein was identified using a BX51 confocal microscope (Olympus) and a Cool SNAP CF digital camera (Roper Scientific, Trenton, NJ, USA) and calibrated using RS Image Express software (Roper Scientific).

Separated proteins were then transferred from the gel to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. After blocking with 5% skim milk in PBS-Tween, the membrane was incubated for 1 h at room temperature with primary antibody in PBS-T containing 5% skim milk, followed by three 10-min washes with PBS-T. Next, the membranes were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody and washed three times for 10 min with PBS-T. Immunoreactive protein was detected using an ECL plus kit (Amersham Biosciences) and visualization by exposure to Hyperfilm (Amersham Biosciences). The primary antibodies used were rabbit anti-HSP70 (Stressgen), anti α-actin (Sigma), and the secondary antibody was horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse (Zymed Laboratories, South San Francisco, CA, USA) or anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Biosciences).

Discussion
In the present studies, we showed that FIR suppresses the proliferation of HSC3, Sa3, and A549 cell lines. Two other cell lines, A431 and MCF7, showed almost no growth arrest in response to FIR. The effect of FIR does not seem to be related to the cell type or source, because these three cell lines have different origins: HSC3 is from a tongue squamous cell carcinoma, Sa3 is from a gingival squamous cell carcinoma, and A549 is from a pulmonary adenocarcinoma. FIR was found to cause hypertrophy without apoptosis in all three sensitive cell lines, although there was a slight increase in necrosis in the Sa3 cells by histological observation. In addition, the expression of apoptosis-related genes was unchanged in the FIR-sensitive cells by microarray analysis. Overall, FIR seemed to cause changes in the cytoskeleton, suppress proliferation, and induce some necrosis without apoptosis. These results raise the question of why proliferation of A431 and MCF7 was not suppressed by FIR. Perhaps something in certain cancer cell lines is present for resistance to FIR. We then focused on genes encoding the HSPs, which are well known to participate in the cellular resistance to stress. We found that HSP70 showed the highest correlation with the growth rate of cancer cells affected by FIR in 35 HSP genes on the microarray system.

 inhibited FIR-induced growth arrest in HSC3 cells and an HSP70 siRNA inhibited the proliferation of A431 cells by FIR.

]. However, in the present study, HSP70 was never induced by FIR. These results suggested that FIR has anti-tumor activity without inducing HSP70 as an anti-stress factor. This characteristic indicates that FIR may be suitable for medical treatment.

]. This finding was consistent with our results for FIR and the suggestion of HSP70 as the acting mechanism. However, FIR may be regarded as a sub-lethal stress that avoids an anti-stress reaction in some cancer cells.
23
]. This finding suggests that the effect of FIR may be a sub-lethal stress for cancer cells protected by HSP70 as an anti-stress protein. In other words, FIR may be a very effective medical treatment for some cancer cell lines that have a low level of HSP70. Furthermore, if the level of HSP70 in any cancer of a patient is measured, the effect of medical treatment by FIR on the cancer may be predicted.

Conclusion
It was found here for the first time the effect on body temperature range by FIR in several cancer cell lines in vitro, which is controlled by endogenous HSP70 to protect cells from FIR-induced growth arrest. This finding suggests that FIR may be a very effective medical treatment for some cancer cell lines that have a low level of HSP70. Furthermore, if the level of HSP70 in any cancer of a patient is measured, the effect of medical treatment by FIR on the cancer may be predicted.
