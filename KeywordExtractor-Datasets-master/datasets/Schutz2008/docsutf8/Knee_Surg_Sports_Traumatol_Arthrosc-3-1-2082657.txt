The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) consists of an anteromedial bundle (AMB) and a posterolateral bundle (PLB). A reconstruction restoring the functional two-bundled nature should be able to approximate normal ACL function better than the most commonly used single-bundle reconstructions. Accurate tunnel positioning is important, but difficult. The purpose of this study was to provide a geometric description of the centre of the attachments relative to arthroscopically visible landmarks. The AMB and PLB attachment sites in 35 dissected cadaver knees were measured with a 3D system, as were anatomical landmarks of femur and tibia. At the femur, the mean ACL centre is positioned 7.9 ± 1.4 mm (mean ± 1 SD) shallow, along the notch roof, from the most lateral over-the-top position at the posterior edge of the intercondylar notch and from that point 4.0 ± 1.3 mm from the notch roof, low on the surface of the lateral condyle wall. The mean AMB centre is at 7.2 ± 1.8 and 1.4 ± 1.7 mm, and the mean PLB centre at 8.8 ± 1.6 and 6.7 ± 2.0 mm. At the tibia, the mean ACL centre is positioned 5.1 ± 1.7 mm lateral of the medial tibial spine and from that point 9.8 ± 2.1 mm anterior. The mean AMB centre is at 3.0 ± 1.6 and 9.4 ± 2.2 mm, and the mean PLB centre at 7.2 ± 1.8 and 10.1 ± 2.1 mm. The ACL attachment geometry is well defined relative to arthroscopically visible landmarks with respect to the AMB and PLB. With simple guidelines for the surgeon, the attachments centres can be found during arthroscopic single-bundle or double-bundle reconstructions.

]. Due to the two-dimensional and limited view on the arthroscopic monitor, the landmarks and descriptions used in the above-mentioned studies seem not sufficient for correct positioning of the two separate bundles in all planes during arthroscopic surgery.
This study is aimed at acquiring quantitative geometric data of the ACL attachments on tibia and femur, such that these data can be used in an arthroscopically guided procedure for reconstruction of the ACL. We hypothesized that reliable guidelines to find the centres of the AMB, PLB and ACL relative to arthroscopically visible landmarks can be established. For the purpose of an anatomically accurate reconstruction of the ACL, the variations should be equal to or less than reported in other studies. As regard to the dimensions of drilled tunnel holes, normally 10 up to 12 mm, 95% (mean ± 2SD) of the attachment centres should be within this range. Therefore the a priori set assumption is that the maximally acceptable SD is 2.5 up to 3 mm.

]. In 90° of flexion, an anterior load was manually applied. This caused tension in the fibres of the medial tibial attachment site, the AMB. The fibres of the PLB remained slack. This procedure enabled a separation of the two bundles at the tibial attachment from ventral. The femur was turned in the clamp to enable a posterior approach and the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) was removed. In this position the initial division of the ACL at the tibial attachment was visible and used to extend the division towards the femoral origin. The tibia was moved towards extension. The PLB-fibres, inserting at the lateral femoral ACL attachment site, tightened, enabling to complete the separation as far as the femoral attachment. The outline contours of both AMB and PLB attachment areas were marked, with a waterproof felt pen.

]. On the femur and tibia, the attachment sites of the AMB, PLB and the entire ACL were digitized by means of a collection of points placed at equal distances on the marked outlines. The 3D position of the centres of the ACL, AMB and PLB attachments were calculated by the geometric mean of all points on the outlines. The 3D distances between the centres of the two bundles were calculated. On both femur and tibia, an arthroscopically visible landmark was digitized that served as the origin of a local coordinate system. The absolute two-dimensional (2D) positions of the centres relative to these landmarks were calculated. The position in the third dimension was determined by the surface geometry of the femoral condyle and the intercondylar tibial area, respectively.

Results
Femur
The oval-shaped attachment of the anterior cruciate ligament was situated on the medial surface of the lateral femoral condyle. It was positioned deep in the notch, covering most of the proximal half of the wall. The fibres of the deep low border attached to the edge of the joint cartilage, following the contour of this edge posteriorly on the condyle. In only 4 of the 35 specimens, the attachment site was completely limited to the medial wall of the lateral condyle and had no footprint in the notch roof. In 31 femurs, a small part of the deep high AMB attachment extended into the intercondylar notch roof.

Tibia
The tibial attachment area of the ACL was situated between the medial and lateral tibial condyle covering the medial part of the anterior intercondylar area. It was stretched out from the region between the tibial spines to anterior with various extensions, more or less shaped as a footprint. The fibres of the AMB inserted medially along the cartilage edge of the articular surface of the medial tibial condyle. The PLB covered the lateral side of the attachment area and was bounded by the attachment of the anterior horn of the lateral meniscus.

There was a large variation in knee sizes and dimensions of the reference lines. However, we did not find a correlation between the absolute distance of the attachment centres and the size of the reference lines, i.e. knee size. The absolute positions of the attachment centres were more or less similar for large and small knees. Therefore both absolute as well as relative data can be used as guidelines to find the anatomical positions. At the arthroscopic view, the absolute positions are more useful than the relative positions.

Conclusions
This study was performed because no earlier study described the ACL, AMB and PLB attachment centres relative to arthroscopically visible landmarks. This resulted in quantitative data of the positions of the attachment centres of the ACL and its two bundles, relative to bony landmarks on femur and tibia, visible through an arthroscope. Using these results, the surgeon will be able to determine the anatomical position of the ACL and the two functional bundles during arthroscopy without additional images or fluoroscopic support. The results can be applied for anatomic single-bundle or anatomic double-bundle techniques.
