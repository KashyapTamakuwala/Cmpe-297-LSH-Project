]. In the present paper, we compare changes in sexuality and body image in patients with symptomatic uterine fibroids who were randomly assigned to either UAE or hysterectomy.

Materials and Methods
Study Design
15
]. The EMMY trial (EMbolization versus hysterectoMY) is a prospective randomized multicenter clinical trial with 28 participating hospitals in the Netherlands. Eligible patients met the following inclusion criteria: they were clinically diagnosed with uterine fibroids (confirmed by ultrasonography), had menorrhagia as the major complaint, were premenopausal, and had no wish to conceive. All patients were candidates for undergoing a hysterectomy: other treatment options either had failed, were undesired, or had provided unsatisfactory results.
Eligible patients were informed verbally and in writing about possible risks and benefits of both procedures, and were invited to participate in the trial. After written informed consent had been obtained, patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to UAE or hysterectomy by computerized randomization, stratified for hospital. The study was approved by the Dutch Central Committee Involving Human Subjects (www.ccmo.nl) and the local ethics committees of all participating hospitals.

-
assessment
All patients were assessed by the attending gynaecologist. Current symptoms and a complete medical and gynaecological history were recorded. All patients underwent a pelvic ultrasound to determine the number of fibroids and the size of the largest fibroid. Sociodemographic characteristics were assessed by means of a questionnaire.

Procedures
Uterine artery embolization
UAE was performed by an interventional radiologist. A catheter was introduced into the femoral artery and advanced over the aortic bifurcation to the contralateral internal iliac artery, and digital subtraction angiography was performed to identify the origin of the uterine artery. When catheters were placed correctly, the UAE was carried out. Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) particles of 355–500 μm were used in all procedures. UAE patients were advised to refrain from sexual intercourse for at least 2 weeks and thereafter, depending on their complaints.

Hysterectomy
The type of hysterectomy and the route of access were determined by the gynecologist. The following procedures were allowed: abdominal hysterectomy, vaginal hysterectomy, laparoscopically assisted vaginal hysterectomy, and laparoscopic hysterectomy. Both supravaginal and total hysterectomies were allowed. After discharge hysterectomy patients were advised not to have sex until the first outpatient visit at 6 weeks.


Questionnaires
Sexual functioning and body image were assessed by means of patient questionnaires. At baseline, questionnaires were completed by all patients before randomization. Follow-up questionnaires were completed at 6 weeks and 6, 12, 18, and 24 months after treatment. The questionnaire consisted of the Sexual Activity Questionnaire (SAQ), the Body Image Scale (BIS), and the Mental Component Summary (MCS; as part of the Medical Outcome Study Short Form [MOS SF-36]).

SAQ


 Dimension pleasure

  1. Was having sex an important part of your life in the last month?

  2. Did you enjoy sexual activity in the last month?

  3. Did you desire to have sex with your partner in the last month?

  4. In general were you satisfied after sexual activity in the last month?

  5. How often did you engage in sexual activity in the last month?

  6. Were you satisfied with the frequency of sex in the last month?

 Dimension discomfort

  1. Did you notice dryness of your vagina in the last month?

  2. Did you feel pain or discomfort in the last month?

 Dimension habit

  1. How did the frequency of sexual behavior in the last month compare with what is usual for you?

BIS


 In the last month

  1. Have you been feeling self-conscious about your appearance?

 Have you felt less physically attractive as a result of your menstrual bleeding problem?


  3. Have you been dissatisfied with your appearance when dressed?

 Have you been feeling less feminine as a result of your menstrual bleeding problem?


  5. Did you find it difficult to look at yourself naked?

 Have you been feeling less sexually attractive as a result of your menstrual bleeding problem?


  7. Did you avoid people because of the way you felt about your appearance?

  8. Have you been feeling the treatment has left your body less whole?

  9. Have you felt dissatisfied with your body?

  10. Have you been dissatisfied with the appearance of your scar? 



Questions on the BIS shown in italics have been omitted



Furthermore, participating patients were asked to judge their current sexual life in two questions: “How would you describe the quality of your current sexual life?” and “How well can you live with your current sexual life?” One of the following responses could be ticked: “very good,” “good,” “moderately good,” “neither good nor bad,” “moderately bad,” “bad,” and “very bad.”

 displays the questions of which the BIS consists. Unfortunately, questions 2, 4, and 6 were not represented correctly in the questionnaire due to a translation error. Therefore we decided to omit these questions in order to attain a comparable outcome between groups. The BIS score ranges from 0 to 30. A higher BIS score indicates a worse body image.

Sample Size and Endpoints of the Present Study

]: the elimination of menorrhagia in such way that hysterectomy could be avoided in the UAE group in at least 75% of patients within 2 years after the primary interventions.
The objective of the present study was to compare the following endpoints between both interventions: the number of sexually active patients, the scores yielded by the SAQ and the BIS, the subjective quality of sexual life. For this analysis, no separate power calculation was made.

Statistical Analysis
Data entry was performed using SPSS data entry for Windows 3.0. A random sample of 10% of the questionnaires was visually double checked by an independent second investigator, revealing a false entry level of 0.3%. All false data entries were corrected.

]. For the BIS no missing values were allowed since three questions were omitted already. In these cases, the entire score was omitted. For the three omitted questions, the individual mean score of the remaining seven questions was imputed.

 test.
The two added questions on the quality of current sexual life were compared between the groups using the chi-square test (or Fishers’ exact test when appropriate). Furthermore, the quality of sex life and the additional questions at the various follow-up moments were compared to baseline, yielding two different options: “worse,” “the same,” or “better” compared to baseline. Differences between the groups were compared with the chi-square test (or Fishers’ exact test when appropriate).
p
 values <0.1 in the univariate analysis were selected for multivariate analysis.
p

Discussion
In our trial no differences, on average, in sexual function at 24 months were observed between UAE and hysterectomy. After both treatments the dimensions “pleasure” and “habit” improved, while the dimension “discomfort” decreased at 24 months compared to baseline, although only the UAE group showed significant improvement in discomfort and frequency of intercourse.

]. In our patient group, however, there was no doubt about the indication: complaints were serious and lengthy enough to warrant a hysterectomy.
30
32

]. For obvious reasons, the prospects of deterioration of sexual life might be of greater concern to patients than the improvement after treatment. Regression analysis of worsened sexual life revealed that women with a low number of fibroids (possibly representing a group of women with less severe complaints) and women with other concomitant chronic diseases might not benefit from fibroid treatment in terms of sexual life improvement.

]. This was not confirmed by our results, but in accordance with these studies, a normal or even improved body image was found 1 year after hysterectomy.
There are several limitations of our study that need to be addressed. First, the values of the SAQ dimensions were based on all sexual active women at the various points in time. Reported values may reflect an ever-changing group of sexually active women. At any stage, some women may cease while others may initiate sexual activity. Of all non-sexually active women before treatment, 50% became active after treatment. When comparing pre- and posttreatment scores, these women cannot be included, since their baseline scores were missing.
Second, the significant difference between resumption of sexual activity between the groups at 6 weeks is probably explained by differences in counseling between both treatments as mentioned earlier: hysterectomy patients in our trial were told not to have sex until the first outpatient visit at 6 weeks, while UAE patients were advised to refrain from intercourse for at least 2 weeks and thereafter, depending on their complaints.
25

].
Finally, as described above, three questions on the BIS were omitted because of wrongly posed questions, thereby creating asymmetry in the treatment arms. Since the remaining questions in both groups were identical, the comparison between the groups is still valid but reduces the comparability with other series.
In conclusion, at 24 months no differences in sexuality and body image were observed between the UAE and the hysterectomy groups. After both UAE and hysterectomy, on average, sexual functioning and body image scores improved, but significantly so only after UAE.
