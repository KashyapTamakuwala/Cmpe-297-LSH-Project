-induced CREB phosphorylation and translocation of PKA to the nucleus, suggesting that crosstalk between PKA and EGFR underlies the oxidant-induced CREB response. Furthermore, knockdown of CREB expression using siRNA led to a decrease in bcl-2 and an increase in oxidant-induced apoptosis. Together these data reveal a novel role for crosstalk between PKA, ERK1/2 and CREB that mediates cell survival during oxidant stress.

Antibody binding was detected using horse radish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:5000; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West grove, PA), followed by chemiluminescence (Kirkgaard and Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD). QuantityOne (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) was used to quantify band density, and intensity of phospho-CREB bands were normalized to the intensity of the corresponding total CREB bands.

To visualize secondary antibody binding, the peroxidase substrate DAB (Sigma) was used. Coverslips were mounted onto slides with AquaPolyMount (Polysciences, Inc.

 increased with oxidant concentration but, with minor exception, were not dependent on whether oxidant was added by bolus or generated by glucose/glucose oxidase. Although reduction of the CREB response by PKA or EGFR inhibition was only significant for the higher oxidant concentrations, a trend was observed with lower concentrations. While it is difficult to accurately predict the physiological significance of these oxidant levels, when put in context with previous findings, these observations suggest that CREB signaling through PKA and EGFR could participate in signaling that affects both oxidant-mediated proliferation and apoptosis.

 generating system. The difference is likely due to the method of CREB inhibition, in that the dominant-negative CREB may have altered chromatin interactions with other transcription factors or caused quenching of the response. Putting these results in context with the findings of others, we propose that CREB activation through PKA signaling serves as a key survival pathway in cells responding to oxidant stress. PKA-and CREB-mediated gene expression may thus be important in regulating oxidant-mediated apoptosis resulting from lung pathologies, and future experiments will explore the importance of these signaling pathways in promoting changes in gene expression following lung epithelial cell injury or oxidant exposure.
