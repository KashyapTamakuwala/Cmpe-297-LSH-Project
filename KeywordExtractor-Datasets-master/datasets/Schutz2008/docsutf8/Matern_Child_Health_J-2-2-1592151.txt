]. One aspect of successful development of PCC guidelines involves knowledge of obstetrician-gynecologists’ current practices and opinions regarding PCC and what they perceive to be barriers to successful implementation of PCC. The purpose of this study was to assess the practices and opinions of obstetrician-gynecologists regarding PCC, and how frequently they perceive their patients to avail themselves of such services.

Materials and methods

].
The survey recorded demographic details of physicians and their patient population, and assessed practices and opinions regarding PCC. A questionnaire concerning screening for aneuploidy was included in the same mailing; both questionnaires shared a demographics section containing 9 questions on one page. The PCC questionnaire contained 11 questions, some multi-part, on two pages. Both questionnaires were brief and resulted in a final document of 3 double-sided pages, a standard length for our full-length questionnaires. Seven of the 11 questions on PCC involved rating the frequency of an activity (e.g., always, usually, occasionally, never) or degree of agreement with a statement, and three questions were of a multiple-choice format. The questionnaires were developed in consultation with medical specialists and were pilot tested on a sample of practicing obstetrician-gynecologists prior to final distribution.

Results
Demographics
A total of 670 questionnaires were returned. Data from 18 respondents were judged invalid (physician retired, returned to sender), resulting in a valid response rate of 60% (652/1087), 432 from CARN members (72.1% response rate) and 220 from Non-CARN (45.1% response rate). Physicians responded from every state of the United States except Maine, as well as the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Canada, and overseas military installations. The respondents’ mean age (47.32±0.39) and the proportion of males to females (males = 55%) closely matched those of the larger population to whom the survey was sent (46.99±0.32, males = 55%) and of ACOG Fellows and Junior Fellows in Practice as a whole (47.64, males = 58%).

Counseling in PCC
Almost a third (31.9%) of physicians said they discuss screening for aneuploidy with All patients who present for preconception counseling. Of those not selecting All, 80.7% said they did so with patients at risk for aneuploidy. Almost one-in-ten (9.8%) said they did not discuss aneuploidy. The majority (54.4%) of physicians said they discuss carrier screening for heritable genetic disorders (e.g., CF, sickle cell anemia) with All patients who present for preconception counseling, and, of those not selecting All, 84.8% said they did so with patients who have a family history of heritable genetic disorders or other risk factors. Only 4.3% said they did not discuss carrier screening.

Physicians were asked to indicate how many of the patients who presented for PCC did so for each of three reasons (7 point scale: None Few Some Half Many Most All). Over four-fifths (82.7%) of physicians indicated that more than half of the patients do so to ensure a healthy pregnancy (mean 5.63±0.062 on 7 pt scale). In contrast, 41.9% said more than half do so because of difficulties conceiving (mean 4.05±.058), and 20.0% said more than half do so because of an elevated risk of a birth defect or developmental disorder (mean 3.13±0.064).

). Far fewer obstetrician-gynecologists said they frequently recommend PCC to women described simply as sexually active (54%) or to those using birth control (36%). This suggests that our survey sample population views women who have consciously decided to plan a pregnancy as the most appropriate target group for PCC. Almost 9 in 10 (87%) physicians defined PCC as specialized pre-pregnancy care focusing on issues not typically addressed during a routine exam, and the remaining 13% defined it as routine well-woman care occurring during the reproductive years, prior to a pregnancy. Those who defined it as routine were more likely to offer such counseling to women who were sexually active or using birth control than were those defining it as specialized care.

). All were considered very important topics for counseling in PCC, with cigarette smoking and folic acid supplementation rated the most highly important for PCC. For counseling in routine care, folic acid supplementation received the second lowest score of all, with under two-fifths (37%) of physicians rating it as important. This points to the need for continued national attention to increase consumption and supplementation of folic acid.
Our study has limitations that should be acknowledged. The response rate was 60%, and our findings are based on the responses of 579 non-subspecialist obstetricians and gynecologists. While our study may be subject to non-response bias, we believe that our findings are reliable. The typical response rate in these survey studies is approximately 35–60%, and our response rate was at the high end of expected participation. In addition, the responses were derived from geographically diverse locations and from physicians from different practice types reflecting the influence of physician location and practice type. Whereas physicians who were more interested in the topic of the survey may have been more likely to respond, a subset of our subject pool was comprised of CARN members who respond to several questionnaires a year covering a wide variety of topics; it is unlikely that Preconception Care is a topic of greater interest to this group than to the group of randomly selected ACOG members. CARN members differed significantly from non-CARN subjects on only one non-demographic response, and the mean age and male to female ratio of respondents closely matched those of the larger group to whom the survey was sent and of ACOG Fellows and Junior Fellows as a whole, all of which suggests that response bias was minimized.

]. They also found that physician recommendations influenced women's decisions to take folic acid.
Obstetrician-gynecologists recognize the importance of preconception care and provide this care for their patients. However, lack of third party reimbursement, lack of time during office visits due to competing demands, and lack of consumer awareness pose barriers to effective implementation of PCC. The fact that almost half of all pregnancies in the U.S. are unplanned poses an even greater challenge. Continued efforts are needed to raise awareness of the importance of PCC by consumers, health care providers, third party carriers, and policy makers.
