Introduction
The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of a 12-month Balance Training Program on balance, mobility and falling frequency in women with osteoporosis.

Methods
Sixty-six consecutive elderly women were selected from the Osteometabolic Disease Outpatient Clinic and randomized into 2 groups: the ‘Intervention’, submitted for balance training; and the ‘Control’, without intervention. Balance, mobility and falling frequency were evaluated before and at the end of the trial, using the Berg Balance Scale (BBS), the Clinical Test Sensory Interaction Balance (CTSIB) and the Timed “Up & Go” Test (TUGT). Intervention used techniques to improve balance consisting of a 1-hour session each week and a home-based exercise program.

The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effect of a 12-month balance training program on functional and static balance, mobility and falling frequency in women with osteoporosis.

Patients and methods
Patient sample
23
] were included; with a bone mineral density (BMD) T-score lower than −2.5 standard deviation (SD), in the lumbar spine, femoral neck or total femur region.
24
25
].
The patients were randomized consecutively into two groups: the group submitted for the Balance Training Program (Intervention Group), consisting of 34 patients; and the Control group, consisting of 32 patients without intervention. The Control group only received treatment for osteoporosis and orientation to prevent falls and return regularly (3-monthly follow-ups) to the Osteometabolic Disease Outpatient Clinic. All patients read and signed a term of free informed consent that described the procedures which would be realized during the research.

Measured variables: interview and medical chart records
Personal, family and clinical data were evaluated through an interview and medical chart records, with emphasis on the history of fractures, number of falls in the preceding year, use of medication for osteoporosis, and use of medication that favored the risk of falling, such as hypnotics, hypotensors and antidepressants.

Functional state evaluation
Static and dynamic balance and mobility were evaluated in all patients, before and at the end of the trial, by a physiotherapist who was blinded to the distinct group (Intervention, Control).
Functional balance
26
]. The maximum score that can be achieved is 56, and each item possesses an ordinal scale of five alternatives which varies from 0 to 4 points.

27
].

Static balance
Static balance was evaluated by the Clinical Test of Sensory Interaction for Balance (CTSIB), which consists of six sensory conditions (1: eyes open and firm surface, 2: eyes closed and firm surface, 3: eyes open, visual conflict and firm surface, 4: eyes open and unstable surface, 5: eyes closed and unstable surface, and 6: eyes open, visual conflict and unstable surface).
28
].
Improvement in the test was defined as the capacity to complete the test during the final evaluation when unable to complete the same in the initial evaluation.

Functional mobility

], which registers the time an individual takes to get up out of a chair, walk 3 meters, turn around, walk back and sit down again.
Elderly individuals without balance deficit are capable of completing the test in less than 10 seconds.


Falls

] was solicited and noted in the initial evaluation and at the end of the trial (final evaluation). During the year of the study, patients in both groups received a diary and were orientated to write down the days that they fell.
At the end of the study, the difference in the number of falls/patient (final evaluation - initial evaluation) was compared between the Intervention Group and Control.

Intervention

Basic warm-up and stretching exercises
Prior to training, the patients participated in 15 min of warm-up and stretching exercises, consisting of head rotation, shoulder rotation and stretching of the upper and lower limbs. Walking was performed for 15 min with the supervision of a physiotherapist, who associated exercises for the upper limbs throughout the walk.

Home-based exercises
The patients were instructed and encouraged to continue the same exercises at home at least three times a week for 30 min. A manual with instructions and illustrations for each exercise was distributed. The frequency of participation in the home-based exercises was noted each week by the physiotherapist.

Adherence rate
A high level of adherence was observed. Sixty percent of the patients participated in all of the exercise sessions at the club and absences occurred with the following justifications: doctor’s appointment, the realization of laboratory exams or for personal reasons. In relation to home-based exercise, 76.67% of the patients realized exercises at least once a week, 40% of the patients exercised every day and 36.67% from one to four times a week.

Discussion
Few studies have been developed regarding balance training in patients with osteoporosis. The present longitudinal prospective study demonstrated that a program of balance training realized over a period of 12 months was effective in improving the functional and static balance, mobility and diminishing the number of falls in elderly women with osteoporosis.
32
], where the patients who participated in the balance training obtained 64% improvement in 3 months. The authors showed that the group who underwent the balance training demonstrated better performance than the group submitted to muscular strength training.

].
34
35
].
24
] obtained an improvement in static balance using muscular strength training rather than balance training, though only in 6.3% of the patients. Thus, the present findings suggest that balance training leads to more evident positive results in static balance than does muscular strength training.
