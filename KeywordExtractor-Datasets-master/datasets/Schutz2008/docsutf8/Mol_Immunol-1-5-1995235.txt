Abstract
In mouse, genes encoding complement regulators CD55 and CD59 have been duplicated. The first described form of CD59, CD59a, is broadly distributed in mouse tissues, while the later identified CD59b was originally described as testis specific. Subsequent studies have been contradictory, some reporting widespread and abundant expression of CD59b. Resolution of the distribution patterns of the CD59 isoforms is important for interpretation of disease studies utilising CD59 knockout mice. Here we have performed a comprehensive distribution study of the CD59 isoforms at the mRNA and protein levels. These data confirm that expression of CD59b is essentially restricted to adult testis; trace expression in other tissues is a consequence of contamination with blood cells, shown previously to express CD59b at low level. In testis, onset of expression of CD59b coincided with puberty and was predominant on the spermatozoal acrosome. Ligation of CD59b, but not CD59a, markedly reduced spermatozoal motility, suggesting a specific role in reproductive function.

). The appropriateness of the techniques used and specificity of probes and primers have all been questioned. These authors concluded that CD59b was broadly expressed and an important regulator of MAC assembly on erythrocytes and in tissues.
We, and others, are using CD59a knockout mice in disease models to explore roles of MAC based on our evidence that CD59a is the principal regulator of the MAC in most tissues. If CD59b is indeed widely distributed then the value of studies in CD59a knockouts is in question. It is therefore essential that we test the evidence. Here using multiple methods we revisit these published studies and undertake new analyses to explore the expression patterns of CD59a and CD59b at the mRNA and protein level. We conclude that expression of CD59b at the mRNA and protein level is essentially absent in all tissues other than testis. Low level expression on blood cells was confirmed and trace detection of mRNA in tissues was shown to be likely due to blood contamination. We further analysed expression of CD59b in testis and showed that expression coincided with onset of puberty and was restricted to spermatozoa and their immediate precursors. Ligation of CD59b on spermatozoa with monoclonal antibody markedly inhibited sperm motility, suggesting a specific role in reproductive function.

). Separate aliquots of CD59a.1 and CD59b.2 were labelled with NHS-biotin (Sigma–Aldrich, Gillingham, Dorset, UK) and FITC-NHS (Perbio Science UK Ltd., Cramlington, UK) according to manufacturer's protocols. As negative controls, rat IgG1 and mouse IgG1 (purified in-house) were labelled in the same manner. FITC-labelled streptavidin was purchased from DAKO (Ely, Cambridgeshire, UK). HRPO-labeled donkey anti-rat IgG and HRPO-labeled donkey anti-mouse IgG were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Europe (Newmarket, Suffolk, UK).

). Either 25 or 35 amplification cycles were used, except where attempting simultaneous detection of both mRNAs when 40 cycles were performed. Amplified products were separated either in 1% agarose or in 5% poly-acrylamide gels (PAAG). To obtain semi-quantitative data for expression of the two genes, we used as templates either 2 μl of the original cDNA, or a series of dilutions as indicated in figures. Gels were scanned and band intensity was measured by densitometry using Quantity One 4.3.0 software (BioRad, Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, UK). The quantifications were carried out in triplicate and means and errors calculated.

 to specifically amplify CD59b in a quantitative PCR (QPCR). Because these primers were not designed specifically for this assay, they did not meet the optimal annealing temperature requirements. To correct for this anomaly, the standard amplification programme was modified to include a pre-annealing step at 56 °C for 20 s prior to the extension phase.

2.6
SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis
Lysates were mixed 1:1 with sample buffer for SDS-PAGE and separated under non-reducing conditions in 15% gels. Separated proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell, London, UK), and membranes blocked with 5% (w/v) non-fat milk in PBS (PBS-M). Membranes were then probed with the primary mAb diluted in PBS-M, washed in PBS containing 0.1% Tween-20 (PBS-T), then probed with HRPO-conjugated donkey anti-rat Ig in PBS-M to detect the rat anti-CD59a or HRPO-conjugated donkey anti-mouse Ig (Jackson) to detect the mouse anti-CD59b. After further washing in PBS-T, bands were developed using ECL (Perbio Science UK Ltd.) and captured on autoradiographic film (Kodak Ltd., Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, UK).

Acrosome-reacted and control spermatozoa were smeared on glass slides and immediately air-dried. To observe CD59b distribution, the smears were incubated with FITC-labeled CD59b.2. Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (4′-6-diamino-2-phenylindole-2 HCl; 100 ng/ml final concentration; Sigma–Aldrich).

). Of note, QPCR with either primer set did not detect any CD59b mRNA in liver, suggesting that the high cycle number PCR described above was detecting very small amounts of mRNA in these tissues. In summary, the data shows an 8-fold greater expression of CD59a mRNA in liver compared to testis, a 5-fold greater expression of CD59a mRNA compared to CD59b in testis and undetectable expression of CD59b in liver, regardless of primer set used.

E). For comparison, expression of CD59b in testis was 2200-fold higher than in unperfused liver and approximately 25,000-fold higher than in perfused liver. Taken together these results strongly suggest that the detectable traces of CD59b mRNA in liver and likely other organs are a consequence of contamination with blood cells.

CD59a was present in all the lysates, albeit at low level in spermatozoa and with a reduced apparent molecular mass compared with the testis protein, suggesting modification during sperm maturation.

 data were supported by RT-PCR analyses using primer sets specific for CD59a and CD59b, respectively that showed abundant expression of CD59b mRNA in all tissues tested, indeed, expression in testis was lower than in other organs. The apparent absence of CD59b mRNA in the CD59a knockout mouse in these published data was unexplained.

Fig. 1
RT-PCR detection of CD59a and CD59b in mouse tissues. Primer pairs described in the text and specific for each isoform were used for the PCR step and either 25 (A) or 35 (B) amplification cycles were carried out. Using these primers, an approximately 350 bp product was obtained from CD59a mRNA and was readily detected in all tissues after 25 cycles. CD59b mRNA was detected after 25 cycles in testis only and the product size was approximately 400 bp. After 35 cycles of amplification, this product was detected in all tissues.



Fig. 2
RT-PCR analysis of expression of CD59a and CD59b using common primers. A new primer pair was designed from identical sequences within exon 4 of CD59a and CD59b mRNA and used to amplify mRNA from testis (A) and liver (B). Forty amplification cycles were carried out using different dilutions of cDNA (shown above) as template. The amplified products were 199 bp-long for CD59a and 162 bp-long for CD59b. Products were separated in 5% PAAG. Intensity of the bands was measured and the CD59a/CD59b ratio calculated from three independent experiments (given below each band pair in A). This ratio was approximately 1 when the cDNA template was not diluted or diluted 5-fold, indicating that amplification has reached saturation. However, the calculated ratio was around 5 for higher dilutions of the template, suggesting that amplification at the final point was in the linear range.
