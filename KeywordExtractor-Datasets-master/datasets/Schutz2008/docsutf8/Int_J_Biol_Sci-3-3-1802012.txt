2007
The past five years have seen a tremendous rise in porcine transcriptomic data. Available porcine Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs) have expanded greatly, with over 623,000 ESTs deposited in Genbank. ESTs have been used to expand the pig-human comparative maps, but such data has also been used in many ways to understand pig gene expression. Several methods have been used to identify genes differentially expressed (DE) in specific tissues or cell types under different treatments. These include open screening methods such as suppression subtractive hybridization, differential display, serial analysis of gene expression, and EST sequence frequency, as well as closed methods that measure expression of a defined set of sequences such as hybridization to membrane arrays and microarrays. The use of microarrays to begin large-scale transcriptome analysis has been recently reported, using either specialized or broad-coverage arrays. This review covers published results using the above techniques in the pig, as well as unpublished data provided by the research community, and reports on unpublished Affymetrix data from our group. Published and unpublished bioinformatics efforts are discussed, including recent work by our group to integrate two broad-coverage microarray platforms. We conclude by predicting experiments that will become possible with new anticipated tools and data, including the porcine genome sequence. We emphasize that the need for bioinformatics infrastructure to efficiently store and analyze the expanding amounts of gene expression data is critical, and that this deficit has emerged as a limiting factor for acceleration of genomic understanding in the pig.

Finally, while still in its infancy, we will discuss published and other publicly reported work on the development and use of bioinformatics and databases to analyze porcine gene expression data.

) shows 575,730 ESTs and 6,854 expressed transcripts from a total of 257 cDNA libraries. This release identifies 64,746 tentative clusters (TCs) and 88,117 singleton ESTs and ETs. Many of these ESTs have been submitted within the past three years, showing the great strides taken recently; since January 2004 (Release 8.0), the number of TCs in the Pig Gene Index has nearly tripled. Additional information on these databases and others is discussed in the section on bioinformatics.

 to determine the efficacy of normalization of cDNA libraries, which is performed to remove the highly expressed (and therefore high frequency) transcripts, allowing for increased efficiency in finding new gene transcripts through random EST sequencing. Finally, both UniGene and SsGI (now the Dana Farber Cancer Institute Pig Gene Index) provide global views of gene expression levels based on EST frequency (see later section).

These reports describe the use of DD to study response to viral infection; liver-specific expression and hepatic response to dietary changes; and gene expression changes in response to selection for improved reproductive traits.

Quantitative PCR Methods as the “Gold” Standard in Confirming Differential Expression Results

, as well as microarray or other profiling data (see specific results in the following microarray section), as QPCR has been the standard technique used to validate such results. This comparison is not as direct as one might wish, as properly run QPCR measures the abundance of a single transcript or transcript segment. Thus microarray data, which may result form hybridization of multiple transcript isoforms to a probe or probes on an array, may not be confirmed by a QPCR assay even though the microarray data is not necessarily incorrect. In fact, some microarray-based technologies, such as the Affymetrix platform, have multiple oligonucleotides that interrogate multiple locations along a gene transcript. Thus data may be available to identify differential abundance of different segments of transcripts, allowing measurement of differential expression of splice variants. On the other hand, QPCR is clearly more sensitive and often shows an increase in the level of difference (fold change) between the class or treatments being compared than seen in microarray data. It is therefore important to recognize both the strengths and weaknesses of each of these techniques in such confirmation studies.

4. But What Does It All Mean? Pig Expression Bioinformatics and Databases
At this juncture, available swine transcriptomic data, especially for microarray projects, is somewhat fragmented and sparse. Many different platforms are being used and the data is not always being submitted to a common repository. The recent public disclosure of nearly a million additional ESTs from 97 different non-normalized libraries by the Sino-Danish consortium (Gorodkin et al., submitted) will certainly improve the accuracy of EST frequency data as an estimate of expression level. To become more efficient at drawing biological meaning out of such data, more attention needs to be paid to public sharing of data and integration of that data so that an increase in power is possible. In this section, we discuss the available public resources for pig microarray and other transcriptomic data and discuss some of our efforts to integrate these platforms and data sources.

), which uses a specific format for loading and exporting data. As of October 2006, GEO currently includes 18 porcine experiments, and the platform designs for 19 platforms, including the two large commercial platforms: Affymetrix 24k Porcine GeneChip® and several versions of spotted platforms using the Qiagen-Operon-NRSP8 13k oligonucleotide set. Of the 18 experiments, the majority were performed on microarrays, though three used SAGE. The user interface at NCBI for text or BLAST-based searches is advanced, allowing searches to be refined to search specific sub-databases or with other limits.

), and uses the Minimal Information About Microarray Experiments (MIAME) standards created by the Microarray Gene Expression Data Society (MGED). ArrayExpress, as of October 23, 2006, has a single porcine expression study, the main bulk of the data being human and mouse.

). The PGI database is the TIGR Gene Indices information that was brought to Dana Farber by John Quackenbush. The PGI database is similar to UniGene in that it clusters ESTs together, but goes a step further and provides a tentative consensus sequence for each cluster. Also, unlike UniGene which tries to group alternative spliced genes together, PGI attempts to separate them into their own, unique clusters. However, it does provide a link that clusters the tentative alternatively spliced sequences together. The DF database also provides Gene Ontology (GO) annotations, metabolic pathway information, and predicted 70-mer oligonucleotide sequences and SNP information for each of their TCs. Both UniGene and DFGIP data collections can be searched using BLAST, and an expression summary of each of the EST's based on the libraries, and EST count within the libraries, is provided. Both data collections can also be downloaded for local investigator use.

). They have submitted their sequences to the Trace Archive at NCBI, but these data have not, as of October 2006, been integrated into dbEST. They have made their clusters available online, and have provided a bulk download website for both the ESTs and the consensus sequences of their clusters. Expression profiles for all the genes are also provided, based on EST frequency within the 97 non-normalized libraries. They predict SNPs based on sequence discrepancies within alignments, as the libraries were created from tissues from multiple breeds. They provide some online tools, including viewing the aligned and clustered sequences as well as searches against the database using BLAST. The website indicates these data have been submitted for publication (Gorodkin et al., submitted).

. It also contains a mixed tissue porcine library. To annotate the ESTs, the database uses homology searches to various NCBI databases, including RefSeq and Gene. To search the libraries, keywords based on this information transferred from GenBank can be searched; there is also an option to use BLAST to search the different libraries. Clones and clusters can be viewed to determine which libraries have sequences donating to the clusters, and clones are available for order. In addition to the EST information, there is a private internal section for microarrays.

 and references therein). They identified the full-length cDNAs within the ESTs. Their online interface allows a user to search their EST/cDNA clusters using keywords, library, their accession numbers, and the corresponding human chromosome. It allows filtering the results based on evidence of SNP in a specific breed, and provides suggested primers for detection of the SNP. Like the Sino-Danish EST database and the PGI database, it provides a visual alignment of the ESTs to each other and to the cluster consensus sequence. A unique feature of this database is a more in-depth analysis of artiodactyl-specific antigens for furthering the development of xenotransplantation.

). Their aim is to integrate various types of expression data, including microarray, proteomics, and metabolomics, to compare genetically modified foods. Their first goal is to compare the EnviroPig to the Yorkshire.
A fourth database currently under construction is at Iowa State University (URL pending). Our focus is storage and analysis of data from the Affymetrix platform, although Qiagen-Operon-NRSP8 platform data is also curated. One specific interest is using expression data to help identify tissue-selective genes and across-species expression comparison of such genes to recognize evolutionarily conserved regulatory modules of interest to pig genome scientists. Here we describe some of our efforts in this area; integration and comparison of data from the two broad-coverage platforms that currently exist for the pig; the Qiagen-Operon-NRSP8 13K oligonucleotide array (hereafter abbreviated the Operon array) and the Affymetrix 23K Porcine GeneChip® (abbreviated the Affymetrix chip), both of which were discussed above.

). The different classes most likely result from the difference in the known amount of porcine sequence during the development of the probes/probe sets; the Operon probes being designed in 2002, while the Affymetrix probe sets were designed in 2004. This helps explains the different classes: Class 4 from the merging of old clusters, Class 5 from Affymetrix designing separate probe sets for alternative transcripts (which might not have been known in 2002) or that the Operon probe is no longer unique (for example, now targeting multiple genes in the same family), and Class 6 from the joining of different consensus sequences into single genes, but then having alternative splicing.
32

. To take a step beyond simple agreement of presence/absence, we also calculated the correlation of expression level for each gene as estimated by each platform. We ranked each gene by expression level and used the Spearman's Rank correlation to determine the extent of agreement for relative expression of each gene within the common set of genes.

 =0.97 for the within platform comparison, with an present/absent agreement of 82%.
Since Class 5 has the lowest agreement and correlations (equal to Class 3 for cross platform correlations, but with a lower within platform correlation), this result indicates that the Operon probes could cross-hybridize to either alternative splice variants or gene family members with close sequence homology that the Affymetrix platform was designed to assay separately. Further investigation is needed to see if the Operon probe is present, while the Affymetrix probe sets are absent, or if there are multiple Affymetrix probe sets present while the single Operon is absent. The results for Class 4, which have the highest agreement and the best correlation, lends support to the proposal that multiple Operon probes target the same gene product—likely by the clustering of sequences from the time the Operon chip was developed to the time the Affymetrix chip was developed. While these results already show good agreement between platforms, it will be important to update the sequence comparisons on a regular basis, especially with the Sino-Danish data, as well as the genome sequence, coming online. As part of our database we plan to develop the means to regularly develop a consensus sequence for each gene from all available sequences to map the various probes and probe sets to each other.

5. Conclusions
Functional genomics data, primarily at the RNA level currently, is accumulating rapidly for the pig species. Excellent, sensitive and broadly useful tools are already available and more will be become available within the next year. Annotation of the draft porcine genome sequence, expected in late 2007 and into 2008, will allow rapid integration of the gene expression data discussed above with gene sequences, potential splice sites, and gene families within the draft sequence. Advances in other areas of investigation in pig genetics and genomics can be anticipated. One such area would be the ability to find common regulatory sites within flanking DNA of co-expressed/co-regulated genes; leading to the identification of critical regulatory proteins in common with, or distinct from, those found in other species. Such information will reinforce the discovery of pathways through gene list annotations, improve pathway understanding through differentiation of direct targets from indirect targets of transcriptional signals, and would identify targets for manipulation of complete pathways and systems. We can also anticipate the comprehensive integration of linkage mapping and expression profiling of the same population, termed eQTL studies. Such integration of functional and structural genomic data will dramatically improve our understanding of the genetic architecture controlling quantitative traits in pigs. eQTL analyses may lead to the first application of “systems biology” to genetic improvement in the pig through the identification of cis-regulatory variation controlling an economically important phenotype.
83
. It is unfortunate that many datasets are not being submitted to public repositories; it is our hope and expectation that journals will both facilitate and require such public submissions, as is more the norm in the biomedical fields. Many groups are working on this bioinformatics effort and therefore the near future in pig genomics is especially exciting. The long-term goal of the application of genome data to improve pig genetics will be reached when we can apply a more robust understanding of pig genetic pathways to identify variation at genes controlling important traits of interest in the pig.

Figures and Tables
Figure 1
Gene Expression patterns can be clustered to identify pathways of genes acting in concert. To investigate the host transcriptional profile at early immune response stage during the ST infection, genes showing differential expression among all possible comparisons in the ST infection (p<0.01, fc>2, q<0.24) were used to perform the cluster analysis by the K-Medoids clustering method. A. 15 clusters which presented variable expression patterns were identified. The x axis is time points after infection (un-infected animals or 8h, 24h, 48h post-infection) and the y axis shows the normalized gene expression level. The green line in each cluster is the medoid value for expression in each cluster, the pattern representative of all genes in the cluster. B. Most of the genes in cluster 4 showed a slight down-regulation at 8 hpi, but were induced with peak response at 24 hpi during the ST infection. A majority of genes in this cluster are INFG and its induced genes, cytokines and chemokines, NFkB target genes, and other immune related genes. ST: Salmonella Typhimurium; PAM: Partitioning Around Medoids.

*For the Affymetrix GeneChip®, the MAS5 report had to agree at least 75% of the time for a probe set to be declared present or absent (all marginal calls were ignored). Hence for the first Affymetrix experiment five out of the six chips had to agree on the P/A calls, and for the second Affymetrix experiment three out of the four chips had to have the same P/A calls; leading to 7,362 of the pairings to be compared for their agreement.
**For the correlation, the mean values of the log normalized raw values were used for each probe within the pair. A Spearman's Rank correlation was then preformed on the means; comparing the Operon platform results to each of the two Affymetrix experiments.
