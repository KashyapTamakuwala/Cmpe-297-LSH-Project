Background
This study assessed the effectiveness of computerized measurement and feedback of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in daily clinical practice in patients with chronic liver disease.

Methods
One hundred and sixty-two patients (61% men; mean age 47.5 years) regularly completed computerized HRQoL questionnaires before each consultation for the duration of 1 year. Six physicians were randomly assigned to the experimental group and received an instant online graphical output of data. Five other physicians were randomly assigned to the control group and conducted their consultations as usual. Differences between groups on generic- and disease-specific HRQoL, patient management, and patient satisfaction with the consultation were assessed, as were physicians’ experiences with HRQoL data and effects on their consultations.

Conclusions
Computerized measurement and feedback of HRQoL in a daily clinical practice of an outpatient department of hepatology did not improve HRQoL for the entire group of chronic liver patients but, rather, improved disease-specific HRQoL of older patients with chronic liver disease and mental HRQoL of older patients and male patients with chronic liver disease. It also had an effect on patient management.

A possible explanation might be that the majority of existing studies assessing the effectiveness of HRQoL measurement in clinical practice with regard to patients’ psychosocial functioning or HRQoL have included oncological patients or patients from general practice. Oncological patients can be considered a special group due to the life-threatening nature of the disease. Patients from general practice, on the other hand, may be too diverse and often present with generally minor complaints, which may hamper the discovery of beneficial effects. Both groups impede generalization of results to other chronic patient populations.

]. CLD is an appropriate example of a typical chronic disease, with patients experiencing substantial comorbidity and possibly mortality, as is the case in other chronic diseases such as kidney disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

]. In addition, in our study, physicians rather than patients were assigned to the control or the experimental group. This assigning of physicians to only one group prevents bias of physicians being focused on discussing HRQoL when seeing patients in the control group.
The aims of the study were twofold: the first was to assess the effectiveness of real-time computerized measurement of HRQoL in various patients with CLD and presentation of the results to physicians before the consultation in terms of improvement in patient HRQoL, patient management, and patient satisfaction with the consultation by means of a randomized trial with repeated measurements. The second aim was to assess hepatologists’ experiences with the availability of real-time HRQoL patient data and to measure the possible effect(s) it had on their consultations.

Patients and methods
Patient recruitment
This study was performed at the Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology of the Erasmus Medical Centre, Rotterdam, where HRQoL measurement on a regular basis was implemented for the duration of 1 year. All patients older than 17 years of age with CLD visiting the department between September 2004 and January 2005 were invited to participate. Written information about the study was sent to the patients 3 days before their consultation at the outpatient department. Patients interested in participating informed their physician, who consequently directed them to the researcher for further explanation of the study and to sign informed consent. For this effectiveness study, we included all patients with two or more measurement moments. All physicians working at the Department of Hepatology participated. The protocol was in accordance with the ethical guidelines of the modified 1975 Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the Erasmus MC.

Study objectives
The primary aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of computerized measurement of HRQoL in clinical practice. The primary outcome measures were patients’ generic HRQoL (physical and mental component score separately) and disease-specific HRQoL. Secondary outcome measures were patient satisfaction with the consultation and patient management. The secondary aim of this study was to assess hepatologists’ experiences with the availability of real-time HRQoL patient data.

Study design and intervention
Physicians
Physicians were randomly assigned to either the experimental or control group by means of a restricted randomization procedure called blocking. To ensure an equal number of physicians in each group, it was decided to include six in the experimental group and five in the control group. We used a random sequence table to assign physicians to one of the conditions. Due to the nature of the intervention, it was impossible to blind physicians to group assignment.

Patients
Through the random assignment of physicians, patients were indirectly allocated to either group. Patients were initially blinded to the group assignment. All patients participating in the study completed a computerized generic- and disease-specific HRQoL questionnaire and the first part of a pen-and-paper questionnaire on patient satisfaction with the consultation before each consultation at the outpatient Department of Hepatology for 1 year. They also completed the second part of the satisfaction questionnaire after the consultation. More specific information on the content of the questionnaires is provided in “Study measures”. To ascertain good questionnaire completion, a researcher was always available to answer questions about the computer and/or questionnaires at the patient’s request.

Patient management
The effect of the intervention on patient management was measured by means of a checklist that physicians completed after each consultation with a study participant, including the question: “Have you changed your treatment in any way?” and a subquestion: “If so, what have you done?” followed by several options: “Prescription of antidepressants,” “Referral to psychosocial care,” “Altering the frequency of consultations,” and “Other.”

Physicians’ experiences
Experiences of physicians with the experimental condition were assessed through the checklists that they completed after each consultation with a study participant, asking the question: “Did you find the HRQoL information useful? Why?” with the answering options: “Yes, it provided new information,” “Yes, it saved time,” “Yes...,” “No, the patient is doing well,” “No, I know this patient well enough,” “No, the patient tells me a lot,” “No...”. Also, a semistructured interview was conducted 6 months into the study and at the end of the study. The interview included questions about the effort to request HRQoL information, the usefulness of the information, whether the availability of HRQoL information increased the duration of the consultation, and whether participating patients addressed HRQoL issues more often than patients who did not participate. Physicians were also asked whether there were certain subgroups of patients whose HRQoL information they found particularly useful. Opinions of physicians in the control group toward possible future availability of HRQoL information during the consultation were assessed by means of the same semistructured interview at 6 months only.

]. Thereby, the background characteristic(s), in this case diagnosis, was reduced to one single score, the propensity score. We calculated the propensity score by entering the different diagnoses (HBV, HCV, cholestatic liver disease, pretransplantation, posttransplantation, autoimmune hepatitis, and other) as dummy variables (M-1) in a logistic regression analysis. The unstandardized logistic regression weights were then multiplied by the relevant dummy variable and summed, together with the constant. This score was used in the univariate analysis to adjust for baseline confounding.
Univariate analyses of variance were performed for each outcome variable (disease-specific HRQoL and generic HRQoL MCS and PCS) separately. A forward technique was used in which the main effects of the fixed factors were assessed in the first block, and the interactions between feedback of HRQoL data and each of the other fixed factors (age, gender, severity of the disease) were explored in the second block. Differences between the two groups on patient management variables and satisfaction with the consultation were assessed by means of Mann–Whitney tests.
Hepatologists’ experiences with the availability of real-time patient HRQoL data was assessed by means of semistructured interviews and checklists. These data were of a descriptive nature and are presented as such.

Physicians’ experiences with the availability of HRQoL information in clinical practice
Experiences of physicians in the experimental group at 6 months and at the end of the study did not differ. All physicians in the experimental condition found the HRQoL information useful, except for one older physician who claimed to know his patients very well. They indicated being better able to understand some of their patients through the extra information that was provided by the questionnaires. These physicians did not perceive requesting the information as an extra effort on their part. Furthermore, they did not think that using the information lengthened their consultations. All physicians in the experimental group indicated that they wanted to continue using the HRQoL information in the future. Physicians in the control group were similarly positive toward the possible availability of HRQoL information during their consultations in the future, on the condition that it would not be time consuming. This specifically concerned patients awaiting liver transplantation, patients with hepatitis C, and nonnative speakers (mostly patients with hepatitis B).

], which is in line with findings of our study. It should be noted that due to the cross-sectional data analyses, a causal relationship between intervention and HRQoL could not be demonstrated. Future studies should address this in further detail.

]. The lack of observed differences between the study groups may have been due to high levels of satisfaction, resulting in a ceiling effect.

]. However, it should be noted that even though the differences in patient management between control experimental groups were statistically significant, the absolute numbers were small. Therefore, the results should be interpreted cautiously, and further studies using more elaborate methods of data collection—for instance, monitoring patients’ medical records or administering more detailed checklists—are recommended.

]. Future studies should shed more light on whether the availability of HRQoL information increases the length of consultations in hepatology.
The strength of our study lies in the analyses performed, where benefits for specific groups of liver patients were explored by entering interactions between gender, age, disease severity, and feedback of HRQoL data, rather than solely investigating main effects between the intervention and control groups. Also, this study included patients with CLD rather than patients with cancer or patients from general practice, making it especially relevant to a more general population of patients with a chronic illness.
We are aware of several limitations of this study. First, physicians rather than patients were randomly assigned to either the intervention or control group. Randomization is a complicated issue in these kinds of implementation studies, and both methods are subject to limitations. An important advantage of the randomization of physicians is that the control group was not biased toward mentioning HRQoL topics more often than usual. Future studies using the same design but including more physicians are needed to further explore possible main effects of HRQoL measurement on patients’ overall HRQoL. A second limitation was the high number of nonparticipants. Part of the explanation may lie in the fact that patients were responsible for contacting their physician if they were interested in participating in the study. In addition, the number of non-Dutch-speaking patients visiting the department is relatively large (hepatitis B, for example, is most common among people from North Africa). These patients were also invited to participate but were less likely to respond. The relatively large number of patients who completed the questionnaires only once may be explained by the small window of opportunity to complete the questionnaires before each consultation. In addition, for such implementation endeavors, cooperation of all staff members is essential, and future research should explore this further. A last limitation of this study was that the checklists used to assess consultation content were not very detailed. This was done on purpose, as longer inventories would have compromised physician participation. However, considering the positive outcomes of this study, it is advisable that future studies consider ways to obtain a more detailed view of how the HRQoL information affects consultation content, for example, by recording consultations.
In conclusion, although a main effect of the intervention was not found, this study showed a beneficial effect of implementation of HRQoL measurement in clinical practice on the HRQoL of older and male patients with CLD and on patient management. Nevertheless, the study had several shortcomings, and further studies are needed to substantiate these findings. Physicians’ experiences with the availability of HRQoL information were positive, especially for patients awaiting liver transplantation, patients with hepatitis C, and nonnative speakers. They expressed an interest in continued use of HRQoL information. These results advocate the continued use of measuring HRQoL in a clinical practice of hepatology. Including older patients and male patients, who have been shown to benefit most from such a procedure, should be aimed for.
