 under various hormone conditions, N6 liquid media containing 1, 2, 5, 10 or 20 mg/l 2,4-D with or without 0.1 mg/l BA were used.

Phenotyping
Ten to twenty-five seeds were planted per line. Germination rates and seedling phenotypes were observed in the nursery. After 1 month from seeding, the seedlings were transferred to the paddy field. Phenotypes in the field were observed at the vegetative stage, near the heading stage, at the seed maturation stage, and at harvest. Lines segregating abnormal plants at about 25% frequency were digitally photographed and assigned a phenotype ID.

For the map training program, vsom, parameters for first learning: 1000 for learning length in training, 0.05 for initial learning rate, 10 for initial radius of the training area in som-algorithm, parameters for second learning: 10000 for learning length, 0.02 for initial learning rate, 3 for initial radius. The analyzed data were visualized using the umat program.

 plants of each line were observed over a full developmental cycle in the nursery and paddy.
Each line was designated by “N” for “Nipponbare” followed by a letter A-G that indicates the yearly lot, and four figures, e.g. NA1234. Lines named with “NA” and “NB” were used in a small-scale pilot study and “NC” to “NG” were used in large-scale studies.

There was no significant difference in observed transposition events among lines derived from the subcultures. In lots, ND, NE, NF, and NG, calli were induced in a medium containing 2 mg/l 2,4-D, and maintained in a medium supplemented with 1 mg/l 2,4-D for 5 months. The cultural conditions for each line are available with the phenotypic description list from the mutant panel database.

Classification of phenotypes

Germination. This trait was evaluated by measuring germination rate under defined conditions. Since wild type (cv. Nipponbare) showed a germination rate higher than 95%, lines that showed germination rates less than 75% were recorded in the present project. Since several laboratories measured germination rates of all lines, all primary data are also stored in the database. In total, 3489 lines showed a low germination rate, and 525 lines showed germination rates less than 50%. Some of the lines with low germination rates may be embryo mutants.

, NG0667) mutants have open and recumbent tillers. A quite unusual phenotype among “High tillering” lines is NG2552 that produced tillers reiteratively from upper internodes and failed to produce panicles.

Heading date. In this category, lines whose heading date deviated more than 7 days from normal were classified as heading date mutants. This category includes “Early heading”, “Late heading”, and “Non-heading?” mutants. A small number of lines segregated as “Non-heading?” mutants that did not form panicles even at harvest (five to 6 months after sowing). The number of “Early heading” lines (1797) is a little larger than that of “Late heading” lines (1244).

Seed. Only “Large grain”, “Small grain”, and “Slender grain” were distinguished in this category. The frequency of “Small grain” was two and four times higher than the frequency of “Large grain” and “Slender grain”, respectively. Among the “Others”, white or dull kernel phenotypes were often observed.

 have a very strong correlation. This result suggests that the gene involved in leaf length also affects panicle length. On the contrary, long leaf and dwarfism, at the opposite corner of the map, do not have any correlation. Both dwarf and semi-dwarf phenotypes have a relatively strong correlation with sterile and low fertile phenotypes. Since this correlation is not so strong, a part of “Dwarf” and “Semi-dwarf” mutants do not affect seed fertility, but other “Dwarf” and “Semi-dwarf” mutants may be regulated by genes associated with some housekeeping functions.

 retrotransposition. We have examined 53 kinds of abnormal phenotypes in rice from the seedling to harvest stages that are easily evaluated in the field. This project has revealed that this population contains a large number of mutants covering a wide range of phenotypes. Although several mutant phenotypes may be environment-sensitive and their expression may be unstable, most of the mutant phenotypes were stable. We also deposited additional information about certain phenotypes in a comment field within the phenotype description table, if this information was provided. A text search box on the phenotype list web page is envisioned to facilitate use of the resource.

 insertions in a common gene, they usually exhibited similar phenotypes. These data are a strong indication of the function of a disrupted gene. However, several phenotypes such as “Dwarf” and “Low fertile” were observed in many lines. It might be difficult to assign a gene function based solely on correlation for these frequently observed phenotypes, and a complementation test would be required to confirm the correlation. If flanking sequence data from all insertion lines can be obtained, this correlation will be more useful for the annotation of genes. We are continuing to sequence the flanking regions of all our mutant lines.
In this study, we collected a large amount of phenotypic data in seven fields under natural conditions. If phenotypes are observed under other conditions such as drought or temperature stress conditions or under pathogen pressure, phenotypic description of this population would be much more enriched. In addition, the present study evaluated only a limited number of traits easily scored on above-ground organs. Thus, other traits such as roots and seed storage composition remain to be investigated in the future. Expansion of this study to include new traits would enable investigators to find new correlations with disrupted genes. Furthermore, integration of phenotype data with those of microarray experiments, metabolic profiling, and other approaches will be a powerful tool for revealing new aspects of plant physiology.
