Purpose
To measure the refractive properties of the healthy human eye during acute hyperglycemia by means of Scheimpflug imaging and Hartmann-Shack aberrometry.

Methods
Acute hyperglycemia was induced in five healthy subjects (two males, three females, mean age ±SD 24.8 years ± 4.6) by means of an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) after subcutaneous somatostatin injection. Before and every 30 minutes after the OGTT, measurements with Scheimpflug imaging and Hartmann-Shack aberrometry were performed. The main outcome measures were the thickness and shape of the lens, and the ocular refractive error and higher order aberrations. The equivalent refractive index of the lens was calculated from these parameters. Measurements at baseline and during hyperglycemia were analyzed by means of Wilcoxon signed rank sum tests.

Results
During hyperglycemia (mean blood glucose level at baseline: 4.0 mmol/l; mean maximal blood glucose level: 18.4 mmol/l) no changes could be found in the refractive properties within the group. In one subject, a hyperopic shift (0.4 D) was observed, together with a more convex shape of the anterior lens surface and a decrease in the equivalent refractive index of the lens.

Conclusions
This study shows that hyperglycemia generally does not cause changes in the refractive properties of the healthy eye. Nevertheless, in one subject a hyperopic shift accompanied by a change in shape and refractive index of the lens was measured. This finding could provide an explanation for the mechanism underlying the refractive changes that are often observed during hyperglycemia.

] induced hyperglycemia in seven healthy, young subjects through somatostatin injections and an oral glucose load. By means of autorefractometry and ultrasound biometry a large change in ocular refraction (-2.0 diopters (D)) and thickness of the lens (1.0 mm) was measured within 150 minutes after administration of the glucose load (maximal hyperglycemia: 13.9 mmol/l). The results of these two studies indicated that induced hyperglycemia can cause changes in refraction and that these changes appeared to be larger in healthy subjects.

Subjects and methods
Five healthy Caucasian subjects (two males and three females) were recruited for this study. Mean age was 24.8 years (SD ±4.6 and range 21.2–32.6) and mean body mass index (BMI) was 24.2 kg/m2 (SD ±3.2 and range 21.4 - 29.7). The Medical Ethics Committee of the VU University Medical Center in Amsterdam approved the study protocol, and written informed consent was obtained from all subjects after the nature of the study had been explained. Subjects with a history of diabetes mellitus (or a fasting plasma glucose >5.5 mmol/l), a BMI of >30 kg/m2, visual acuity of <0.5 (Snellen), or a history of ocular pathology were excluded from the study.
Procedure to induce hyperglycemia
After a 10-hour overnight fast, the subjects received a subcutaneous injection of 100 µg synthetic somatostatin (Sandostatin, Novartis, Basel, Switzerland) in order to suppress the endogenous insulin secretion during glucose loading. Each subject had an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) (glucose 75 g) 30 minutes after the somatostatin injection. Blood glucose levels were measured with a blood glucose analyzer (HemoCue Diagnostics BV, Oisterwijk, the Netherlands). Endogenous insulin levels were determined with immunometric assays (Luminescence, Bayer Diagnostics, Mijdrecht, the Netherlands) in the Laboratory of Endocrinology of the Department of Clinical Chemistry in the VU University Medical Center. The subjects remained in a fasting state during the entire procedure.

It is surprising that a change in refraction and ocular parameters could be determined in only one subject. It must be noted that the procedures for inducing hyperglycemia and monitoring blood glucose were, to some extent, different for subject 1 compared to the other subjects. Because of a delayed elevation in blood glucose level, a second oral glucose load (150 g instead of 75 g glucose) was administered. Nevertheless, the maximum blood glucose value of subject 1 did not exceed that of the other subjects, and the endogenous insulin level was adequately suppressed during the glucose loading. Furthermore, in order to obtain sufficient blood samples, 0.9% saline had to be administered to keep the antecubital vein open. Therefore, it could not be excluded that the administration of saline contributed to the refractive change and alterations in the lens of subject 1. However, no studies have yet reported any refractive change due to saline administration.

] reported that an increase in the higher order aberrations could cause a decrease in visual acuity. However, no changes in the higher order aberrations were found in any of the subjects in our study. Therefore, it can be assumed that blurred vision in hyperglycemia cannot be explained by changes in the higher order aberrations of the eye.
In sum, the results of this study show that induced hyperglycemia generally does not cause changes in the refractive properties of the healthy human eye. However, there were interindividual variations, as illustrated by subject 1, who had a hyperopic shift of refraction and a change in shape and equivalent refractive index of the lens during hyperglycemia. This could provide an explanation for the mechanism underlying the refractive changes often experienced by patients with DM and hyperglycemia.
