 = 1,720), irrespective of the clinical presentation, based on the detection of αS-immunoreactivity (IR) in one of the most vulnerable nuclei; in the dorsal motor nucleus of vagus, substantia nigra and basal forebrain. The frequency of αS-IR lesions in this large cohort was 14% (248 out of 1,720). If applicable, each of the 226 subjects with all required material available was assigned a neuropathological stage/category of PD/DLB and finally the neuropathological data was analyzed in relation to dementia and EPS. 83% of subjects showed a distribution pattern of αS-IR that was compatible with the current staging/categorization systems. Around 55% of subjects with widespread αS pathology (Braak’s PD stages 5–6) lacked clinical signs of dementia or EPS. Similarly, in respect to those subjects that fulfilled the McKeith criteria for diffuse neocortical category and displaying only mild concomitant Alzheimer’s disease-related pathology, only 48% were demented and 54% displayed EPS. It is noteworthy that some subjects (17%) deviated from the suggested caudo-rostral propagation suggesting alternative routes of progression, perhaps due to concomitant diseases and genetic predisposition. In conclusion, our results do indeed confirm that current staging/categorization systems can readily be applied to most of the subjects with αS pathology. However, finding that around half of the subjects with abundant αS pathology remain neurologically intact is intriguing and raises the question whether we do assess the actual disease process.

]. Based on the analysis of the regional distribution of αS-IR inclusions in a cohort including both neurologically unimpaired subjects and patients with PD, a staging system was devised whereby αS pathology was divided into six successive stages. In the central nervous system, the proposed sequence begins in the dorsal motor nucleus of vagus (dmV), and then proceeds with an upward progression via locus coeruleus (LC) (stage 2) to the substantia nigra (SN) (stage 3), and then to the basal foreberain (BFB) and transentorhinal region (stage 4) until it finally reaches the neocortex (stages 5–6).

], it is emphasized that the concomitant pathologies should be taken into account when assessing the causative relationships between pathologies and symptoms. Thus, the most common pathology seen in aged demented individuals, i.e. Alzheimer’s disease (AD)-related pathology, should be evaluated while assessing the likelihood of causation, i.e. that the αS pathology is associated with a DLB clinical syndrome.

]. The frequency of dementia and EPS was assessed in each stage and the likelihood that dementia was due to AD-related pathology or αS pathology was also examined.

]. The initial screening for both dementia and EPS had taken place in a primary health care centre. With respects to dementia, all patients scoring 26 or less in minimental State Examination (MMSE) had been referred to a neurologist for further evaluation and all patients scoring >26 in MMSE but displaying signs of memory impairment had been referred to a CERAD test. Consequently, many subjects had been examined by a neurologist and all had at least visited a general physician (within a maximum of 1 year before death). It is noteworthy that many of the subjects included in this study had been under continuous clinical follow-up due to some chronic disease. Admittedly, some subjects may have developed subtle extrapyramidal signs or mild cognitive impairment between the last clinical examination and death, but it is most unlikely that the presence of moderate or full-blown parkinsonian syndrome/dementia would have been overlooked.

In the nbM and all subcortical regions, αS-IR inclusions were counted unilaterally within entire nuclei and assessed following an arbitrary grading system: in nbM and SN, + =mild (<25 inclusions); ++ = moderate (25–50 inclusions); +++ = severe (>50 inclusions), in LC and dmV, + = mild (1–2 inclusions); ++ = moderate (2–10 inclusion), +++ = severe (>10 inclusions). Several inclusions within one neuron were counted as a single inclusion. The αS-IR structures were designated as being present (+) or not (0) in raphe nucleus and CA2 region of the hippocampus. If no αS-IR inclusions were identified in the sections of medulla, pons, midbrain or BFB, the result was verified in at least 3–4 consecutive sections i.e. the subsequent 5th, 10th, 15th and 20th sections were stained. This was done in order to increase the likelihood of capturing incipient neurons with αS-IR inclusions.


Results
Assessment of clinical data
The 226 αS-positive subjects examined included 114 (50%) patients with a clinical diagnosis of a neurodegenerative disorder, 15 (7%) patients with other neurological disorders and 97 (43%) individuals in whom the clinical information indicated that they had no neurological impairment. The mean age at death was 77 ± 0.6 years, ranging from 44 to 98 years and the gender was rather evenly distributed (108 females/118 males).

Frequency of αS-immunoreactivity in the most vulnerable anatomical regions
The most frequently affected regions in the 226 αS-positive subjects were dmV (197/223) and SN (197/225) where the αS-IR was seen in 88% of the analyzed subjects. The LC was affected in 81% (181/223) of subjects, making this area the second most vulnerable nuclei. The large neurons in the nbM were αS-immunopositive in 78% of cases (171/219), whereas the involvement of AC, particularly the cortico-medial nuclear group, was seen in 73% (162/223) of subjects.

In line with the above, when only demented subjects were included in the analysis the correlation between αS pathology and dementia was close to excellent (85%).

]. It was presumed that this would increase the diagnostic specificity since it was believed that the pathological substrate behind DLB was indeed αS pathology. When we assessed our unique material, we found, that within the neuropathological high likelihood categories of DLB, i.e. those cases where limbic/diffuse neocortical αS pathology is combined with mild/moderate AD-related changes, 56% of subjects remained cognitively intact. However, when we examined only demented subjects without severe AD-related pathology (Braak’s AD stage V-VI), 85% were assigned to a high likelihood category of DLB. This shows that when αS pathology is examined in clinically demented subjects, the correlation received between particular pathologic change and dementia is good. It is noteworthy that with respect of AD-related neurofibrillary pathology, all cases in the neocortical stage (Braak stage V-VI) were indeed demented.
