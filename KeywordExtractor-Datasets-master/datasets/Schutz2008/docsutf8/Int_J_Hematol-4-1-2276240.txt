Invasive fungal infections are frequent and often deadly complications in patients with malignant hematological diseases. Voriconazole is a third generation triazole antifungal with broad activity against most clinically relevant fungal pathogens. Clinical practice often deviates from insights gained from controlled randomized trials. We conducted a multi-centre survey to evaluate efficacy, safety, treatment indications and dosing of voriconazole outside clinical trials. Patients receiving voriconazole were documented via electronic data capturing. An analysis was conducted after submission of 100 episodes from September 2004 to November 2005. Voriconazole was administered for suspected or proven invasive fungal infection (IFI) (57%), as empirical treatment in patients with fever of unknown origin (21%) and secondary (19%) as well as primary (3%) prophylaxis of IFI. Investigators’ assessment of fungal infection often diverted from EORTC/MSG 2002 criteria. A favorable response was reported in 61.4% for suspected or proven IFI and 52.4% for empirical treatment. Mortality was 15%, 26.7% of which was attributable to IFI. Breakthrough fungal infections occurred in four (21.1%) patients with voriconazole as secondary prophylaxis. Toxicity and adverse events comprised elevated liver enzymes and visual disturbances. Although indications frequently deviated from clinical evidence and legal approval, voriconazole showed efficacy and safety, comparable to major controlled clinical trials. Data from this survey demonstrate the difficulty of putting drugs to their approved use in IFI.

Introduction

].
Voriconazole follows itraconazole as the second triazole-antifungal agent with an enhanced spectrum of activity against numerous clinically important fungi. This activity is achieved by inhibition of fungal cytochrome P450-mediated 14α-lanosterol demethylase, a key enzyme in ergosterol biosynthesis. Subsequent loss of ergosterol in the fungal cell wall and accumulation of 14α-methyl sterols are the primary mode of action of voriconazole.

]. These criteria classify IFIs as possible, probable, or proven according to diagnostic test results. Basically, these criteria demand major clinical signs in combination with host factors for a possible diagnosis. For a probable diagnosis, certain microbiological criteria (e.g. serum galactomannan) must be fulfilled, while a proven diagnosis demands histopathological findings or positive culture from a primary sterile site. However, trial results do not always translate into everyday clinical practice. We therefore conducted a multi-centre survey to evaluate efficacy and safety as well as common treatment indications and prescribed dosing of voriconazole outside clinical trials.

Methods
Participating investigators were asked to document all patients receiving voriconazole via online electronic data capture. Data were collected retrospectively after treatment completion. Collected data comprised demographic information, underlying disease, indication for treatment, earlier antifungal treatment, risk factors for invasive fungal infection, clinical outcome (including results of diagnostic imaging, microbiology, lab results, vital signs and survival), occurrence of adverse events, concurrent medication, and evaluation of response. Treatment outcome was evaluated by the investigator. Data were monitored electronically and manually for plausibility and completeness and queries were raised to the investigators in cases that were unclear or incomplete.

]. However, adverse event reporting is naturally less stringent in a survey than in controlled clinical trials.
Analysis of survey data did not reveal yet unknown toxicities of voriconazole. Treatment-related grade 3 or 4 hepatotoxicity was observed in 15 patients. Further frequent adverse events were visual disturbances (6%), rash (3%) and nausea (3%).

]. Thus, a rate of as much as 62% may be considered as off-label use. Furthermore, all randomized controlled clinical trials on voriconazole used the intravenous formulation as initial treatment. Despite this, 39.5% of patients with at least possible IFI were started on oral voriconazole. Looking at these figures, one could claim that only 23% of the patients reported were treated as approved by the German health administration and according to best scientific evidence. But does this mean patients were not treated in their best interest?

]. Additionally, especially in palliative situations, long-term inpatient treatment with intravenous antifungals is often undesirable. Finally, no antifungal has yet been approved for secondary prophylaxis of IPA.
In the above clinical situations, voriconazole offers a flexible and tolerable treatment option. Still, the many difficulties in the diagnosis and treatment of invasive fungal infections should not be used as a carte blanche in clinical decision making. Physicians should strive towards establishing the most accurate diagnosis possible and then treat according to current evidence.
