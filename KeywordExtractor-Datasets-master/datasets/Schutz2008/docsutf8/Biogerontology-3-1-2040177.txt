Results of our study also indicated that the inherited difference in the skeletal aging pattern in men lies mostly in the rate of aging, but in women in the age of the onset of the period of visible skeletal changes.

The aim of our study was to investigate the extent and mode of inheritance of a skeletal biomarker of biological aging (OSS) in a large sample of ethnically homogeneous pedigrees.

Materials and methods
Sample
The population sampled consisted of native Chuvashians residing in numerous small villages in the Chuvashia and Bashkartostan Autonomies of the Russian Federation. The data were gathered in three field studies during August/September of 1994 (555 individuals), May/June of 1999 (715 individuals), and September 2002 (240 individuals) by investigators from the Department of Anatomy and Anthropology, Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University (Israel), and the Institute of Anthropology, Moscow University (Russia). The expeditions were part of a Chuvashia Skeletal Aging Study (ChuSAS) project whose main aim was to investigate the different aspects of skeletal aging within the Chuvashia population. All information collected and measurements taken during all expeditions were done by the same team of investigators. The investigated cohort comprised 359 families and included 787 men aged 18–89 years (mean 46.9) and 723 women aged 18–90 years (mean 48.5).
2003
). In the present study, we collected data from residents of a number of small villages (with a predominant Chuvashian population) located in the Volga region. A rural population is more homogeneous than urban in terms of ethnicity, occupation, and physical activity. The study participants shared similar living, economic, and professional conditions with most individuals employed in agriculture or in other occupations involving physical labor. Data from 80% to 90% of the families (including all family members who were living in the area at the time of the expedition) were obtained. Since almost every individual was related to one of the families, we were able to collect data on up to 90% of the population in each village. Data obtained from self-completed questionnaires and confirmed during the interview included sex, age, age at menarche, age at menopause and occupation. Menopause was defined as >12 months without menstruation. Age at last menstruation was considered as menopausal age. In order to minimize the possible recall bias, the investigators excluded from the analyses all women who had doubts about their age at menarche. The anthropometrical measurements (weight, stature, etc.) were also collected using standard methodology. In the studied sample, there were no individuals with known rheumatoid or psoriatic arthritis or users of steroid medication. Subjects with post-traumatic hand osteoarthritis were excluded from the study. All procedures involved were consensual. The subjects signed an informed consent form, and the entire project was approved by the Helsinki Ethics Committee of Tel-Aviv University.

Statistical and genetic analysis
Prior to any other evaluations, the descriptive statistics reflecting the basic characteristics of the studied sample were computed in the whole sample and within age groups of 5 years.
At the first stage we computed familial (spouses, parent-offspring and sib-sib) correlations between the corresponding TOSS levels to examine the potential genetic effect on the skeletal biomarker of BA.

After age 45 OSS in women was higher, compared with men and the sex difference in the OSS scores increases up to the end of the age range. The OSS variance in age groups increases rapidly up to age 50.

Discussion
In the present study, we evaluated the extent and mode of inheritance of a skeletal biomarker of BA. We constructed this biomarker (TOSS) to be maximally fitted according to the BA definition; it reflects the intensity of an individual’s skeletal changes in relation to its coevals of the same sex, and the range of the index does not depend on the age cohort.

2004
) studied a sample that included 1,402 members of 288 pedigrees from the Framingham Heart Study; the log-transformation was used to reduce the growth of OSS variance with age. A special BA index was constructed by adjusting the individual’s age for log-transformed OSS with cubic polynomial. The log-transformation automatically excludes from the analysis all individuals with zero OSS (note that for ages >30, the zero OSS value is meaningful and denotes a low BA). For the resulting trait, the genetic variance component analysis showed that sex, height, the body mass index, and, in women, menopausal status and estrogen use, jointly explained approximately 6% of the total variance of BA index. Genetic factors explained an additional 57%. The genome search for this BA index revealed a number of potential chromosomal regions in the two-point analysis, but for multipoint, only the region on chromosome 21 remained significant.

Thus, we can conclude that the inherited difference in the aging pattern lies in men, mostly in the rate of aging, but in women, it is in the age of onset of the period of visible changes.
