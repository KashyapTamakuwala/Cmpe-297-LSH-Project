Introduction
Despite vertebral fracture being a significant risk factor for further fracture, vertebral fractures are often unrecognised. A study was therefore conducted to determine the proportion of patients presenting with a non-vertebral fracture who also have an unrecognised vertebral fracture.

Methods
Prospective study of patients presenting with a non-vertebral fracture in South Glasgow who underwent DXA evaluation with vertebral morphometry (MXA) from DV5/6 to LV4/5. Vertebral deformities (consistent with fracture) were identified by direct visualisation using the Genant semi-quantitative grading scale.

However, 19.8% of patients with an osteopenic T-score had a vertebral deformity (48% of which were multiple), and 16.1% of patients with a normal T-score had a vertebral deformity (26.3% of which were multiple). Following non-vertebral fracture, some guidelines suggest that anti-resorptive therapy should be reserved for patients with DXA-proven osteoporosis. However, patients who have one or more prior vertebral fractures (prevalent at the time of their non-vertebral fracture) would also become candidates for anti-resorptive therapy—which would have not been the case had their vertebral fracture status not been known. Overall in this study, 8.9% of patients are likely to have had a change in management by virtue of their underlying vertebral deformity status. In other words, 11 patients who present with a non-vertebral fracture would need to undergo vertebral morphometry in order to identify one patient who ought to be managed differently.

Conclusions
Our results support the recommendation to perform vertebral morphometry in patients who are referred for DXA after experiencing a non-vertebral fracture. Treatment decisions will then better reflect any given patient’s future absolute fracture risk. The 'Number Needed to Screen' if vertebral morphometry is used in this way would be seven to identify one patient with vertebral deformity, and 14 to identify one patient with two or more vertebral deformities. Although carrying out MXA will increase radiation exposure for the patient, this increased exposure is significantly less than would be obtained if X-rays of the dorso-lumbar spine were obtained.

], women with a single pre-existing vertebral fracture, identified in eight studies at baseline by vertebral morphometry and in another seven as clinical (symptomatic) fractures, were 4.4-times more likely to have another vertebral fracture than women without vertebral fracture. Prior vertebral fracture also predicted non-vertebral fracture: in women with vertebral fracture, the risk of hip fracture was increased by 2.3-times, of Colles’ by 1.4-times and of any non-vertebral fracture by 1.8-times. Fracture risk increased even further with each additional vertebral fracture; for example, the odds of a new vertebral fracture in women with five or more prior vertebral fractures were 35-times greater than for women without prior vertebral fracture.
Given that vertebral fracture is a significant risk factor for further fracture, and that vertebral fractures often go undiagnosed, this study set out to determine the proportion of patients attending a Fracture Liaison Service following a non-vertebral fracture who also have an unrecognised vertebral fracture.

]. All patients aged 50 years or over identified by an Osteoporosis Specialist Nurse have a DXA scan carried out if they are likely to be candidates for bisphosphonate therapy. It should be noted that patients aged over 70 years presenting to this service after hip fracture do not have a DXA scan carried out, since most of these patients have osteoporosis and require therapy.

]. All scans were reviewed by and vertebral deformities reported by the same physician (SJG). Although Genant’s semi-quantitative grading is based on analysis of X-rays and is not validated for MXA, it was used in this study to assess vertebral status on MXA since it provides a practical and pragmatic option.

Information regarding risk factors for fracture—including prior history of fracture, early menopause, BMI, history of smoking or excess alcohol, thyrotoxicosis, history of maternal hip fracture, family history of osteoporosis, steroid use, rheumatoid disease, history of recurrent falls and partial gastrectomy—was also collected. Of all patients, 63% had one fracture risk factor, 23% had two risk factors, 11% had three risk factors and 3% had more than three risk factors. Risk fractures for fracture were assessed after patients had presented to the FLS with a non-vertebral fracture; therefore, every patient had a prior history of fracture.

Of the patients with vertebral deformities, 3 (3.6%) had unreadable scans for grading. Of the 80 remaining patients, 58 (72.5%) had Grade 2 or Grade 3 deformities. Thirty-two (55.2%) of the patients with vertebral deformity of Grade 2 and Grade 3 had multiple vertebral fractures. Of the sub-group of patients with vertebral deformity of Grade 2 and 3, 56.9% had deformities in the thoracic spine, 22.4% in the lumbar spine and 20.7% in both regions. There was no significant difference between the vertebral deformity population and the sub-population of patients with Grade 2 or 3 deformities, in terms of the proportion of patients with multiple vertebral deformities or in the site of deformity.

Discussion
One-quarter of patients presenting to our Fracture Liaison Service with a non-vertebral fracture had a previously undiagnosed vertebral deformity, of which almost one-half (45%) were multiple vertebral deformities. This is similar to the prevalence seen in previous studies using radiographic or MXA detection in women with and without non-vertebral fracture. Sub-analysis of patients by grade of deformity revealed that almost three-quarters of the patients had vertebral deformities of Grade 2 and Grade 3. These are more likely to be vertebral fractures, rather than vertebral deformities of non-osteoporosis aetiology, which might be more likely where Grade 1 deformities are present.

]. Identification of those patients who already have an (often unrecognised) prior vertebral fracture is particularly important, as they are at high risk of further fracture by virtue of their prior vertebral fracture. Although these patients might not fulfil the criteria for therapy on the basis of their (non-vertebral) fracture history and BMD, they might be candidates for therapy if their underlying positive vertebral fracture status was known.
In this study, five of the 118 patients with normal BMD (4.2%) had two or more previously undiagnosed vertebral deformities plus a new non-vertebral fracture, and 25 of the 126 patients with osteopenic BMD (19.8%) had one or more previously undiagnosed vertebral deformities plus a non-vertebral fracture. These patients would not have been candidates for anti-resorptive treatment if MXA had not been performed and their vertebral deformities identified. Therefore, one in 20 patients with a normal T-score and almost one in five patients with an osteopenic T-score would experience a change in management by virtue of their underlying vertebral deformity or deformities.
Overall, 30 (8.9%) of the patients in this study would be eligible for treatment by virtue of their newly identified vertebral deformity., which means that 11 patients who present with a non-vertebral fracture would need to undergo vertebral morphometry in order to identify one patient who ought to be managed differently. This ‘Number Needed to Screen’ gives an indication of the number of patients for whom treatment recommendations would change after the identification of vertebral fracture.

]. In this study, 72% of patients presented with their first non-vertebral fracture, and vertebral morphometry subsequently identified vertebral deformities in one in five (21%) of these patients. Nearly one-half of vertebral deformities were multiple (48%). It is highly likely that these vertebral fractures had occurred prior to the first non-vertebral fracture, suggesting that a substantial number of patients will have experienced a vertebral fracture prior to any non-vertebral fracture event.
Our results support the recommendation to perform vertebral morphometry in any patient who is referred for DXA testing after experiencing a non-vertebral fracture. Treatment decisions will then better reflect any given patient’s future absolute fracture risk. The 'Number Needed to Screen' if MXA is used in this way would be seven to identify one patient with vertebral deformity, and 14 to identify one patient with two or more vertebral deformities.
21
],corresponding to an estimated effective dose of about 2.5 μSv. These are relatively small doses compared to the UK natural background radiation level of approximately 2.5 mSv. The small carcinogenic potential associated with these scans has to be balanced against both the prognostic importance (in terms of future fracture risk) that is associated with the identification of unrecognised vertebral deformities and also the much higher radiation exposure risk associated with plain spine radiology (effective dose ∼0.6 mSv).
Lateral vertebral morphometry does have limitations; for example, it is less reliable than conventional lateral spine X-rays at the upper thoracic spine and in Grade 1 deformities.
22
] comparing MXA with lateral spine X-rays found that vertebral morphometry using MXA allowed diagnosis of vertebral fracture in the lumbar and mid thoracic spine, where vertebral fractures are most common. MXA was less reliable at the upper thoracic spine, which is also an established limitation of X-rays.
23
] compared identification of vertebral fracture on MXA using the Genant semi-quantitative method using MXA with conventional X-rays in 80 post-menopausal women. Of the 1,027 potentially evaluable vertebrae, 81% were adequately visualised on MXA to allow grading. Prevalent vertebral fracture was identified in 40 vertebral bodies using X-ray; of these, 28 (70%) were correctly identified on MXA, 17/18 (95%) Grade 2 or 3 and 11/22 (50%) of Grade 1 fractures. Of the non-fractured vertebrae, 96.2% were correctly classified as normal by MXA.

], and was used in this study as a pragmatic option. To carry out quantitative analysis on each scan would have been time-consuming and impractical.
Given that the sample population had already had at least one non-vertebral fracture (28% had more than one prior fracture), were drawn from the FLS population, and that almost three-quarters had Grade 2 or 3 vertebral deformity, it seems reasonable to expect the vertebral deformity to be due to osteoporosis, rather than other diagnoses such as degenerative change or Scheurmann’s disease.
24
]. Plain spine X-rays were not carried out in this study. Furthermore, in keeping with our local protocol, bone densitometry was not carried out in older patients (over the age of 70) after hip fracture. Both of these features may mean that the overall prevalence of vertebral deformity in this population has been underestimated.
In conclusion, undiagnosed vertebral deformity is highly prevalent in patients aged over 50 years who present with a new non-vertebral fracture. Given that prior vertebral fracture significantly increases the risk of further fracture and because newer diagnostic techniques make identification of vertebral deformity consistent with fracture relatively straightforward with minimal radiation exposure, we recommend that all patients undergoing DXA should also undergo vertebral morphometry to identify prior vertebral deformities consistent with fractures.
