For the present study, DNA of 102 spina bifida patients, 116 mothers, 101 fathers, 265 control women and 211 pediatric controls was available for genotyping.

Statistical analyses

Odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were calculated by means of logistic regression analysis.
NOS3
 894G>T SNP on plasma homocysteine and plasma folate concentration was studied by means of linear regression analysis. Since the distributions of plasma homocysteine and plasma folate concentrations are positively skewed, these variables were logarithmically transformed prior to linear regression analysis.
Deviation from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium was calculated to assess the accuracy of the genotyping assay.
