I conducted a review of the published literature to assess the strength of the evidence for an association between prenatal exposure to methylmercury (MeHg) and subsequent child development. I identified 12 studies on this subject published since 1980. Of these, 3 were longitudinal studies—2 conducted in the Seychelle Islands, and 1 in the Faroe Islands. Nine were cross-sectional studies conducted in different countries where seafood, a source of MeHg, constituted a major part of the diet. The ages of the children studied ranged from 2 weeks to 12 years. The results of the longitudinal studies were contradictory. Researchers in the Faroe Islands identified an association between MeHg exposure and developmental effects, whereas those in the Seychelle Islands identified no such association. This inconsistency was mirrored in the results of the cross-sectional studies where there were some positive and some negative findings. It was concluded that it was not possible from currently available data to determine whether there is an association between prenatal MeHg exposure and adverse developmental effects in children. In advance of future research, consideration should be given to resolving the uncertainties surrounding exposure assessment and outcome measurement, as both elements varied between studies. It was suggested that questions of exposure assessment would benefit from the application of an expert review process. Outcome assessment would benefit from the development of theoretically based measures of specific aspects of cognitive functioning to replace the relatively crude measures of attainment and IQ currently employed in most studies. This would assist in the development of classic longitudinal studies by allowing repeated assessment over the full age range and providing data that are more readily interpretable and comparable between studies.

Chipman et al. 1995

). In aquatic environments, mercury is methylated by the action of common bacteria and methylmercury (MeHg), then passes up the food chain and becomes concentrated in fish and sea mammals. The heavy dependence of the Minamata inhabitants on a fish diet meant that they were subject to high levels of MeHg exposure. Both marine and freshwater fish routinely contain low levels of MeHg as a result of mercury leaching from the earth’s crust. Cases of frank poisoning have not been recorded in fish-eating populations other than those in Minamata, where special circumstances prevailed. However, the Minamata findings raised questions about whether less severe neurologic effects might occur at lower levels of exposure in populations whose diets were rich in seafood.
Harada 1995

Hanson 1997
). Any adverse effects are likely to be structurally and functionally different from those seen in the exposed adult. Thus, in addition to the obvious concern for the health of those with diets high in seafood, this issue has wider public health implications in terms of the general advisability of consuming seafood during pregnancy.
The systematic investigation of potential developmental effects in children after prenatal exposure to MeHg began in the 1980s. Since that time two major longitudinal programs of work and a number of smaller cross-sectional studies have been conducted. These investigations assessed levels of prenatal exposure to MeHg in seafood-eating populations and examined subsequent developmental outcomes in children of varying ages. However, despite considerable research effort over a period of 20 years, there remains a lack of consensus on the central issue of whether exposure to MeHg derived from the routine diets of pregnant women presents a risk to their unborn children. This article contributes to the current debate on this subject with a brief description of the currently available data, some possible explanations for the inconclusive results that have so far emerged, and suggestions for potential ways forward in this contentious area of research.

Outcome measurements.
A variety of outcome measures were used that included neurologic examination, developmental rating scales, neuropsychological tests, and attainment tests. Although this variety was accounted for partly by the differing ages of the children, necessitating different forms of assessment, variation also occurred between studies in terms of the tests used for children of the same age group. All studies used tests or rating scales that were established, published assessment tools. With the exception of the Seychelle Islands studies, information on testing procedures provided in the published reports was rather limited and therefore difficult to evaluate. All studies reported control of some potential effect modifiers such as socioeconomic status, ethnicity, and parental IQ, but the particular factors selected for inclusion varied between studies. All studies used multivariate analysis techniques.

 of younger children 38 and 54 months of age reported an interactive effect of MeHg and PCB exposure as an incidental finding that emerged in the course of a study to investigate the adverse effects of PCB exposure. A finding of this nature, although interesting, should perhaps be regarded as speculative only and requiring further investigation.

). However, it should be noted that, given the complex and challenging nature of this type of research, the majority of the cross-sectional studies are also of relatively good quality and would normally be taken into account in a systematic review. The results of these cross-sectional studies in fact mirror the general inconsistency evident in the results of the longitudinal investigations. One is therefore drawn to the conclusion that it is not possible from currently available data to determine whether prenatal exposure to MeHg, at levels routinely experienced by populations whose diets are rich in seafood, results in adverse effects on the nervous system of the developing child.


Discussion

) suggests that further cross-sectional studies employing similar neurobehavioral outcomes will serve only to increase rather than reduce the uncertainty surrounding this issue. In the remainder of this article, therefore, I discuss some of the possible reasons for the inconsistency in the existing data and indicate some areas where alternative approaches might be required to achieve some progress in this field.
The common objective of the investigations reviewed above was to establish whether there is an association between prenatal exposure to MeHg and developmental effects. Although the various studies had many elements in common, perhaps the most noticeable feature of the studies as a group was the variation in the methods used to assess the two basic elements of the association, namely, the exposure and the effect. It is not surprising that research using different combinations of biological and psychological measures produces inconsistent results. The debate surrounding each of these elements, although undoubtedly complex, merits resolution in advance of any further research.
Exposure.
Office of Environmental Health 1999
Annau and Eccles 1986
Trask and Kosofsky 2000
). Both the dose and timing of any environmental insult are important in terms of the specific nature of any adverse effects. How far do our current methods of prenatal exposure assessment reflect the need to take this into account?

) identification of new research required to fill any identified data gaps. In advance of some consensus on these issues, further research is likely to provoke more controversy rather than lead to any resolution of the current uncertainty.

Outcomes.
Koller et al. 2004
Levy et al. 2004
). Results relating to prenatal MeHg exposure represent a particular example of a wider problem and highlight a number of questions related to the more general field of neurobehavioral toxicology.
Spurgeon and Gamberale 1997
Smith 1992
), for example, indicate that in epidemiologic studies this factor should always be controlled. Intuitively it would seem appropriate that the physical testing situation and procedures should be standardized for all subjects as far as is practically possible, regardless of whether firm evidence exists about the influence of heating, lighting, noise control, or the arrangement of furniture. Less well-researched aspects of the test situation can be explored usefully within the researchers’ data. Is there, for example, a significant difference between test scores obtained at the beginning and at the end of the week or at different times of the year?
Harvey et al. 1988
). Similarly some estimation, albeit a subjective rating, of the child’s level of co-operation with the testing procedure is important to include. Potentially this is a major source of variation in test performance rarely alluded to in published reports. Ideally, tests should also include parallel forms or practice trials to ensure that maximal performance level is recorded for each subject.
All except one of the studies in the field of research under discussion here present detailed accounts of quality control procedures in relation to MeHg assessment. It is relatively rare to find equally detailed discussion of procedures for outcome assessment. This is a situation that occurs frequently in neurobehavioral investigations. Lack of reference to quality control does not necessarily imply that control was limited but may suggest something about the attitude of researchers toward its importance. The implications for further research are 2-fold. First, systematic work is needed on the effects of factors considered likely to affect test performance, including both a review of the available data and, if necessary, further investigative work. Second, consensus must be reached on good practice such as that available in some other areas of toxicology, notably animal experimentation. Although this consensus may exist at an informal level in the field, the considerable methodologic variations between different neurobehavioral studies suggest that many aspects are currently opinion based rather than evidence based.
A second and fundamental issue in terms of outcome measures relates to the types of tests used and, by implication, the interpretation of the results they provide and the comparability of these between studies. The tests employed in the studies described above are mainly tests of intellectual functioning. However, those used in different studies, and sometimes within the same study, derive from a number of separate traditions of intellectual assessment, each of which was developed for a different purpose and different client group. Although each has some advantages, none were developed specifically for neurotoxicity research and none is entirely appropriate for this type of application.

). This aspect limits the information that can be derived from the assessment and makes interpretation difficult when conflicting results emerge from different studies. When placed in the context of more recent theoretical developments in cognitive psychology, established IQ tests do not provide results that can be easily linked to current models of cognitive processes.

). At the same time, the pursuit of the goal to achieve comparability over time and between studies has tended to inhibit the development of new techniques. It seems unlikely that consensus on appropriate assessment tools will be achieved in advance of a consensus on the theoretical basis for those tools. Fortunately, much of the information required for these new developments is readily available in the existing cognitive, experimental, and developmental psychology literature.


Conclusion
Reviews of the data relating to the developmental effects of prenatal MeHg exposure have highlighted the inconsistency of the currently available evidence. The size and nature of the risk to children that is associated with seafood consumption by their mothers remains uncertain and a source of considerable controversy. It has been argued here that the present uncertainty derives from the variation between studies in the methods used to measure both the exposure and the effect. Each element would merit further consideration in advance of any future research in this field. Although consensus is required on the appropriate biological marker of exposure, there is also a particular need to address issues of both procedure and content in psychological assessment. Discussion of these issues, particularly those relating to psychological tests, may have implications that go well beyond the immediate needs of this field of inquiry. Investigation of the effects of MeHg provides one particular example of the difficulties in data interpretation that occur repeatedly in neurobehavioral studies and threaten to undermine confidence in this methodology. The increasing international anxiety about potential adverse effects of low-level neurotoxicant exposure in the environment underlines the importance of addressing these concerns, as psychological methods currently represent one of the main tools of research in this field.
