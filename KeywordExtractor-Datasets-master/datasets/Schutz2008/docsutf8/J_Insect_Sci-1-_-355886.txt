), which produces eggs under long-day conditions after adult eclosion. In both sexes of both species, reserves of arylphorin (ArH) were exhausted by the end of metamorphosis. In Cecropia, the same was true for the high-methionine hexamerins, V-MtH and M-MtH. But in short day Monarch females 20–30% of the pupal reserves of V-MtH and M-MtH survived metamorphosis, persisting until long-day conditions were imposed to stimulate egg formation. Differences in storage sites have been documented in other lepidopterans, with MtH reserves being found primarily in fat body protein granules and the ArH reserve being found primarily in the hemolymph. Similar differences could explain how a fraction of the MtH's, but not of ArH, escapes utilization during metamorphosis in a species with post-eclosion egg formation. No differences in utilization schedules were detected between V- and M-MtH, despite divergent compositions and antigenic reactivity.

Materials and Methods
1. Experimental Insects
Hyalophora cecropia
 were stored at 6°C for at least five months and then allowed to initiate adult development by transfer to 25°C. At this temperature development from apolyis to eclosion requires 23 days in females and 21 days in males.
Danaus plexippus
 were captured during mid-October in eastern Tennessee. Most of the catches were sufficiently fresh to suggest recent emergence in nearby regions. They were kept in cages at outdoor temperature and day length, and fed once per day with a 30% honey solution. After two to three weeks under these conditions the ovaries contained only small, translucent follicles, indicating an absence of yolk formation. Their fat bodies, relative to those of freshly caught butterflies, were greatly enlarged and full of lipid droplets.

3. Tissue Preparation
Pan and Telfer, 1990
). It was used in case the smaller amount of tissues collected from this species should prove to require a more sensitive technique for protein quantification, but this proved eventually not to be the case.) Both extraction media contained in addition a protease inhibitor cocktail, Control® (Boehringer Mannheim Biochemical), and 5mM phenylthiourea (PTU). The midgut and, when present, the bursa copulatrix were discarded and the rest of the soft tissues were scraped out of the abdominal cuticle and added to the collected blood. Additional buffer with the protease inhibitor and PTU was added to bring the suspended tissues to a volume that would yield antigen concentrations convenient to measure by the method described below. For Cecropia the final volume was 6 ml per pupa, and 3 or 1.5 ml per adult female and male, respectively. For Monarch pupae the final volume was 3 ml and for adults 0.75 ml. Comparisons between stages were made possible by normalizing to the pupal volume; e. g., concentrations for adult Cecropia females were divided by two and for males by four in order to compare them with the contents of pupal extracts.
The collected samples were stored frozen. For extraction, the tissue mixtures were thawed and transferred to a glass homogenizer. When chorionated eggs were present, they were crushed separately in a ceramic mortar and then combined with the rest of the tissues in the homogenizer.

4. Measurement of Antigen Concentrations

), but when these conditions are satisfied, as they proved to be for hexamerin measurements in Cecropia and Monarchs, it is convenient and reliable.
The measurements are of relative concentrations and are expressed as percentages of the concentration in a standard solution. For the hexamerins, extracts of abdomens from female pupae of each species were used as the standards; for VG, extracts of females containing chorionated eggs were used. The latter included newly eclosed adults in Cecropia and day 7 adults in long day Monarchs.

5. SDS-PAGE Electrophoresis
Insoluble residues that would escape detection by immunodiffusion were monitored by SDS-PAGE. For this purpose 0.1 ml of each of the homogenized samples from a chosen stage were vortexed and pooled. The pooled sample was centrifuged in a microfuge (Beckman®) for 4 min. The lipid cap was removed, and the supernatant decanted. Pellet and supernatant were then separately dissolved in SDS-PAGE sample buffer so that equal volumes contained equal fractions of, respectively, the total pellet and supernatant material in the uncentrifuged pool. The samples were compared in neighboring lanes of pre-cast 4–15% gradient mini gels from Bio-Rad®. Electrophoresis was conducted at constant voltage (100 v), and terminated after 1 hr and 12 min. Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining was used to reveal the banding patterns.

, Vg). They were found in pupal and adult extracts of Cecropia and in extracts of long day Monarch adults, the same samples in which Vg had been detected by immunodiffusion.
Vg is stored as a solute in the hemolymph of female Cecropia pupae and accordingly centrifugal pellets of extracts at that stage did not produce detectable 180 and 40 kDa bands. In adults most Vg has been transferred to the yolk; pellets at this stage produced weak Vg bands due, presumably, to small yolk spheres that are not readily disrupted by homogenization.

2. Hexamerin utilization in females
Cecropia

); and pupal reserves of ArH do not support egg formation in adult Monarchs because they are fully consumed during metamorphosis. When both are at hand, however, both contribute to whatever metamorphic and reproductive functions are under way.

3. Hexamerin synthesis in adults?

), but these occur in males as well as females and are thus not necessarily related to egg formation. Post-eclosion synthesis is not ruled out as a source of V- and M-MtH in adult Monarchs, but if it occurs it is not sufficient to prevent the depletion that accompanies egg formation. It would not, in any case, affect the argument that the consumption of residual pupal V- and M-MtH, rather than ArH, is correlated with post-ecdysial egg formation.

4. V-MtH versus M-MtH
Burmester et al., 1998
). But we are as yet left with no clue as to why natural selection has favored a pair of diverging MtH's over a single protein that might have averaged their amino acid compositions.

A practical consequence of this partial identity is that separate standard curves must be used for each species in measuring V-MtH changes with Oudin test.
