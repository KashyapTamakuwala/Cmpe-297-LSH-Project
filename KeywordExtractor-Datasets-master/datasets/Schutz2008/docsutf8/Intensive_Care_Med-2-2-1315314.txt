Objective
Risk adjustment systems now in use were developed more than a decade ago and lack prognostic performance. Objective of the SAPS 3 study was to collect data about risk factors and outcomes in a heterogeneous cohort of intensive care unit (ICU) patients, in order to develop a new, improved model for risk adjustment.

Design
Prospective multicentre, multinational cohort study.

Patients and setting
A total of 19,577 patients consecutively admitted to 307 ICUs from 14 October to 15 December 2002.

Measurements and results
.


Conclusions
The SAPS 3 study was able to provide a high-quality multinational database, reflecting heterogeneity of current ICU case-mix and typology. The poor performance of SAPS II in this cohort underscores the need for development of a new risk adjustment system for critically ill patients.

] also distort performance results.
If recalibration is not sufficient to improve the performance of the prognostic model, the only alternative is to develop a new model that takes into account the results of studies done since the original model was developed. This means incorporating missing variables that have been shown to affect outcome, minimizing problems with the application of the model, and reducing the possibility of other confounders.
The objective of the SAPS 3 project was to cope with the above-stated problems by developing a new model for improved risk adjustment in critically ill patients. Another important goal was to make the new model available free of charge for use in the scientific community.
In the SAPS 3 study (which took place at the end of 2002), data about risk factors and outcomes in an international multicentric cohort of critically ill patients were prospectively collected so that a high-quality database would be available for further analysis of the associations between risks and outcomes in our patients.

Project Organization

) and conducted in cooperation with the Section on Health Services Research and Outcome of the ESICM. The SAPS 3 Outcomes Research Group consists of a project coordinator and a steering group. The steering group was responsible for the scientific conduct and consistency of the project. An additional advisory board integrated further scientists with special expertise who were asked for comments on the scientific content and for help in conducting the project. The complete board lists can be found in Appendix D of the Electronic Supplementary Material (ESM).
During the data collection phase, a coordination and communications centre (CCC) was installed. The CCC was responsible for the management and control of the project. This included the administration of all project tasks and implementation of actions and activities as necessary; communication between project partners (e.g., centres, researchers and institutions) through sampling and distribution of necessary information; and pooling and administration of the data provided by project participants. In addition, the CCC provided almost around-the-clock service to answer urgent questions and resolve problems during the phase of data collection.
In each country, a country coordinator was responsible for operational management and direct communication with the participating ICUs in that country, including giving specific help when necessary. The country coordinator was responsible for ensuring completion of the various tasks required of the participating ICUs. The list of country coordinators can be found in Appendix E of the ESM.
At the ICU level, an ICU coordinator was responsible for local activities, such as obtaining approval from the local ethics or data-protection committees where applicable. In addition, the ICU coordinator was responsible for supervising the daily data collection, problem management, controlling the completeness of the data, data quality control, training medical and nonmedical staff for data collection, management of the data, and transmission of the data to the CCC or country coordinator. The list of ICU coordinators can be found in Appendix F of the ESM.

n
=26 ICUs). Patient data were then entered into the SAPS 3 stand-alone software system and thus checked for plausibility. In cases of uncertainty, ICU coordinators were contacted for clarification.
In addition, each ICU received a questionnaire with detailed questions about ICU structures and about resources available in other areas of the hospital.
Data were collected at ICU admission, on days 1, 2 and 3, and on the last day of the ICU stay. Data from the day of admission (aside from sociodemographic data such as age and sex) were categorized into different levels: (i) data about the condition of the patient before ICU admission, such as chronic conditions and medical diseases; (ii) data about the patient’s condition at ICU admission, such as the reason for admission, infection at admission, and surgical status; and (iii) data about the patient’s physiologic derangement at ICU admission. These data were collected within an hour before or after ICU admission.

All patients were subjected to mandatory follow-up until hospital discharge, but not longer than 90 days after ICU admission. Patients still remaining in the hospital at 90 days were at that time classified as being “still in the hospital”.

) provided all necessary information. In addition, the CCC was available to answer questions by email, fax and phone. Data were to be collected from all consecutively admitted patients between 14 October and 15 December 2002. ICUs with a high number of beds (and thus also admissions) could stop patient enrolment after contributing 100 patients.

Database
Data were collected and pooled by the CCC. The final database file was then imported into the SAS system, Version 8e (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, USA). Data cleaning was accomplished through the application of a variety of additional plausibility controls and cross-checking of information between redundant data fields.

Because the study was an observational study and no additional interventions were performed, the need for informed consent was waived by the institutional review board. Each ICU, however, was made responsible for obtaining local permissions as necessary.

Data quality
Recorded data were evaluated for completeness of the documentation and reliability. Interrater quality control was performed through rescoring of the data from day 0 (the day of ICU admission) for three randomly selected patients in each ICU. From the rescored data, kappa coefficients and intra-class correlation coefficients were calculated, as appropriate. Availability of the variables necessary to calculate the SAPS II was used as an indicator for the completeness of the data.

Results
Data quality
Four hundred eighty-three rescored patients could be identified and linked to their original counterparts (2.5% of admitted patients). Data quality was found to be excellent, with the majority of coefficients being >0.85. Only two of the more than 50 tested variables had coefficients <0.80 (body weight, 0.79; positive end-expiratory pressure, 0.72), and only one was <0.70 (leukocytes [maximum], 0.57). For a detailed list of coefficients see Table E1 in the ESM. Data completeness was also found to be satisfactory, with 1 [0–3] SAPS II parameter missing per patient.

Description of ICUs
The Basic SAPS 3 cohort includes 307 ICUs from 35 countries. On average each ICU contributed 50 (27–78) patients to the cohort. To assess heterogeneity of results between different geographic regions, seven regions were defined: Australasia, Central and South America, Central and Western Europe, Eastern Europe, North America, Northern Europe, and Southern Europe and Mediterranean countries. The allocation of countries to these regions can be seen from Table E10 of the ESM.

=258) reported having a full-time medical director, and 272 (88.6%) reported having a full-time nursing director. On weekdays, 76.6% of ICUs reported having an intensivist available on the ICU 24 hours per day, whereas 6.2% had an intensivist available in the hospital. In 12.1% of ICUs, the intensivist was at home, on-call, during the daytime. During weekends, this proportion did not change much (74.3%, 5.5%, and 15.0% on the ICU, in the hospital, and on-call, respectively). None of the participating ICUs reported having no intensivists available during night or weekend shifts.

Cardiovascular, respiratory and neurologic diseases were the most frequent organ-specific reasons for admission (Table E4, ESM). The acute medical diseases necessitating ICU admission included a broad spectrum of diagnoses (Table E5, ESM). Approximately one half of the patients underwent surgery before ICU admission, with abdominal, cardiac and vascular surgery being the most frequent procedures (Table E6, ESM).

; see also Table E10 in the ESM). Partitioning of the sample was done to adjust for some of the above-stated differences between different populations and to develop a system that uses several different reference lines to compare ICUs on a similar level. Thus, patients are not necessarily representative of their respective regions.

We did, however, experience problems with the cohort of rescored patients: First, we had to exclude all rescored patients for whom the original counterpart was also excluded due to the application of any of the exclusion criteria. Second, in some cases the original patient identification was either missing or documented in such a way that a unique allocation was not possible. Both of these exclusions reduced the number of rescored patients available for analysis.
Two strategies to build up a cohort are available: first, to recruit only patients who meet well-documented inclusion criteria (such as documented vital status at hospital discharge) or, second, to document all patients and then exclude patients based on a predefined set of exclusion criteria. For the SAPS 3 study we chose the second option—to form two different cohorts—because we needed to provide a basic cohort for all further analyses of the SAPS 3 database. Since some studies will focus on different outcomes (e.g., ICU outcome rather than hospital outcome), we decided to use missing ICU outcome (and not hospital outcome) as an exclusion criterion for the basic cohort.

We conclude that the SAPS 3 database is within the above discussed limits of high quality and reflects the heterogeneity of current intensive care provision. As such, it provides an excellent basis for the development of a new risk adjustment system.
