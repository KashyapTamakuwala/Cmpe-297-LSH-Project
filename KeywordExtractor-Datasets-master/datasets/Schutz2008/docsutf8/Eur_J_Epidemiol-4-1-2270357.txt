There is growing concern in the scientific community that many published scientific findings may represent spurious patterns that are not reproducible in independent data sets. A reason for this is that significance levels or confidence intervals are often applied to secondary variables or sub-samples within the trial, in addition to the primary hypotheses (multiple hypotheses). This problem is likely to be extensive for population-based surveys, in which epidemiological hypotheses are derived after seeing the data set (hypothesis fishing). We recommend a data-splitting procedure to counteract this methodological problem, in which one part of the data set is used for identifying hypotheses, and the other is used for hypothesis testing. The procedure is similar to two-stage analysis of microarray data. We illustrate the process using a real data set related to predictors of low back pain at 14-year follow-up in a population initially free of low back pain. “Widespreadness” of pain (pain reported in several other places than the low back) was a statistically significant predictor, while smoking was not, despite its strong association with low back pain in the first half of the data set. We argue that the application of data splitting, in which an independent party handles the data set, will achieve for epidemiological surveys what pre-registration has done for clinical studies.

 a Type I error, so 5% significance does not imply that the conclusion is correct with a 95% probability. Such statements are meaningful only in a Bayesian context where one assigns a priori probabilities to hypotheses. The present article addresses non-Bayesian (frequentist) analysis, which is by far the most common in epidemiology.

 has also been used, but the meaning of this has shifted toward discovery of valid patterns in databases.) Also, the investigator may run different statistical tests (e.g. parametric and non-parametric tests) for any given hypothesis, which is a less recognized form of hypothesis fishing.

], we contend this method is rarely applied. The limited use of Bonferroni correction may result from uncertainty surrounding the exact number of hypotheses “fished for,” but some researchers may also be motivated to keep the “catch.” In epidemiological research, upwards of 100 possible hypotheses are common, and setting the alpha at 0.0005 eliminates much of the fun in a fishing expedition. As a consequence, researchers may be tempted to discuss only a handful of “significant” results, failing to mention the 95 that proved non-significant.
P
-values almost completely meaningless, and we consider it to be a serious problem for epidemiological survey analysis. The present paper recommends a very simple countermeasure against hypothesis fishing, based on data splitting. The procedure is similar to two-stage analysis of microarray data. We argue that if our method could be applied for survey data in general, it could do for epidemiological studies what pre-experiment registration of RCTs has done for medical experiments.
The rest of the article is laid out as follows: First we review some mathematical methods that might be considered useful for counteracting hypothesis fishing. Then we explain our method in detail, and compare it to two-stage analysis of microarray data, followed by a case study where the method is applied to an analysis of low back pain. The article ends with discussion and conclusion.

Mathematical remedies (that fail to solve the problem)
If one considers hypotheses fishing to be a mathematical problem, it is reasonable to look for mathematical solutions. There is a large mathematical literature that relates to model building and multiple hypotheses, and we will only try to point out the main themes.

], which is a way of controlling the expected percentage of rejected null-hypotheses (discoveries) that are falsely rejected. If all the null-hypotheses are true, FDR is equivalent to Bonferroni correction, but otherwise it is less strict. As we mentioned in the introduction, it can be hard to keep track of the number of hypotheses one is really addressing, which makes the use of Bonferroni or FDR cumbersome.

] has analysed various data splitting approaches similar to the one we apply, and compares them to mathematical inference adjustment methods. Based on his simulation study, he concluded that data splitting costs more in reduced accuracy than it gains in “honesty”. This conclusion is to be expected, because adjustment methods utilize information that the splitting methods disregard. In our present setting, however, accurate information on modelling procedure is not available, so adjustment methods are not an option.

cross validation
leave-one-out cross validation
).
We mention these methods mainly to point out that they are not very relevant for controlling hypotheses fishing. The use of information criteria or cross validation helps in trading model fit for model size, but does not produce adjustments for the total number of variables. The cross validation procedure of splitting the data set, using one part to estimate model parameters and the other for validation is deceptively similar to the method we apply. But the purpose of validating a model’s predictions is entirely different from our purpose of conducting sound hypothesis testing.
P
-values lose their meaning when the hypotheses are chosen from a large pool of undocumented ones. Others may be vaguely aware of the problem, but choose not to address it unless reviewers demand it. Reviewers, on the other hand, may not feel inclined to insist on purity beyond what they have done in their own scientific work.

The solution: data splitting

-values from Parts 1 and 2, but this is not allowed. Because the data in Part 1 was used to construct the hypotheses, it is tainted, and cannot take any part in the hypotheses testing.
statistical significance
. Once a significant finding is established, though, it is preferable to obtain the most accurate parameter estimates possible.
Models: hypothesis variables, and confounders
Epidemiological hypotheses are usually formulated within the framework of a model. Assume the hypothesis is that eating mushrooms increases the risk of cancer. To test this hypothesis, one would build a model with predictors like age, gender, smoking status, as well as mushroom habits, in order to control for these confounding factors. (If old people eat more mushrooms, excluding age from the model would give an incorrect positive association between mushroom eating and cancer.)
From a purely computational point of view, no differences exist between predictors associated with hypotheses and confounders, yet the semantics are very different. The confounders are included only as a means of estimating the causal link between the cause (mushrooms) and its hypothesized effect (cancer).
P
P
-value below 0.1 or 0.2. Despite this rationale for including a confounding factor, no similar demands are made for inclusion of the confounder in Part 2. The chosen set of confounders provides the framework within which the hypothesis is defined, and it is not the framework that is being tested. In the mushroom example, the hypothesis is that mushroom eating is associated with cancer when controlling for age, gender, and smoking, not that controlling for each of these factors is necessary.

Size of Part 1 and Part 2
When deciding upon the relative size of Parts 1 and 2, a trade-off exists between the need to identify hypotheses by exploration in Part 1, and the need to achieve statistical significance in Part 2. An even split may be reasonable in cases where the need for exploration is high, particularly if the data set is large, so that half of the data set is sufficient to achieve statistical significance for stronger effects. In cases where greater domain knowledge is available based on the existing literature, a smaller Part 1 is reasonable, especially when the sample size is small.

Multiple hypotheses
It is possible to investigate multiple hypotheses within our splitting regime, using Bonferroni corrections. Assume, in the mushroom-cancer example, that the analysis of Part 1 also provided strong support for the hypothesis that eating bananas protects against cancer. One might then choose to include both mushroom habits and banana habits as hypothesis variables, and consequently divide alpha by 2 (the number of hypotheses). If either mushroom or banana habit fails the significance test in Part 2, it will still be in the model, as a confounder.
P
-values that fall between alpha/2 and alpha. In this situation, both hypotheses would have passed the significance test individually, but the choice to include two hypotheses resulted in failure of both variables to reach significance. Many non-statisticians would argue that scientific procedures and statistical analysis should be objective, with conclusions based on ‘hard facts’, independent of arbitrary choices of hypotheses. Unfortunately, this is not the case if we wish to claim statistical significance.
The mushroom-banana example is a clear case in which investigators should reduce the alpha-level to account for multiple hypotheses. At the other extreme, if independent research groups investigating different research questions based on independent data sets, their combined effort is obviously not a case of ‘multiple hypothesis testing’. A grey area exists with partially overlapping data sets, hypotheses, and research groups, often making it difficult to decide whether Bonferroni corrections are called for. A pragmatic solution may be to view a published article as a unit, and apply Bonferroni corrections within each one.

Relation to two-stage analysis in genetics
7
].
There are a few differences, however. In a microarray context the set of possible hypotheses is given by the number of genes, and the FDR method is normally used to limit the number of incorrect findings. Rather than primarily counteracting hypothesis fishing, microarray two-stage analysis is usually motivated by cost effectiveness: By screening out promising candidates first, and then evaluating them, researchers can make a higher number of valuable discoveries for each monetary unit spent. In a microarray setting the procedure is also likely to be more automatic, as interesting genes are filtered out in two more or less mechanical steps of analysis. In our epidemiological application, on the other hand, there will be a man-in-the-loop, as the researcher builds a model with hypothesis variables and confounders based on a combination of his domain knowledge and Part 1 of the data.

], which is a self-report questionnaire frequently used in Scandinavian epidemiological studies.

Independent variables (potential risk factors)
In 1990, the survey questionnaire contained a number of socio-demographic and health-related factors, which could be included as risk factors in the present study. Socio-demographic variables were gender, age, marital status, and work status. Health-related variables were body mass index (BMI), smoking status, number of MSP sites other than the low back, duration of previous MSP, use of medication due to MSP, having been examined by a health care provider due to MSP during the last year, comorbidity, family history of musculoskeletal problems, emotional distress, leisure physical activity, participation in competitive sports, sleeping problems, and self-perceived health.

Model and hypotheses

]. Specifically, respondents reported whether they had experienced any pain or discomfort from the following 10 areas during the previous year: head, neck, shoulder, elbow, hand/wrist, upper back, low back, hip, knee and ankle/foot (responses were “yes/no”). The total number of pain sites was computed and categorized into the following four categories: no pain sites, 1 or 2 sites, 3 or 4 sites, and 5 or more pain sites.

.
We hypothesized that smoking would be positively associated with LBP. Therefore, a 1-tailed hypothesis test was conducted. It was also hypothesized that individual pain sites would be positively associated with LBP. To limit the number of hypotheses, though, we hypothesized that the total number of pain sites would affect LBP probability, rather than run analyses for each level of the variable.

Discussion
P
-value for smoking status was 0.040, so the traditional way of analysing epidemiological data would have given a different conclusion.
In this study, the investigators had free access to the entire data set prior to data splitting and during model development. However, any temptation to “peak” at the material was successfully avoided, as indicated by the discrepant results for smoking status. This indicates that the data splitting procedure can indeed function properly in the absence of strict external control of the data. Nevertheless, we recommend that the data set be handled by an independent party, so that researchers can document claims that only Part 1 of the data set was used for model and hypothesis development.
Ideally, the establishment of an independent international body is recommended to manage splitting of survey data. A fixed date for releasing data for Part 2 would be agreed upon, so that only those hypotheses specified prior to the release date would undergo a true significance test. Although several challenges and practical issues would inevitably need resolution (i.e., data collection, confidentiality, release of data), such an organization should be feasible and acceptable to the scientific community.

Conclusions
Results demonstrated that the number of musculoskeletal pain sites significantly predicts low back pain at a 14-year follow-up, when controlling for age, gender, marital status, and smoking. The application of the data splitting method in our study indicates its potential as an effective and useful method to counteract hypothesis fishing in population surveys. In our opinion, systematic data splitting administered by an independent party would accomplish for statistical surveys what pre-registration has already done for clinical trials.
