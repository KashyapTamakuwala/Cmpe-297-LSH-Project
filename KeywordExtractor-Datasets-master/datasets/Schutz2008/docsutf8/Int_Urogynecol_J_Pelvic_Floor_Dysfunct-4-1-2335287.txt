The study aimed to evaluate urogenital symptoms, defecatory symptoms and quality of life before and after a sacrospinous hysteropexy for uterovaginal prolapse. Seventy-two women with symptomatic uterovaginal prolapse were treated with sacrospinous hysteropexy. Before and after surgery, urogenital and defecatory symptoms and quality of life were assessed with a validated questionnaire. Anatomical outcome was assessed by means of pelvic examination before and after surgery. The mean follow-up time was 12.7 months. Scores on all domains of urogenital symptoms and defecatory symptoms, except for the pain and fecal incontinence domain, improved significantly. Also, quality of life improved on all domains. No major complications were encountered.

]. The main objective of this study was to assess urogenital and defecatory symptoms and quality of life before and after sacrospinous hysteropexy. Secondary, we assessed anatomical outcome.

Materials and methods
Patients
In the period between December 2001 and April 2005, 72 women underwent a sacrospinous hysteropexy at the University Medical Center Utrecht, The Netherlands.
A woman was eligible for participation if she had a symptomatic pelvic organ prolapse and wanted surgical correction with preservation of the uterus. Exclusion criteria were abnormal uterus or ovaries on ultrasound examination, abnormal bleeding pattern and abnormal cervical cytology. All women answered a standardized questionnaire covering urogenital symptoms, defecatory symptoms and quality of life before and after surgery. Urodynamic assessment was performed in all women preoperatively. We did not try to diagnose occult stress incontinence. The study was approved by the local ethics committee.

Surgery
12
]. All women received peri-operative thrombosis prophylaxis (anti-Xa) and a single dose of intravenous prophylactic antibiotic (amoxicillin/clavunalic acid). Post-operatively, a 14-French Foley indwelling bladder catheter with a 5-ml balloon was placed in all women and removed after 1 day (in case of an additional anterior colporrhaphy after 3 days).

Measurements

]. In this validation study on a large population-based sample, it was shown that the domain construction of the Dutch version was different from the original one. The following five domains were identified: urinary incontinence, overactive bladder, pain, obstructive micturition and prolapse. The scores of these domains vary between 0 and 100. A high score on a particular domain indicates more bothersome symptoms. The incidence of urinary incontinence before surgery was measured as follows: a woman was considered to have stress urinary incontinence if she replied positively to the question “Do you experience urinary leakage related to physical activity, coughing or sneezing?”. Urge urinary incontinence was scored if the question, “do you experience urinary leakage related to the feeling of urgency?” was answered positively.

Effect sizes were measured as a useful way to estimate whether an improvement on a particular domain was considered to have a small, moderate or large clinical relevance.

During the follow-up period, a total of 16 women (22.2%) had a recurrent prolapse of one of the compartments. Five women (6.9%) had a recurrent prolapse of the uterus (four women stage 2, one woman stage 3). Ten women (13.9%) had a cystocele stage 2 or more (eight women stage 2, two women stage 3) and two women (2.8%) had a prolapse of the posterior compartment stage 2. All the women with a recurrent cystocele had had surgery of the anterior compartment combined with the hysteropexy, so there were no de novo cystoceles. The two women with a recurrent rectocele did not have surgery of the posterior compartment combined with the sacrospinous hysteropexy, so these can be considered as de novo rectoceles.

Discussion
The objective of this study was to assess quality of life and urogenital and defecatory symptoms before and after sacrospinous hysteropexy. The results show that a sacrospinous hysteropexy significantly reduced all urogenital and several defecatory symptoms and significantly improved quality of life. Effect sizes were large on domain genital prolapse and pain (UDI), and on domain physical functioning and emotional health (IIQ). It also anatomically cured the uterine descent in 93.1% of women.

]. Objective cure rates varied between 67 and 96.8%, and subjective cure rates varied between 70 and 98%. Our findings are in line with these results, although the review focused on the sacrospinous fixation of a vault prolapse. Subjective outcomes are underreported in most studies on the sacrospinous ligament fixation. We have shown prospectively that bladder and bowel function improves significantly after a sacrospinous hysteropexy.

]. This lack of a clear correlation between the site of the pelvic organ prolapse and symptomatology makes it very difficult in combination surgery to contribute functional improvement to a certain intervention. All we can conclude from our results is that surgical procedures that involve a sacrospinous hysteropexy show good functional outcome.

The strength of our study is that we measured urogenital and defecatory symptoms and quality of life in a large group of women who underwent a sacrospinous hysteropexy, with a validated questionnaire before and after surgery. There are some potential drawbacks that need to be discussed. First, there might be an indication bias. In our country, a vaginal hysterectomy is the standard surgical technique for correcting a uterine descent. Therefore, women that came to our hospital may have chosen specifically for this operation. They might have had high expectations of this procedure which could have influenced their outcome with respect to quality of life. Second, in some patients, follow-up time was limited to 3 months. Possibly, some recurrences had not yet developed at that time. Third, the study was performed in a single university hospital. The sacrospinous ligament fixation has become rapidly popular in our center and is performed by two surgeons. They are highly trained in performing the procedure. This might have influenced the outcome. Fourth, we did not compare the sacrospinous hysteropexy with another surgical technique to correct a uterine descent. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the sacrospinous hysteropexy is superior to other procedures. However, it is a safe and effective operation for women who wish to preserve their uterus at time of genital prolapse surgery.
