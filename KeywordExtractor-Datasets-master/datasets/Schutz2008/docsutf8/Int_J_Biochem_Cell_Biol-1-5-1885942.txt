Abstract
Freshly isolated hepatocytes rapidly lose their differentiated properties when placed in culture. Therefore, production of a simple culture system for maintaining the phenotype of hepatocytes in culture would greatly facilitate their study. Our aim was to identify conditions that could maintain the differentiated properties of hepatocytes for up to 28 days of culture. Adult rat hepatocytes were isolated and attached in Williams’ medium E containing 10% serum. The medium was changed to either fresh Williams’ medium E or keratinocyte serum-free medium supplemented with dexamethasone, epidermal growth factor and pituitary gland extract. The hepatic phenotype was then analysed using RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry, Western blotting and assays of liver function. Cells cultured in keratinocyte serum-free medium supplemented with dexamethasone, epidermal growth factor and pituitary gland extract maintained their phenotype for 3–4 weeks, based on expression of liver proteins, ureagensis and response to xenobiotics. In contrast, hepatocytes cultured in Williams’ medium E rapidly lost the expression of liver proteins after 3 days. Cells cultured in keratinocyte serum-free medium supplemented with dexamethasone, epidermal growth factor and pituitary gland extract maintained their expression of liver-enriched transcription factors (C/EBPα and β, HNF4α and RXRα) while expression was either lost or reduced in cells cultured in Williams’ medium E. These results suggest that keratinocyte serum-free medium supplemented with dexamethasone, epidermal growth factor and pituitary gland extract can maintain the hepatic phenotype for a prolonged period and that this is probably related to the continued expression of the liver-enriched transcription factors.

In the present study we have introduced a new medium for the long-term culture of differentiated hepatocytes. This is keratinocyte serum-free medium (KSFM). It was tested both alone, and in combination with supplements (dexamethasone, EGF and pituitary gland extract), in comparison with the standard Williams’ medium E, and was used to maintain rat hepatocytes in culture for up to 28 days. We performed immunohistochemical, Western blotting and RT-PCR analysis of the cells under the different culture conditions. We chose hepatic markers which are known to be either rapidly switched off after hepatocyte isolation or are important for detoxification. Expression of a particular gene or protein is normally taken as an indication of intact liver function. However, it is difficult to know simply from expression of a gene or protein that the associated function remains intact. For this reason we also assayed for hepatocyte ureagenesis, glycogen synthesis and response to xenobiotics. Lastly, to gain some mechanistic insight we determined the expression of several liver-enriched transcription factors. Our results suggest that KSFM, in combination with dexamethasone, EGF and pituitary gland extract can maintain the liver phenotype for between 21 and 28 days and it is likely that the ability to do this depends on the sustained expression of liver-enriched transcription factors.

The following conditions were used for the amplification of PCR products: denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s; amplification at 58 °C for 5 s followed by 72 °C for 20 s for 40–50 cycles; cool-down at 40 °C for 2 min. The fluorescence signal was detected at the same time point of each cycle. Data were presented as the normalised ratio, which is the target/reference ratio of the sample divided by the target/reference ratio of the calibrator by Lightcycler Relative Quantification software.

2.6
Periodic acid–Schiff's (PAS) staining
PAS staining was performed to detect glycogen. The cells were seeded onto coverslips and cultured for up to 4 weeks in KDS medium. The cells were then incubated with KDS plus 25 mM glucose for 24 h, fixed with 4% PFA and then permeabilised with 1% Triton X-100 at room temperature for 20–25 min. The cells were washed with tap water for 1–2 min and transferred to 1% periodic acid solution for 30 min. Next, the cells were washed with running tap water for 3 min and then incubated in the Schiff's reagent at room temperature for 30 min to develop. After washing in running tap water for 10 min, the slides were mounted in Gel/Mount mounting medium.

). Briefly, 100 μl of urea standards (0–50 μg/ml) and culture media collected over 24 h were incubated with 300 μl urease buffered solution (Sigma) at room temperature for 20 min. 600 μl of phenol nitroprusside, 600 μl of alkaline hypochlorite (both from Sigma) and 3 ml distilled water were then added, gently mixed and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The absorbance of standards and samples were then measured at an optical density (OD) of 630 nm. Urea production was expressed as the amount accumulated in 24 h per culture dish (μg/dish/day).

The urea production from the hydrolysis of arginine by arginase was taken as a proportional representation of endogenous arginase activity in the arginase assay experiments. The results were normalised with total cellular protein and shown as the amount of urea produced per mg protein per day (μg urea production/mg total protein/day).

Image collection
Fluorescent images were collected using a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope and figures compiled using Adobe Photoshop 7.0. For cell counting and PAS staining experiments, numbers of random fields were selected using the 40× objective lens of a Leica DMRB microscope. The cell numbers were visualised by 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining. Coverslips were incubated with DAPI (500 ng/ml) in PBS for 30 min at room temperature before being mounted on to slides in Gel/Mount mounting medium.

However, we could not maintain the cells for more than 4–5 days, either with one or both the supplements. This result suggests that the KSFM medium itself must contribute to the maintenance of the hepatic phenotype, and it is not just an effect of supplements.

When we examined the expression of the liver-enriched transcription factors we found that C/EBPα and β, HNF4α and RXRα expression were reduced within 3 days of culture with Williams’ medium E but were maintained when the cells were cultured in KDS. This observation suggests that loss of liver-enriched transcription factors is probably the cause of the loss of the differentiated hepatic phenotype.

 than hepatoma cell lines, but they also provide a cheaper alternative and a more controllable system than the intact animal. The method may also have potential for reducing the number of animals used for this type of work. Finally, we believe that this long-term differentiated culture method could also pave the way for bioengineering applications such as the development of a bioartificial liver.

. (B) Immunostaining of liver proteins in rat hepatocytes. Images in (A) and (B) were collected under the same conditions using a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope. (C) Western blotting analysis showing either the differential expression of albumin, transferrin or HNF4α in 72 h cultured rat hepatocytes or the expression of transferrin after 72 h of culture in WDS, WDE or WDP media. (D) Comparison of vimentin expression in WS or KS cultured rat hepatocytes after 72 h. Scale bars are 20 μm.



Fig. 2
Connexin 32 expression in isolated rat hepatocytes. The expression of connexin 32 protein was detected in gap-junction-like arrays (arrows) in hepatocytes cultured with KS and KDS conditions but not Williams’ medium E after 72 h. Two examples of KS and KDS cultures are shown. Scale bars are 20 μm.

Pre and Post in (A) and (B) represent the mRNAs or proteins extracted from normal liver or freshly isolated hepatocytes, respectively. (C and D) Immunostaining analysis of liver proteins (Apolipoprotein B, transferrin, Cx32, C/EBPα, RXRα and HNF4α and UGT following 3 weeks (C) or 4 weeks (D) of culture under KDS conditions. Scale bar = 20 μm.

Phenobarbital-induced expression of liver metabolising enzymes. (A) Expression of CAR and PXR mRNA in KDS-treated rat hepatocytes. Cells were cultured for the times shown. Pre and Post represent the mRNAs extracted from normal liver or freshly isolated hepatocytes, respectively. (B) Hepatocytes were cultured with KDS for 7 or 14 days and then the medium was changed to KDS supplemented with and without 10 μM phenobarbital for another 3 days. The expression of UGT, Cyp2B12, Cyp3A1 and Cyp7A1 was performed by real-time RT-PCR. The results were displayed as the ratio of (Conc. [target gene (treated)]/Conc. [reference gene (treated)]):(Conc. [target gene (untreated)]/Conc. [reference gene (untreated)]). The calibrator is the mRNA from adult rat liver.
