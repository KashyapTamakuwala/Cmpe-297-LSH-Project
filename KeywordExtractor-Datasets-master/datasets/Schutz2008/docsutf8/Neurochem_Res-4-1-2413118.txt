 cells. Our data show that TH activity and DA biosynthesis were enhanced by down-regulation of α-synuclein, suggesting that α-synuclein may act as a negative regulator of cytosolic DA. With respect to PD pathology, a loss of functional α-synuclein may result in increased DA levels in neurons that may lead to cell injury or even death.

]. The high specificity, efficiency and convenience of this technique means that it is a powerful tool for studying gene function.
In the present study, we silenced the expression of α-synuclein using vector mediated RNAi in dopaminergic MN9D cells and examined the effect of down-regulation of α-synuclein on TH and DA biosynthesis.

As an internal control, β-actin cDNA was co-amplified using the following primer sequences: 5′-CCCATCTACGAGGGCTACGC-3′ (forward) and 5′-AGGAAGGAGGGCTGGAACA-3′ (reverse). Each PCR was started by predenaturation at 96°C for 3 min. Each PCR cycle consisted of 94°C for 30 s, 50°C for 55 s and 72°C for 55 s, followed by a final 10 min extension at 72°C. PCR amplification was carried out for 35 cycles for α-synuclein and 22 cycles for β-actin using a Perkin–Elmer DNA thermal cycler 480 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA).

Quantitative PCR was performed in duplicate or triplicate using a 7300 real-time PCR thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems). Each reaction was started by 50°C for 2 min, 95°C for 10 min and 96°C for 3 min, followed by 40 cycles of 94°C for 15 s, 59°C for 20 s and 72°C for 30 s.

]. Protein concentrations were determined using BCA relative to BSA protein standards according to the manufacturer (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA). Whole cell protein extracts were resolved by SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Prestained protein standards were used to determine the relative molecular mass of proteins. The membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline, then incubated with the TH specific monoclonal antibody (1:5000, Sigma) or α-synuclein specific monoclonal antibody (2E3; 1:1000) at room temperature for 3 h, followed by a 1-h incubation with a peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:5000, ZhongShan, Beijing, China) at room temperature. The blots were washed and immunodetection was carried out by chemiluminescence using SuperSignal (Pierce). Blots were then stripped and re-probed with an antibody against β-actin (1:500, Zhongshan). Blots were scanned using Kodak Image Station (440 CF; Kodak, Rochester, MN, USA) and the optical densities of the bands relative to β-actin within each lane were obtained.

Results
Construction of the shRNA Expression Plasmids
After synthesis, each pair of the ss oligos was annealed to generate ds oligos. The annealing efficiency was analyzed by 4% agarose gel electrophoresis. Each ds oligo annealing reactant showed a clearly detectable molecular weight band around 50 bp, as expected for the length of the designed ds oligos. The 50 bp bands were brighter than the corresponding lower molecular weight band, which represented the unannealed ss oligos in the annealing reactant. These data indicate that each pair of ss oligos annealed effectively to form ds oligos. The ds oligos were ligated with linearized pENTR™/H1/TO vectors and the positive clones were expanded and verified by PCR. Bands near 350 bp were found in all PCR reactants, indicating that the ds oligos were ligated into the pENTR/H1/TO vectors. Further analysis by sequencing confirmed that the orientation and sequence of the inserted ds oligos were correct.

], which is consistent with our results. We propose that the difference in TH levels between the present α-synuclein silenced system and the previously described α-synuclein over-expression system is mainly due to the different cell types and not due to the different ways in which the cells were manipulated.

In conclusion, our data demonstrate that in PD pathology, silencing of α-synuclein expression results in enhanced TH activity and increased DA levels in neurons. We propose that in cells that unable to remove excess DA from the cytosol, DA itself and its oxidized products including reactive oxygen species and reactive DA quinones may lead to cell injury or even death. Further understanding of the normal function of α-synuclein in maintaining DA homeostasis may help to identify novel preventative or therapeutic strategies for PD.
