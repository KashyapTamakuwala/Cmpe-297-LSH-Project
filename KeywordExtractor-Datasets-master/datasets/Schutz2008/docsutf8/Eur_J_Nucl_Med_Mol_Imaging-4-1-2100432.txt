Background
We used PET to study cortical activation during auditory stimulation and found sex differences in the human primary auditory cortex (PAC). Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was measured in 10 male and 10 female volunteers while listening to sounds (music or white noise) and during a baseline (no auditory stimulation).

Results and discussion
We found a sex difference in activation of the left and right PAC when comparing music to noise. The PAC was more activated by music than by noise in both men and women. But this difference between the two stimuli was significantly higher in men than in women. To investigate whether this difference could be attributed to either music or noise, we compared both stimuli with the baseline and revealed that noise gave a significantly higher activation in the female PAC than in the male PAC. Moreover, the male group showed a deactivation in the right prefrontal cortex when comparing noise to the baseline, which was not present in the female group. Interestingly, the auditory and prefrontal regions are anatomically and functionally linked and the prefrontal cortex is known to be engaged in auditory tasks that involve sustained or selective auditory attention. Thus we hypothesize that differences in attention result in a different deactivation of the right prefrontal cortex, which in turn modulates the activation of the PAC and thus explains the sex differences found in the activation of the PAC.

Conclusion
Our results suggest that sex is an important factor in auditory brain studies.

]. However, it has not been investigated whether nonspeech sounds can induce different activity in the PAC in both sexes.
In the present study, we investigated potential sex differences in the activity of the primary auditory region, using different auditory stimuli.

Material and methods
Subjects
Twenty healthy, right-handed volunteers participated in this study (10 males, 10 females). The mean age for men was 23 years (range 20–25) and for women 22 years (range 19–27). All volunteers gave written informed consent according to the Declaration of Helsinki and the Medical Ethics Committee of the University Medical Center Groningen approved the study. None of the subjects had any history of psychiatric or neurological disorders. Prior to the scanning, subjects were tested for their hearing thresholds using standard audiometric measures. All subjects had normal hearing thresholds (<20 dBHL, 0.25–8 kHz), and only small intersubject variations in hearing thresholds were observed.

Data acquisition

Experimental design

O]-water in the brain starts. Subjects were instructed to close their eyes, not to move during the scans, and to listen to the auditory stimuli. Before each scan we informed the volunteers that the scan was about to start. Immediately after each scan the volunteers were questioned about the scan (did they hear the stimulus? were they uncomfortable or distracted?). During scanning we monitored the subjects with infrared cameras.

Data analysis
31
]. An ANOVA estimated the following parameters: two groups (male and female), three conditions (baseline, noise, and music) and the mean perfusion to normalize for global flow differences (multigroup, conditions, and covariates). Each scan was scaled to a mean global activity of 50 ml/100 ml/min. Hypotheses about regionally specific condition effects were tested to compare the estimates by using linear compounds or contrasts. The resulting set of voxel values for these contrasts constituted the associated SPM of the t-statistics.

Discussion
Our data demonstrate a sex difference in regional cerebral blood flow in the left and right primary auditory cortex (PAC) when comparing auditory processing of music and noise. The PAC was more activated by music than by noise in both men and women. But this difference between the two stimuli was significantly higher in men than in women. To determine whether this sex difference can be attributed to the processing of music, noise, or both, we compared the two stimuli with a baseline of no auditory stimulation. Comparing music with the baseline resulted in extensive activation of the primary and secondary auditory cortex in both sexes, but no significant sex difference was found. On the other hand, a sex difference was detected in the processing of noise, because females activated their PAC significantly more than males. The finding that sex differences in auditory processing can already be detected at the level of the primary cortex is very important, because it is often assumed that sex differences act exclusively upon higher-order cortical areas.

]. Although the SPM analysis showed no activation at all for the male group and a very significant activation for the female group, it did not have enough power to detect a significant difference between the two groups. Because of the enhanced sensitivity of an ROI analysis, this analysis did show a significant sex difference. Of course, caution has to be made when pooling data to improve the sensitivity and is therefore only allowed in a priori defined regions, in this case the PAC.

]. It must be noted that even though our data indicate differences in the auditory system, no independent behavioural data regarding the attention levels during scanning are available. Hence, the present experimental design only allows us to speculate about the correlation between the different deactivation of the prefrontal cortex and differences in attention. Further research is needed to fully clarify the role of attention on PAC activation and to determine whether our results can be repeated. Furthermore, other auditory conditions like pure tones, noise bursts, and speech (sense and nonsense) sounds are needed to fully map the influence of sex on central auditory processing and to investigate lateralization differences between the sexes.

]) where the inhibition of constant irrelevant stimuli in men may facilitate them to focus their attention to a single task, e.g. hunting, this concept remains speculation.
In conclusion, a very significant sexual dichotomy was found in the activation of the PAC with different types of acoustic stimuli (noise and music) together with sex differences in deactivation of prefrontal areas. It is known that the auditory and prefrontal regions are anatomically and functionally linked, and the prefrontal cortex is engaged in auditory attention tasks. Hence, we hypothesize that differences in attention might result in a different involvement of the right prefrontal cortex, which in turn modulates the activation of the PAC. This shows that sex influences brain activity already at the level of primary sensory cortex and that in functional imaging studies on primary sensory cortical areas, sex cannot be ignored.
