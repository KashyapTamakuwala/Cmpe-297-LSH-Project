Background
Patient access to primary care appointments is not routinely measured despite the increasing interest in this aspect of practice activity. The generation of standardised data (or benchmarks) for access could inform developments within primary care organisations and act as a quality marker for clinical governance. Logically the setting of targets should be based on a sound system of measurement. The practicalities of developing appropriate measures need debate. Therefore we aimed to search for and compare methods that have been published or are being developed to measure patient access to primary care appointments, with particular focus on finding methods using appointment system data.

Method
A search and review was made of the primary care literature from 1990 to 2001, which included an assessment of online resources (websites) and communication with recognised experts. The identified methods were assessed.

Results
The published literature in this specific area was not extensive but revealed emerging interest in the late 1990s. Two broad approaches to the measurement of waiting times to GP appointments were identified. Firstly, appointment systems in primary care organisations were analysed in differing ways to provide numerical data and, secondly, patient perceptions (reports) of access were evaluated using survey techniques. Six different methods were found which were based on appointment systems data.

Conclusion
The two approaches of either using patient questionnaires or appointment system data are methods that represent entirely different aims. The latter method when used to represent patient waiting times for 'routine' elective appointments seems to hold promise as a useful tool and this avoids the definitional problems that surround 'urgent' appointments. The purpose for which the data is being collected needs to be borne in mind and will determine the chosen methods of data retrieval and representation.

Recognising the complex nature of this issue, we set out to review the literature. Our main aim was to search the international primary care literature for methods that had been, or were being developed to measure access to GP appointments, focusing on measures using appointment system data. Once identified, existing methods (tools, scales or other instruments) would be compared, with specific attention given to the type and levels of access they aimed to assess.

Studies or articles were included in the review if they described tools, scales, questionnaires or other methods of measuring actual patient access to appointments. We also included descriptions of methods that were currently being developed in this field, provided they had undertaken pilot studies and had completed one data collection exercise. Articles were excluded if they were purely editorial.

Results
A total of 1763 citations were initially identified and 38 articles retrieved for detailed assessment from the Pubmed and the Medline searches. Clin Psych and ASSIA searches provided some overlap but no new relevant material. The most helpful pointers to relevant publications were obtained from the website searches and personal communications rather than the traditional search engines. Two broad approaches to the measurement of patient access were identified. Firstly, appointment systems in organisations were analysed in differing ways to provide numerical data and, secondly, patient perceptions (reports) of access were evaluated using survey techniques.

Discussion
Principal findings
This review of access measurement reveals the heterogeneous nature of the methods and the lack of any widely accepted conceptualisation of patient access. Identified measures are either practice centred using appointment data or patient orientated via surgery satisfaction questionnaires. It is clear that these two methods represent entirely different aims. It is not possible for episodic patient surveys to provide data that has enough currency or accuracy to inform organisational responses to patient demand.

appointments suit individuals who value an agreed time window over other factors. The methods that represent patient waiting times for 'routine', i.e. elective appointments seem to hold promise as they avoid the definitional problems that surround 'urgent' appointments, and the different views that patients, clinicians and others have about 'urgency'. The task of deciding whether to represent access profiles for organisations or for individual clinicians also needs careful consideration. It may be more feasible (and less threatening) to routinely measure organisational access, especially if the data is to be used for benchmarking purposes.

appointments. We have distinguished two approaches to overcome this, either for a full statistical analysis using compatible systems or data retrieval software, or to use a simple snapshot method, deciding whether data-smoothing methods such as daily moving averages or aggregated weekly median scores are the best portrayal of overall access patterns.

Strengths and weaknesses of the study
Multiple search methods were used to ensure that the breadth of literature and online resources were examined as systematically as possible. The searches proved difficult and reflect the emergent status and the diversity of terms used in this area. We may have overlooked methods developed in other healthcare systems.

Implications of the findings to healthcare services and research
The lack of a widely agreed measurement method to represent patient access to primary care services will make it impossible for practices to compare their response to patient demand with any degree of certainty. The 'third appointment' system is the most widely used method and is currently supported by the National Primary Care Development Team in England (but has no equivalent support in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland). It is however a relatively complex manipulation of appointment system data, and incorporates individual clinician availability. It seems from first principles that the important requirements of a tool designed to measure a dynamic concept such as patient access is simplicity and ease of regular data collection, so that longitudinal data patterns capable of indicating trends in organisations can be generated rather than data on individual clinician availability.
