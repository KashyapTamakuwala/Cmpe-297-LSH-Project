] GEO has grown from
18,235 records in June 2004 to 115,415 records in December 2006, reflecting an average growth of over 100 new entries per day. A subset of this information describes the embryo proper
and can be mined for major biological themes in developmental health and disease. Using keyword searches and trend analysis to mine PubMed and Medline literature databases, the public
availability of embryo-based microarrays currently numbers 500-600 (564), mostly studies on mouse embryos and differentiating human cell lines.

] Given the promises and pitfalls of computational methods for
solving gene expression problems, automated access to a reference collection of gene-expression signatures to benchmark the programmed (genetic) and adaptive (environmental)
regulation of the embryonic transcriptome is scientifically needed.

This open resource enables: consolidation of communal data and metadata relevant to developmental health and disease; interactions with current builds of national databases and data
repositories; efficient algorithms for cross-species annotation of symbolic gene annotations using the NCBI sequence homologybased annotations for corresponding homologues and
orthologues; specific queries across experiments to facilitate secondary analysis; and data formats interoperable with analysis software for phenetic clustering, chromosomal mapping, gene
ontology classification, pathway evaluation, and network identification.

] BDSM currently holds 25
developmental series containing 537 samples that are derived from the public domain and 3 series containing 43 samples which are private. These data represent 15 developing organ
systems, 6 chemical exposures, and 5 drug interventions across 42 development stages.

] Samples included in this series represent development of the oocyte through fertilization
(1-cell embryo), activation of the zygotic genome (2-cell embryo) and first differentiation (8-cell embryo) leading to divergent embryonal (inner cell mass) and trophectodermal
(placental) lineages of the blastocyst. Biological replicates (3-4) arrayed at each stage used three different Affymetrix platforms: MOE430Av2 (22690 probes), MOE430Bv2 (22576 probes), and
MG-U74Av2 (12488 probes). Gene-expression profiles were normalized to the ‘oocyte’ in each platform as the earliest stage in the series. Derived data are log2-scale expression values
computed from the ratio of signals to the oocyte reference.

 tools do not have this limitation.
These tools create temporary tables in the Oracle database and join them using the functionality of Oracle before putting it into a text file, reducing restrictions on the number of samples and
size of files. Although users can theoretically combine 100 files at a single time, it is not recommended to load more then 25 files at a time.


Conclusion
The representation of experimental samples as developmentally contiguous groups is expected to yield a novel mosaic view of gene-expression signatures and genetic dependencies. Although
sufficient data exists for data-mining efforts to begin, the ultimate goal of an unabridged reference collection must be viewed as a long-term effort. Regarding the embryo, a search of
OVID MedLine using keywords ‘embryo’ OR ‘teratogen’ (136,146 records) AND ‘microarray’ OR ‘SAGE’ (16,906 records) returned 343 total records. At the current rate of 564
microarrays per 343 publication records (factor = 1.64), the trajectory of embryo-based microarray publications projects GEO to hold in excess of 1,476 microarrays relevant for
embryogenesis or teratogenesis by the year 2010.

] Since interpreting geneexpression signatures in birth defects will be predicated on
posterior (prior) knowledge about developmental health and disease, an important payoff from this bioinformatics effort is to recognize and characterize how these biological states emerge
from adaptation or adverse regulation of the embryonic transcriptome.

 Differentially expressed across GEO data series GSE1391 based on 3 Affymetrix platforms. Statistical (ANOVA) analysis selected significant genes with Benjamini-Hochberg
correction (alpha = 0.0001 for MOE430Av2, alpha = 0.001 for MG-U74Av2, alpha = 0.05*, 0.01**, and 0.001*** for MetaChip). The number of probes or genes passing at the
alpha level is given (No.). Functional annotation of the Affymetrix probe identifiers (MOE430Av2, MG-U74Av2) mapped the significant KEGG pathways (P-value, threshold set
to 6 genes). Functional annotation of the 432A-U74A MetaChip used UniGene identifiers and CIAeasy used unique DAVID identifiers.

. Expression values were from statistical (ANOVA) analysis returning 4417 (MOE430Av2, alpha =
0.0001), 1614 (MOE430Bv2, alpha = 0.0001), and 2400 (MG-U74Av2, alpha = 0.001) probes. UPPER PANEL: Clustering of
samples: Oocyte (Oo), 1-cell embryo (1C), 2-cell embryo (2C), 8-cell embryo (8C), and blastocyst (BL). For each platform a boxplot
shows the log2 distribution of expression values for the probes at each stage (line = median, box = 75%, whiskers = 95%, and dots =
outliers) and a histogram plots the cumulative distribution of probes in each expression bin. LOWER PANEL: The first two axes of
ordination were projected by CIA. The horizontal axis reflects the first axis of the inertia and the vertical axis is the second axis of
inertia. Circles (dots) and arrowheads (arrows) represent the projected coordinates of each platform being compared, with length of the
line joining them being proportional to their divergence, e.g., shorter arrows indicate stronger joint trends between the platforms. The
left compares joint trends in MOE430Av2 (dot) versus MOE430Bv2 (arrow), measure of global similarity, RV = 0.976; middle
compares MOE430Av2 (dot) versus MG-U74Av2 (arrow), RV = 0.999; right compares MOE430Bv2 (dot) versus MG-U74Av2
