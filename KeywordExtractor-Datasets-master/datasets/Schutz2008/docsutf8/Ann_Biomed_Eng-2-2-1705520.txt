Bioartificial tissues are useful model systems for studying cell and extra-cellular matrix mechanics. These tissues provide a 3D environment for cells and allow tissue components to be easily modified and quantified. In this study, we fabricated bioartificial tissue rings from a 1 ml solution containing one million cardiac fibroblasts and 1 mg collagen. After 8 days, rings compacted to <1% of original volume and cell number increased 2.4 fold. We initiated continuous cyclic stretching of the rings after 2, 4, or 8 days of incubation, while monitoring the tissue forces. Peak tissue force during each cycle decreased rapidly after initiating stretch, followed by further slow decline. We added 2 μM Cytochalasin-D to some rings prior to initiation of stretch to determine the force contributed by the matrix. Cell force was estimated by subtracting matrix force from tissue force. After 12 h, matrix force-strain curves were highly nonlinear. Cell force-strain curves were linear during loading and showed hysteresis indicating viscoelastic behavior. Cell stiffness increased with stretching frequency from 0.001–0.25 Hz. Cell stiffness decreased with stretch amplitude (5–25%) at 0.1 Hz. The trends in cell stiffness do not fit simple viscoelastic models previously proposed, and suggest possible strain-amplitude related changes during cyclic stretch.

 However, whether this drop occurs in the cells and/or matrix components is not known. Furthermore, it is not known how these drops are affected by different amplitudes and frequencies over many hours of continuous cyclic stretch.

 These cells, along with the cardiac myocytes, undergo continuous cyclic stretch with each heartbeat. Thus, it is particularly useful to understand their cellular mechanics during cyclic stretch.
By measuring the cell forces under various cyclic stretch amplitudes and frequencies, we can better understand the relationship between the applied strains and the cells’ mechanical response. Then we can model this behavior and be able to predict cellular responses to dynamic physiologic and pathologic loading conditions.

 that allows independent programmable stretching of four rings while monitoring applied force. The test medium contained DMEM HEPES modification supplemented with 10% FBS and P/S. All rings were placed on the tester at a baseline length that maintained the inner circumference of 30 mm. This was defined as 0% strain. In early tests, stretching began immediately after mounting the rings. This led to increases in peak force after initiation of stretch for low amplitudes at early incubation times. Upon further study, it was determined this was a result of the fresh media and FBS used in the test baths and not a result of a mechanical stretch induced response. In all further studies, the rings were mounted on the tester and held at baseline length for 3 h to allow them to reach equilibrium before testing began.

Single Step Stretch and Hold Effect
To compare the effect of a single stretch to cyclic stretching, a step stretch (stretch to a given stretch magnitude in less than 0.1 s) of 5%, 10%, or 20% was applied and the rings were held at this stretched length for 8 h while the force was monitored. The tissue was then returned to its baseline length and the force was monitored for an additional 6 h. In another set of experiments, CytoD was added 3 h before or 12 h after either a 10% or 20% step stretch.

Effect of Cyclic Stretch Frequency
A similar procedure was followed to test frequency effects. Four rings were tested at each of the three days with each ring stretched at either 0.25 Hz, 0.1 Hz, 0.01 Hz, or 0.001 Hz at 10% stretch amplitude. The current tester’s upper frequency limit is 0.25 Hz and thus unable to stretch at higher frequencies that are closer to physiologic values. CytoD was added either 3 h before or 12 h after initiation of stretch to separate out the cell and matrix components as a result of different frequencies of cyclic stretch.

Cell Number
After the completion of testing, some rings were washed in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and then placed in 1 ml lysis buffer (0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) in PBS). The samples were sonicated until the rings completely disintegrated to release the DNA from the cells. Finally, 30 μl of sample was placed in 3 ml of Hoechst working solution (30 nM Hoechst 33258 dye (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) in PBS). The fluorescence was then read by a spectrophotometer and cell number determined from a standard curve obtained from samples with known numbers of cells.

Immunohistochemistry
Rings were removed from spacers after 2, 4, or 8 days static incubation and immediately placed in a solution of 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min, washed with PBS and then permeabilized for 45 min in 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS. This was followed by 1 h incubation in a blocking solution (2% normal goat serum and 0.02% sodium azide in PBS). After blocking, the rings were incubated overnight at 4°C in blocking solution containing TRITC phalloidin. Finally, the rings were washed again in PBS and mounted for viewing on a confocal microscope (Zeiss Confocor).

(c)). For the first stretch, the ratio of peak forces at day 8 for 25% to 5% was 5:1, but this ratio decreased to 2:1 after 12 h of stretching, due to the peak matrix force dropping by a greater percentage at the higher amplitudes over time. The other distinct feature was the shape of the loading/unloading curves.

(c)). This meant that the matrix contributed to the tissue force during the loading only when the strain had reached a value from 3 to 7% less than its maximum value. This shape and shift is evident at days 2, 4, and 8. For all stretch amplitudes, the matrix is slack at low strains.

). The cell force is approximately the same at both 10% and 20% step stretches during the 12 h held at the stretched length. For both step stretch magnitudes, the cell force at the end of the 12 h hold period is similar to the cell force at the baseline length (data not shown) immediately before the step stretch is applied.
Rings that did not have CytoD added before or during the step stretch were returned to their baseline lengths after being held at the stretched length for 8 h. The force dropped to zero but then began to recover with lower magnitude step stretches increasing their forces faster than higher magnitude step stretches. The recovered forces approached their baseline forces prior to stretch. After 6 h of monitoring force at baseline, rings stretched to 5% magnitude and held recovered more of their baseline force (84%) than rings stretched to 20% magnitude (42%).
The force decreases more rapidly in the step stretch and hold than the peak force drops in cyclic stretching at the same amplitude.

DISCUSSION
18
 it is likely the actin cytoskeleton is primarily responsible for the change in cell stiffness. Whether this is a result of cytoskeletal remodeling and/or reduction in active contraction/relaxation of the myosin is not known.
While the initial extracellular matrix consists entirely of collagen it is reasonable to assume that over 8 days of incubation time that additional cell-contributed matrix may be produced. We have incubated rings for 20 days prior to cyclic stretching and found that the matrix force-strain curves are similar to those after 8 days of incubation. Peak forces increase only a small amount at 5% or 10% stretch amplitude after 14 h of cyclic stretch at 0.1 Hz. These results suggest that the matrix mechanics do not change substantially even in the presence of cells that can produce additional matrix.

 but comparing the shapes of the force-strain curves is difficult due to differences in experimental methods.

 The cellular mechanism for this response is not clear, but Discher and co-workers suggest that both “outside-in” and “inside-outside-in” pathways may be involved. Whether 3-D culture conditions or cyclic stretching reduce the influence of matrix stiffness on cellular mechanics remains to be investigated.
Since it is the cells that are responding to the mechanical conditioning it is important to realize that while the cells are undergoing a higher strain they are not undergoing a higher stress. So if the cells respond to stress, higher stretch amplitudes will not increase this response. Since both the cells and the tissues at different stretch amplitudes maintain similar stresses, it is reasonable to assume the cells are responding to maintain a certain range of mechanical stresses.
11
 At days 2 and 4 it is unlikely that this critical cell density is reached but it is surpassed based on cell density by day 8.
Unlike the cells that respond to increased stretch amplitude by decreasing their stiffness, the matrix force-strain curves shift so that the matrix contributes only when the strain is within 3%–7% of the maximum value with the matrix contributing over a slightly larger range of strains at higher stretch amplitudes. This response of the matrix does not appear to depend upon the cells having an actin cytoskeleton, since we found a similar response when cytoD is added either before stretch is initiated or after 12 h of stretch. After 12 h of cyclic stretch, the peak matrix force is only slightly higher with increased stretch amplitude. With different frequencies of cyclic stretch, the peak matrix force is similar but the matrix contributes over a larger range of strains at lower frequencies. For a 10% stretch, the matrix contributes to the last 6% of the stretch at 0.001 Hz while contributing only to the last 4% at 0.25 Hz.
The higher baseline tissue and cell forces seen at lower frequencies (0.001 Hz and 0.01 Hz) are consistent with a simple viscoelastic model because the tissues and cells have more time to recover before being stretched again. The same is seen in the lower amplitudes at 0.1 Hz (5% and 10%) which are able to maintain a baseline force. These correspond to the lowest strain rates and may allow for recovery.
For a linear viscoelastic material undergoing continuous cyclic stretch, both higher stretch amplitudes and higher strain rates will lead to higher peak forces. For cyclic stretch at constant frequency, the highest stretch amplitude also corresponds to the highest strain rate. However, we observed that the peak cell force decreased as the amplitude (and the strain rate) increased. We also note that the decrease in peak cell force is a function of both stretch amplitude and strain rate because similar strain rates (5%/s) at different amplitudes (e.g. 10% @ 0.25 Hz and 25% @ 0.1 Hz) show different tissue, matrix and cell responses In the case of the matrix at 25% @ 0.1 Hz, there is no positive matrix force until the strain increases beyond 10%; whereas there is matrix force below 10% strain during cyclic stretch at 10% @ 0.25 Hz.

 at day 8 suggests a reduced role of the calcium dependent pathway.
In addition, these results have important implications for the tissue engineering field, especially for those tissues that undergo continuous deformations such as in the cardiovascular system. By isolating the cell contribution to tissue force, we are able to provide a better understanding of the mechanical environment of the cell and aid in designing mechanical conditioning protocols that improve tissue properties. For example, the peak cell force is not constant during cyclic stretch and thus cell stimulation varies with time. Furthermore, if cell response is dependent on cell stress or force, increasing the amplitude of conditioning will not increase and may decrease the applied cell force.

 While failure tests are necessary, the response of the tissue and cells under physiologic loading is also vital. We have shown that mechanical properties may change dramatically over hours after initiation of stretch. These changes have implications on tissue function in vivo after implantation and these changes cannot be captured in simple failure tests.

CONCLUSIONS
We have shown that bioartificial tissue constructs consisting of a single cell type and matrix component are a useful model system in which to explore tissue, matrix, and cell mechanics. The cell response to cyclic stretch is complex and depends on both the amplitude and frequency of cyclic stretch. The change in cell stiffness with amplitude behavior does not fit current cellular mechanics models. Future investigations may explore the microstructural basis for this behavior.
