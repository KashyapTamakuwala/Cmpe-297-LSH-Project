The ability of humans to predict and explain other people’s behaviour by attributing independent mental states such as desires and beliefs to them, is considered to be due to our ability to construct a “Theory of Mind”. Recently, several neuroimaging studies have implicated the medial frontal lobes as playing a critical role in a dedicated “mentalizing” or “Theory of Mind” network in the human brain. In this study we compare the performance of patients with right and left medial prefrontal lobe lesions in theory of mind and in social cognition tasks, with the performance of people with schizophrenia.
We report a similar social cognitive profile between patients with prefrontal lobe lesions and schizophrenic subjects in terms of understanding of false beliefs, in understanding social situations and in using tactical strategies. These findings are relevant for the functional anatomy of “Theory of Mind”.

However, empirically controlled investigations in which the cognitive profile of brain damaged patients was compared with schizophrenic subjects with an appropriate set of ToM and social intelligence tasks are lacking, thus leaving several crucial questions largely unresolved.
In the current study, we examined the performance of stabilized schizophrenic outpatients, inpatients with focal damage of left and right ventromedial prefrontal lobes and healthy controls, in ToM abilities, in social competence and tactical strategy (Machiavellian Intelligence), to clarify whether schizophrenic patients demonstrate impairment similar to ventromedial prefrontal lesion patients and whether their performance in these tasks can be differentiated from their performance in tasks sensitive to neuropsychological dysfunction, including “executive” functions. Our prediction is that an overlapping dysfunctional cognitive profile should emerge between brain damaged and schizophrenic subjects, when compared to healthy subjects. We also addressed several methodological issues raised by earlier studies using social cognition tasks created for adults and not for children.

Methods
Participants
The subjects for this study included 18 adult neurosurgical patients with unilateral frontal lobe lesions who had undergone surgery at the Department of Neurosurgery of “S. Salvatore” Hospital, L’Aquila, Italy. The patients were consecutively enrolled in the study from January 2003 to September 2005.
Only patients with exclusive frontal lesions were identified and brain damage was confirmed through neuroimaging, with pre- and postoperative CT scanning and MRIs.

Thirteen subjects had intra- or extra-axial tumours (72%); 3 had spontaneous haemorrhage (17%) and 2 (11%) had intracerebral haemorrhage from ruptured aneurysms.
In the RMPFC group seven patients had a tumour removed (four had a meningioma excised, 2 had a high grade glioma excised and 1 had an oligodendroglioma excised), one had a right anterior communicating artery (ACoA) aneurysm clipped, following rupture and one had spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage with no evidence of arterial malformations. Of the LMPFC patients, six had a tumour removed (five had a meningioma excised and one had a high grade astrocytoma excised), two had spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage with no evidence of arterial malformations and one had a left ACoA aneurysm clipped following rupture.

False belief test question
. This was designed to elicit a response that demonstrated the ability to make inferences about another individual’s mental state, namely, that a character in the story holds a false belief.

Fact question
. This was posed to determine whether subjects understood the actual sequence of relevant events that had occurred in the story which is in contrast with the sequence as understood by one of the characters in the story and that leads to his coming to a false conclusion.

Memory question
. This was used to assess whether memory for story details was approximately intact. The stories were the same for all the subjects examined. Each subject obtained a score ranging from 0 to 1 in the case of a correct answer to a False-belief question, to the fact question and to the memory question, where 0 = incorrect answer; 1 = correct answer. If the subject gave a correct answer to both the first order stories, s/he had a global score for first order ToM equal to 1 (non-casual performance). For second order false belief stories we followed the same methods.

] report that previous piloting on a large, independent sample of healthy controls had resulted in the identification of a set of consistently identified normative situations and violations.
Two scores were obtained for this task: one referring to the number of normative situations and the other to the number of violations correctly identified. The third refers to the extent to which the patient judged the violations to be socially inappropriate.
For each situation, the participant obtained a score between 0 and 3, matching their response of “A” to “D” (i.e. “A” = 0, “D” = 3).


Mach IV Scale
50
]. This is a self-report Likert scale, with scores ranging from 1 to 7 (where 1 = I totally disagree; 4 = no opinion; 7 = I totally agree), composed of 20 items, each consisting of a statement.
The Mach IV scale is a method for assessing awareness and social functioning in a social context characterised by interpersonal deception (“Machiavellianism”).
From the 20 statements of the Mach IV Scale we extracted two groups of items: (1) 5 items describing duplicity tactics, e.g.: “It is wise to flatter important people” (“tactics+”) and (2) 4 items describing a disagreements with tactics duplicity, e.g.: “When you ask someone to do something for you, it is best to give the real reason” (“tactics−”).
The items were labelled for coding as follows:
Positive tactics (tactics+): subjects must agree with statements reporting the ability to manipulate other people’s intentions and actions, according to Niccolò Machiavelli’s beliefs.

Human nature components referring to “people’s knowledge”, in particular the degree of cynicism concerning other people’s intentions and decisions are strictly related to the ability to interpret other people’s mental states.

Discussion
One of the distinctive attributes of human social cognition is our propensity to build models of other people’s minds: to make inferences about the mental states of others. Several neuroimaging studies have attempted to elucidate the neural substrates that support this distinctively human ability that is impaired in people with schizophrenia.

55
56
]. It has been suggested that theory of mind deficit make unable schizophrenic subjects to interact effectively with their social environment, but that a lack of certain aspects of social cognition will lead to social misperceptions.
In addition to these clinical and outcome goals, there is increasing interest in identifying the neural substrates that underlie social cognitive deficits in schizophrenia. For all of these reasons we compared the performances on social cognition tasks of schizophrenic subjects with the performances of MPFC subjects.

We found out that subjects with RMPFC lesion are impaired in ToM tasks of “false beliefs”, showing thus a very similar cognitive dysfunctional profile to people affected by schizophrenia in all Theory of Mind tasks and in all social cognition tasks. A normal performance on control questions indicates an unimpaired comprehension of stories and suggest that the task was sensitive in detecting TOM impairments.
In addition, schizophrenics and subjects with RMPFC lesion also showed impairment in the social cognition tasks, in fact they both failed to discriminate in judging inappropriate behaviour likely to induce anger in observers. This was unlike patients with LMPFC who showed no impairment on any of these tasks.

], that a hierarchical organization of mental operation, when disrupted at a specified level, impairs the integrity of final output via an interruption of the chain of events required to perform a task. This study is limited by the small number of patients with unilateral frontal lobe lesions due to the rarity of such lesion.
Despite this limitation, this study provides further evidence that social competence is compromised in RMPFC subjects very closely to schizophrenics and these data seem to elucidate the possible neuroanatomic structure alteration present in schizophrenia. However, we are confident that there is a wide range of behavioural manifestations of frontal lobe dysfunction, and ToM impairments clearly cannot account for all of these, nor is it likely to be responsible for all reported difficulties in social cognition. In contrast, ToM tests are designed with the aim of isolating those aspects of social cognition associated with two-way reciprocal interactions that rely crucially on ToM ability and false belief tasks have facilitated the demonstration of a mentalizing impairment in subjects with lesions of the prefrontal cortex, which is independent of non-mental state inference.

We support two positions: first, that a specialized, discrete ToM module, or set of modules, is located in the frontal lobes, but is functionally independent and second that these deficits can co-occur, on the basis of the proximity of the respective underlying neural areas.
