 analyzed their patient cohort of 1,431 patients having open RYGB and found a 1.9% mortality, which was associated with age, weight, longer limb gastric bypass, and the occurrence of a leak or pulmonary embolism.
This report is a multivariate analysis of preoperative mortality and morbidity in 1,000 consecutive open RYGBs performed over a 5-year period by a single surgeon (LF) in at a single institution.

Materials and Methods
Bariatric Surgery Program
 The bariatric surgery program at St. Luke’s–Roosevelt Hospital Center in New York City was initiated in April 1999 and the first operation performed in June 1999. The basis of this report consists of 1,000 consecutive open RYGBs (primary cases and revisions) performed by a single surgeon, LF, between June 1999 and June 2004.

)]. Follow-up was 74% at 1 year, 68% at 2 years, 59% at 3 years, 53% at 4 years, and 48% at 5 years.
Clinical Data and Data Analysis
 Clinical and laboratory data were PC-based database prospectively maintained since the program’s inception in 1999. Data collected included: age, sex, height weight, BMI, race/ethnicity, payer status, obesity-related comorbidities, operative procedure, duration of stay, mortality, major complications, and death. Complications were classified as systemic (prolonged intubation, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and myocardial infarction/fatal arrhythmia) or technical (incisional hernia, intestinal obstruction, leak/perforation, dehiscence, GI bleeding, anastomotic stricture, and anastomotic ulcer). Deaths were analyzed with respect to BMI, demographics, comorbidities, and complications.Superficial wound infections were not included; the incidence of urinary tract infections was not tracked. Nutritional complications were not evaluated because all patients were routinely maintained on vitamins, iron, and calcium supplements postoperatively; it would be impossible to determine the true incidence of any of these nutritional deficiencies.Univariate analyses and logistic regression with SPSS 11.0 were used to determine significance.

The most common comorbidites encountered were dyspnea on exertion (94%), joint pain/arthritis (92%), and gastroesophageal reflux disease (59%). The comorbidites typically associated with systemic disease included hypertension (HTN, 39%), obstructive sleep apnea (SA, 24%), dyslipidemia (46%), and asthma (15%). Approximately 23% of the patient population suffered from type II diabetes mellitus (DM). At time of initial evaluation, 13.0% of this diabetic patient subset had a prior history of insulin-dependent DM, 57.6% had noninsulin dependent DM, and 23% had a previous diagnosis of DM intermittently controlled on diet or were newly diagnosed with DM during their preoperative evaluation. Six percent of the patient population had angiographically documented histories of coronary artery disease (CAD) but were deemed suitable risk by their respective specialists.
Procedures and Duration of Hospital Stay
 There were 966 primary RYGB and 34 revisions of failed bariatric procedures (21—VBG, 5—RYGB, 8—other; all performed at outside institutions) to RYGB. The median length of stay for primary procedures was 2.4 days compared to 3.7 days for revisions. Average (LOS) for all patients having primary RYGB was 3.8 days with 87% of the group leaving in 3 days or less.

Thirty-one patients (3.1%) required reoperation within 30 days of the original procedure. The indications for reoperation within 30 days were leak/perforation (11), intestinal obstruction (9), bleeding (4), rule-out leak (2), dehiscence (4), and subphrenic abscess (1).Indications for late operations (>30 days postoperatively) included incisional hernia repair in 35 patients, intestinal obstruction in 10 patients, and repair of leaks/perforations in five patients who were experiencing ongoing postoperative complications. No patients required reoperation for refractory anastomatic stricture or ulcer. One patient developed a gastrogastric fistula after repair of an early leak, which was treated expectantly since it was clinically insignificant. No late gastrogastric fistulae were identified.

Discussion
The tremendous growth of bariatric surgery over the past several years has spawned much interest in its complications and mortality, first in the media, but most recently in the public health arena as well. Health and malpractice insurance carriers as well as governmental agencies and professional societies are evaluating the risks of bariatric surgery and the surgeons that perform it. In several states, insurance companies have stopped covering bariatric surgery at the same time that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services have approved coverage for them. Several malpractice carriers have stopped issuing policies for surgeons performing bariatric procedures while others are categorizing bariatric surgery as a high-risk subspecialty area, similar to obstetrics and neurosurgery, and increasing premiums accordingly. In each of these instances, the overriding fear or consideration appears to be that the risks associated with bariatric surgery are excessively high.

 reported a 1.5% perioperative mortality rate, with 0.8% dying of sepsis, 0.5% dying of pulmonary embolism, and 0.2% of an unknown cause.

. The prevalence of preoperative comorbidities was comparable to the larger series (diabetes—23%, hypertension—39%, dyslipidemia—46%, coronary artery disease/congestive heart failure—5.5%, sleep apnea—23.5%, and asthma—15%) and generally higher than in the pooled series. The incidence of leaks and postoperative small bowel obstruction in our series was comparable to the other series. The incidence of pulmonary embolism was less than those reported, perhaps related to the use of both pneumatic compression stockings and subcutaneous heparin and early ambulation with a shorter length of stay. Although the incidence of incisional hernia in our series was low (3.5%), this may well be affected by our suboptimal follow-up.
Multisystem organ failure accounted for 11 deaths in our series (73%). In six patients, this resulted from leaks or perforations; in one it followed a bowel obstruction, in two it followed postoperative hemorrhage and in two patients, the cause was never determined. In each of these instances, the complication was identified early and appropriate treatment and supportive care instituted. In four of the patients, the clinical course of SIRS and MSOF was characterized by extremely high temperatures (>105°F), with no apparent source ever identified. To our knowledge, this “syndrome” has not been reported, but may be due to the fact that the enormous adipose tissue stores in these patients may act as a “metabolic sink”, releasing cytokines and other mediators and perpetuating this extreme systemic inflammatory response. Two of the deaths were due to fatal arrhythmias, both in patients with known CAD, who were extensively evaluated preoperatively. The death due to pulmonary embolism occurred after discharge, even though the patient received prophylaxis with both heparin and pneumatic compression stockings in the hospital. The remaining death due to exsanguination was clearly preventable.
Although males were significantly heavier and had higher BMIs than women, sex was not an independent predictor of morbidity. However, the presence of angiographically documented coronary artery disease was particularly ominous in men. Males with angiographically demonstrated CAD were 30 times more likely to die. In women, predictors of death included age and SA, but not CAD. With respect to race, Caucasian males with BMI > 50 and CAD were most likely to die, whereas SA was a predictor in African–American men. There were no predictors in Hispanics. Despite the increased mortality in Caucasian males with CAD, these patients were not candidates for cardiac revascularization and extreme weight loss was the only intervention thought to make a beneficial health impact.

 quotes Robert Brolin, MD, cautioning physicians and the public “...to reconcile the fact that the operation has a real mortality and it will continue to have a real mortality under the best of circumstances. Some of these patients are just profound operative risks for any kind of surgical intervention...The sickest ones are the ones who benefit the most, but they are also the highest risk”.

Conclusion
RYGB can be performed with acceptable perioperative morbidity in patients over a wide range of BMIs. Patients with BMI ≥ 50 have a higher morality for both initial operations and after reexploration. Age, coronary artery disease, and obstructive sleep apnea correlate with perioperative mortality. These three comorbidities were more prevalent in these patients and may contribute to this finding.
