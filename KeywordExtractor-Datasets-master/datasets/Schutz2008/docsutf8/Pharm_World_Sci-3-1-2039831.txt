Objective
To find out if administration of melatonin facilitates discontinuation of benzodiazepine (BD) therapy in patients with insomnia.

Method
A placebo controlled trial in nine general practices in the Netherlands. Long-term users of benzodiazepines were asked by their GP to participate in a discontinuation program in combination with melatonin or placebo. The intervention and follow-up period lasted one year. During this period participants received four questionnaires about their use of sleeping medication and several health instruments. The urine of all participants was tested for the presence of benzodiazepines, as proof of the discontinuation.

Main outcome measure
The discontinuation of benzodiazepine use measured by questionnaires and urine samples at three assessment points.

Results
A total of 503 long-term users were selected by the GPs, of whom 38 patients (16M/22F) participated. After one year 40% had stopped their benzodiazepine use, both in the intervention group on melatonin and in the placebo control group. Comparing stoppers and non-stoppers did not reveal significant differences in benzodiazepine use, or awareness of problematic use.

Conclusion
Our findings do not conclusively indicate that melatonin is helpful for the discontinuation of the use of benzodiazepines, but the average dose of benzodiazepines in the group was low. Further investigation is necessary, with special attention to the possible influence of the daily dose on the facilitation effect of melatonin.

Impact of findings on practice
stopping long-term use of benzodiazepine hypnotics is difficult

users of a high daily dose might be more responsive to the effect of melatonin on the discontinuation of benzodiazepines

investigators should take into account the difficulty of recruiting patients for studies on discontinuing the use of benzodiazepines

] does not support efficacy of melatonin to reduce the use of benzodiazepines in low doses. Forty-five patients were randomized to receive either melatonin (3 mg) or placebo for six weeks. In two steps BD was tapered off and stopped after four weeks. Several sleep parameters were assessed and found not to be different for both groups.
The administration of melatonin as a sleeping medication is a contradictory tool to help people discontinue use of BDs.
Aim of the study
. The main research question in our trial was whether melatonin is helpful in discontinuing the use of BD sleeping medication, looking at the stopping rate. Secondary objectives are finding the possible influence of other variables on stopping, such as age, gender, period of BD use, and dependence on BD. Besides, we investigated a putative shift of addiction, e.g., to alcohol or smoking.

Method
Our study was designed as a randomized placebo-controlled discontinuation trial. We gathered data in nine general practices (2001–2004). The patients, their GPs and the principal investigator were blinded for the study medication. All practices were located in Maastricht, in the south of the Netherlands.

The sleep wake experience list (SWEL) is a validated instrument to study chronic sleep complaints (insomnia, hypersomnia or the combination of those two). The benzodiazepine dependence self-report questionnaire (Bendep-SRQ) is a validated instrument to measure BD dependency, scoring in subscales the degree of awareness of problematic BD use, degree of preoccupation with respect to the availability of BDs, degree of lack of compliance with the therapeutic BD regimen, and the degree of unambiguity of experienced BD withdrawal (Bendep-SRQ, scale 4)

Selection of patients and response/non-response; participants




Receiving the first questionnaire of these 124 patients, 22 did not respond, 56 decided not to participate and eight patients did not meet the inclusion criteria (six of whom had already stopped the BD use). At the end, only 38 participants (16 males and 22 females) were indicated to take part in the study. They were randomly allocated to melatonin or placebo.
The participants compared to the non-participants were more often males (40% vs. 25%), and had a lower age (<50 years, 16% vs. 5%) and less elderly (>80 years, 5% vs. 18%). Of the total group, 76% were 60 years or older.

]. This may be caused by the use of our taper-off program, the selection by some GPs and the selective response, including the awareness of problematic use (in two-thirds of the participants). In general, readiness to stop using BD sleeping medication was low. In our trial we fell well short of the discontinuation rate in the melatonin group of the trial of Garfinkel et al. (14 out of 18).

]. In our trial, 55% of the participants had stopped shortly after the taper off. However, after a year this dropped to 40%. We omitted any supportive measures during follow up as much as possible in order to measure the pure effect of melatonin.

]. For patients with a high daily use melatonin may still be valuable. If there will be future discontinuation trials there is reason to especially include patients who use a high dose of BD.
In our trial, in contrast to that of Garfinkel et al., at the end only 9% still used melatonin. Four participants changed their use to a homeopathic or phytotherapeutic medication, which indicates a basic need to use something for their sleeping problem.
Half of the patients who tried to stop by themselves before participating in our study, without taper off, suffered from withdrawal symptoms. In our trial this was 25%, showing the advantage of gradual tapering. We did not find a shift of addiction behavior, sleep quality or general health among stoppers of BD.

Conclusions
Our trial does not provide conclusive evidence that melatonin is helpful for BD discontinuation.
The overall question about the effectiveness of intervention remains. Another trial, in contrast to the first trial, shows a negative result. One should consider that the results of all three trials are influenced by a possible selection bias or lack of power, due to the low number of participants.
Further investigation is necessary, with special attention to the effect of the daily dose on stopping the use of BD. Finally one should take into account the difficulty of recruiting BD users for stop studies.
