This applies for both mammography and MRI. However the possibility of MRI to evaluate the enhancement pattern and kinetics enables the detection of characteristics suggestive for a malignancy.

] or pre-operative evaluation in the period from July 2000 until November 2006, were included in the study: 23 BRCA1 carriers and 12 BRCA2 carriers. In order to compare tumor characteristics with sporadic cases of breast cancer an age, tumor type and tumor size matched control group was composed from 206 consecutive sporadic breast cancer cases imaged with MRI in the period from November 2001 until January 2007. All BRCA-MC cases were age matched within 5 years with sporadic breast cancer cases. Cases were also matched for tumor type (IDC, ILC or DCIS) and pathological tumor size. For size matching, the BRCA-MC cases were matched to the closest tumor size in the sporadic cases available, with a limit for the maximum size difference of 0.5 cm for tumors smaller than 1 cm, 1-cm difference for tumors up to 5 cm and 1.5-cm difference for tumors larger than 5 cm. BRCA-MC cases that could not be matched following these criteria were excluded.
Mammograms were obtained in the mediolateral oblique and craniocaudal direction on a digital mammographic unit (Senograph 2000 D or a Senograph DS, GE Healthcare, Wis., USA). Detection, density of the lesion compared with breast tissue, lesion morphology, and size were scored. In the morphologic assessment, lesion type was classified as either a mass, a calcifications or as an architectural distortion. Lesion shape was described as rounded, lobulated or irregular and lesion margins as sharp, vague or spiculated. The size of the tumor was measured by determining the longest axis through the displayed lesion. Spiculae surrounding a solid lesion were interpreted as desmoplastic reaction and not included in the measurement.
MRI investigations were performed on a 1.5-Tesla system with a double breast coil (Magnetom Vision, Sonata or Symphony, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). In the scanning, we used a coronally orientated three-dimensional fast low-angle shot (FLASH 3D) with the following parameters: TE 4 ms, TR 8.1 ms, FA 20°, FOV 360 mm, TA 96 s, image resolution 1.5 mm × 1.5 mm × 1.5 mm for all patients scanned prior to June 2004 and TE 4 ms, TR 7.5 ms, FA 8°, FOV 320 mm, TA 87 s, image resolution 1.3 mm × 1.3 mm × 1.3 mm for all patients scanned after June 2004.
Prior to the MR examination, an intravenous catheter was inserted. All patients were placed in the prone position, with the breasts in the double breast coil and positioned at the isocenter of the magnet. After localizer images were obtained in three directions and a precontrast FLASH 3D series was recorded, 0.1 mmol/kg bodyweight gadolinium chelate (Magnevist, Schering, Germany or Dotarem, Guerbet, The Netherlands) was administered using a power injector (Spectris, Medrad, USA) at 2.5 ml/s followed by a 15-ml saline flush at the same injection rate. Thereafter, five post contrast FLASH 3D series were recorded.

] could not be scored objectively and was therefore not included in the evaluation.
All studies were evaluated retrospectively by two radiologists in conference and consensus. BRCA-MCs and controls were mixed during the evaluation. Except from the knowledge of a malignancy being present, the radiologists were blinded to any other clinical information. Mammography and MRI images were evaluated in separate sessions. From the histopathology reports, the tumor type, size and mitotic activity index (MAI) were recorded. The study was approved by the institutional review board; since the study was performed retrospectively, informed consent was not required according to the review board.

P
 values <0.05 were considered to indicate statistical significance.

Results
Six BRCA-MC cases could not be matched according to the criteria defined; these cases were excluded from the study. Four BRCA-MCs were excluded because no match could be found based on patient’s age; the other two were excluded because no match could be found based on tumor size.
The mean age and tumor size of the excluded cases were, respectively, 33 years (range 27–36, median 35, SD 3.4 years) and 1.4 cm (range 0.6–2.8 cm, median 1.1 cm, SD 0.8 cm). A total of 29 BRCA-MC cases were included for this study. In the BRCA-MC group, five women were symptomatic (17%); 21 women were symptomatic in the control group (83%).

 mutation carriers a sensitivity of 64% for the detection of a tumor in the original reports. In this study, 76% of the lesions were visible on mammography. Since this was a retrospective study and the radiologist was aware of the fact that a tumor was present at the time of the evaluation, no conclusion can be drawn from the difference in detection between both studies.

] reported MRI to be more sensitive for DCIS compared with mammography in a prospective study of women with an increased risk for developing breast cancer. Although MRI proved to be more sensitive for the detection of DCIS compared with mammography, not all cases of DCIS were detected by either modality. Therefore, at this point both modalities are still needed in the screening of women with an increased risk for developing breast cancer.

]. What the best strategy in this group of women will be, also in terms of cost effectiveness, needs to be further studied.
We conclude that in BRCA-MC malignant lesions frequently have morphological characteristics that are commonly seen in benign lesions, like a rounded morphology or a sharp delineation. This applies for both mammography and MRI. However, the possibility of MRI to evaluate the enhancement pattern and enhancement kinetics of lesions enables the radiologist to detect characteristics suggestive for a malignancy.
