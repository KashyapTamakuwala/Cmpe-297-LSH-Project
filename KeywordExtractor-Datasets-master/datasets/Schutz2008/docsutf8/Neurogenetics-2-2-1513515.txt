], with different families carrying different combinations of contributing genes. The genes may act independently or interactively, adding to the complexity of determining the genetic contribution to this disorder.
There are two approaches to identifying genetic contributors to disease. The first is a genome wide search in which linkage or association analysis is used to identify regions of the genome that may contain autism susceptibility genes. The second is the candidate gene approach, which investigates a specific gene or genes for involvement in autism risk. In the candidate gene approach, genes are chosen for study based on either what is known about the gene’s function, its location (for example in a recognized linkage peak), or a combination of both. Several candidates are hypothesized to be involved in autism; however, no single candidate gene has consistently emerged as involved in autism risk.

]. Given the high comorbidity of autism with epilepsy and seizures, these data suggest that a similar molecular etiology could exist between the disorders.
Signaling in the GABAergic system is mediated by receptors for the neurotransmitter GABA. There are 19 known GABA receptor subunits arranged in clusters throughout the genome. Functional pentamers formed by various combinations of these subunits result in receptors of varying properties and sensitivities. The amounts and functional capabilities of individual receptor subunits that form a specific pentamer can affect the amount and quality of signaling in different parts of the brain.

In this study, we present a validation of our previous report in an independent dataset of 54 African-American families, as well as confirmation of our previous results in an expanded Caucasian sample of 557 autism families.

]. IQ data was derived from medical records or direct assessment. Exclusion criteria for participation in the larger genetics study included: severe sensory problems (e.g., visual impairment or hearing loss), significant motor impairments (e.g., failure to sit by 12 months, or walk by 24 months), or identified metabolic, genetic, or progressive neurological disorders, based on screening by clinical staff. Additional samples are from the Autism Genetic Research Exchange (AGRE). These individuals were qualified using similar methods including ADI-R, ADOS, VABS, and a standardized measure of IQ.

] were newly identified as Hispanic, and were omitted from the current study in an effort decrease heterogeneity in the Caucasian dataset).
Classification of history of seizure activity in autism patients was based on question 92 from the ADI-R, which queries for both current and lifetime presence of convulsions, seizures, and epilepsy. Caregiver responses to question 92 are coded to indicate no seizure activity, seizure activity with no definitive diagnosis of epilepsy, and seizures with a definite diagnosis of epilepsy. Using lifetime ratings, two groups of families were defined: those in which no seizure activity was reported, and those in which seizure activity was present in at least one autism patient. In addition, question 92 allows for coding of febrile seizures. Families with only febrile seizures were classified as negative for seizure activity and not included in the seizure subset analysis. Both families with positive and negative history of seizure activity were included in our overall dataset. This resulted in a dataset of 41 Caucasian families with a positive history for seizures.

Fluorescence was measured using Applied Biosystem’s 7900. Genotype discrimination was conducted using ABI Prism SDS 2.1 software. Quality control, to ensure accurate genotyping, involved two different CEPH DNAs in quadruplicate on each 384 well plate, as well as the presence of samples which were replicated elsewhere in the sample list. Additionally, ≥95% genotyping efficiency is required.

Although rs2351299 does not have a significant PDT result, it is found in both significant interaction pairs, and in each of the significant three-way interactions.

 in both ethnic groups, different SNPs were found to be associated. The identification of distinct SNPs within these populations may indicate differences in allele frequency and linkage disequilibrium within the two racial groups, differences in the haplotypic background in which identical causative variations originated, or differences in the causative variation. SNP rs16859788 for example, which is significant in the African-American group, shows little variation in the Caucasian dataset, therefore, providing no power for detection of an effect in this group. Other SNPs, however, show similar allele frequencies between the two populations.
Some differences in LD do exist between the two ethnic groups as well; however, the majority of the differences are small. The largest differences in LD are in pairwise values with rs16859788, which appear to mostly be due to the fact that the SNP is practically monoallelic in the Caucasian population. The Caucasian dataset suggests that there is a significant association of SNP haplotypes with autism risk, while the African-American set does not. However, this difference may be due to the small size of the African-American dataset. Therefore, while it appears that minor allele frequency differences can account for the lack of association of rs16859788 in the Caucasian dataset, additional studies are needed to determine whether the other differences in results between the two ethnic groups are due to sample size differences, differential LD with the causative variation in the two populations, or are population-specific risk alleles.
