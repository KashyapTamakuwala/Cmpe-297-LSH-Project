). Furthermore, although there have been other studies of anthocyanin accumulation in lettuce, one of the most popular and commercially important vegetables in the world, this process has not been characterized before at the level of transcriptional regulation. The regulation of anthocyanin accumulation in plants is also a key issue in our understanding of the regulation of leaf color. The identification of the factors that exert this control will provide valuable tools to moderate the extent and distribution of anthocyanin-derived pigmentation in plant tissues.

Materials and methods
Plant materials and growth condition
To investigate the effects of exogenous AtMYB proteins on anthocyanin biosynthesis in lettuce leaves at the molecular level, Jinjachuckmyun plants, supplied by Syngenta (Seoul, Korea), were used. The plants were grown at the National Institute of Agricultural Biotechnology in Suwon, South Korea. Fresh lettuce leaves were plucked from the plants, frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C until required.

Anthocyanin extraction and HPLC analysis
Anthocyanin in the lettuce plants was quantified by HPLC at a detection wavelength of 510 nm, comparing the sample retention times and peaks with those of known standards. The relative quantification of each phenolic compound samples was expressed as the equivalent quantity of purified standards for each treatment.

The lettuce has merit as a model plant system to further characterize the functions of those gene products in anthocyanin metabolism, because of its leaf color is red under field conditions and green under chamber condition when exposed to UV-B irradiation. The findings described in this study further validate the use of lettuce as a model plant because it offers experimental versatility in terms of its genetic regulation of the inhibition of leaf pigmentation. The function of the MYB proteins as activators (green to red in a growth chamber) or repressors (red to green in the field) of anthocyanin biosynthesis can be characterized directly from a phenotypic analysis of the lettuce leaf color. This system has potential applications as a research tool in a number of areas of plant molecular biology.

 gene in anthocyanin biosynthesis, and thus extends the known roles of the R2R3-MYB proteins in secondary metabolism. Evidence from our transgenic lettuce experiments suggests that the direct repression exerted by AtMYB60 protein produces phenotypic effects in transgenic plants. The engineering of the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway is potentially of great commercial significance. Because the AtMYB60 transcription factor should act effectively in most plant species, it can potentially be used to control anthocyanin biosynthesis in agriculturally and industrially important plants. This method of modifying the anthocyanin content in plant tissues also opens up new avenues to engineering improvements in commercial crops by altering metabolic pathways via the regulation of different structural genes in these pathways.
