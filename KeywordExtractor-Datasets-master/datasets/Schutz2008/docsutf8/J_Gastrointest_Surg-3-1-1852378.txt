Preoperative diagnosis of hepatic angiomyolipoma is difficult, and the treatment for it remains controversial. The aim of this study is to review our experience in the treatment of hepatic angiomyolipoma and to propose a treatment strategy for this disease. We retrospectively collected the clinical, imaging, and pathological features of patients with hepatic angiomyolipoma. Immunohistochemical studies with antibodies for HMB-45, actin, S-100, cytokeratin, vimentin, and c-kit were performed. Treatment experience and long-term follow-up results are summarized. During a period of 9 years, 10 patients with hepatic angiomyolipoma were treated at our hospital. There was marked female predominance (nine patients). Nine patients received surgical resection without complications. One patient received nonoperative management with biopsy and follow-up. One patient died 11 months after surgery because of recurrent disease. We propose all symptomatic patients should receive surgical resection for hepatic angiomyolipoma. Conservative management with close follow-up is suggested in patients with asymptomatic tumors and meet the following criteria: (1) tumor size smaller than 5 cm, (2) angiomyolipoma proved through fine needle aspiration biopsy, (3) patients with good compliance, and (4) not a hepatitis virus carrier.

 Many patients have been treated with surgical resection of the tumor. Therefore, the proper treatment of hepatic AML has remained controversial.
The purpose of this study is to retrospectively review the clinical, imaging, and pathological features of patients with hepatic AML treated at our hospital and to summarize our experience in the diagnosis and treatment of this disease. We also review the literature to highlight the important questions concerning hepatic AML: (1) Is hepatic AML a pure benign tumor? (2) What is the natural course of this tumor? Does the tumor size enlarge frequently during observation? (3) What difficulties exist in preoperative diagnosis with imaging studies and fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB)? (4) Is it proper for a hepatitis-carrier patient with hepatic AML to be treated with conservative management? (5) What are the criteria for patients with hepatic AML to be treated with surgical resection or conservative management?

Materials and Methods
The clinical, imaging, and pathological features of 10 patients with hepatic AML treated at the authors’ institute were retrospectively reviewed. The follow-up information was obtained in each case. All tumor tissue was paraffin-embedded for routine hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. Immunohistochemical assays were performed using a three-step indirect peroxidase complex technique with the following antibodies: HMB-45 (DAKO, dilution 1:40), actin (DAKO, dilution 1:50), S-100 (DAKO, dilution 1:800), cytokeratin (Biogenix, dilution 1:80), vimentin (DAKO, dilution 1:50), and c-kit (MBL, dilution 1:200).

Figure 1
A 37-year-old woman (case 3) presented with fever and palpable abdominal mass. (a) The axial view of contrast-enhanced CT scans on portal venous phase shows a huge hepatic tumor at the left hepatic lobe with heterogeneous enhancement. Notice the engorged vessels within the tumor are vividly identified (arrow). (b) The MR coronal Tru FISP, fast imaging with steady-state precession. (TR/TE/FA = 4.3/2.1/72°) shows engorged vessels in the tumor. The right portal vein (arrow) is displaced by the tumor. (c) After 6 months of extended left lobectomy, the abdominal ultrasonography reveals a huge recurrent tumor (arrows) in the previous location of left hepatic lobe, and numerous smaller tumors in the right lobe. (d) Celiac angiography also demonstrates the recurrent huge tumor and other multiple smaller ones in the right lobe of liver. Note the early drainage vein (arrow).



Figure 2
Microscopic appearance of the hepatic angiomyolipoma in case 3. (a) The primary tumor is composed of polygonal to spindle cells arranged in solid sheets or trabecular pattern with endothelial lining. Some of the tumor cells have eosinophilic cytoplasm, and some have large fat vacuoles. Some of the nuclei are bizarre, and some have large eosinophilic nucleoli (H&E stain, original magnification ×100). (b) The tumor cells are strongly immunoreactive for HMB-45 (original magnification ×100). Recurrent tumor was noted 6 months later, and the patient received fine needle aspiration biopsy. (c) Microscopically, it shows tumor cells with clear to ample eosinophilic cytoplasm arranged in trabecular pattern (H&E stain, original magnification ×40). (d) Immunohistochemical staining shows the tumor cells are also positive for HMB-45 (original magnification ×200).

c,d). The clinical and histologic picture demonstrated recurrent malignant hepatic angiomyolipoma. At the 11th postoperative month, chest CT scans revealed multiple metastatic nodules. Three months later, the woman died due to hepatic failure and renal failure.


Discussion

 Flemming also suggested that a proliferation index exceeding 3% and multicentric growth indicate a propensity for recurrence.

 Therefore, hepatic AML should not be considered as an entirely benign tumor; at least, it has malignant transformation potential. Accordingly, conservative treatment should be performed carefully, especially for patients with poor compliance, who are unable to undergo a strict follow-up regimen.

Although hepatic AML seems slow-growing, the probability of tumor enlargement and hence an induced mass-compression effect is not uncommon in the long-term follow-up period. In the present series, the median age of patients was 44 years old, and 70% of patients were below 50 years. If all of these patients had received nonoperative management, the mass effect of tumor enlargement might have been presented during a long-term follow-up period, especially in younger patient groups with longer remaining years of life. Moreover, the difficulties and complications of operation at later years would increase when the tumor enlarges, especially for those patients with an original larger tumor (>5 cm).

 Twenty-one percent (4/19) of patients with a tumor smaller than 5 cm present symptoms/signs; however, the incidence increases to 64% (7/11) when tumor size is between 5 and 10 cm. The incidence increases to 89% when tumor size is larger than 10 cm. In our series, 40% (4/10) of patients were symptomatic, and all four of these patients had a tumor larger than 10 cm. Accordingly, we suggested that patients with tumor larger than 5 cm should receive tumor resection, because most patients in this group were predisposed toward being symptomatic.

 In the present series, only four preoperative cases (40%) were correctly diagnosed by combined imaging studies and FNAB.

19
14
 In Zhong’s series of 2000, none of the 14 cases were correctly diagnosed before operation. Furthermore, five cases were misdiagnosed as hepatocellular carcinoma or sarcoma by pathologists, even after operation. Therefore, we should be cautious when using FNAB as a diagnostic tool.
20
21
 In this series, two patients were carriers of hepatitis B virus with a high risk for hepatoma formation. Not only would these hepatitis-carrier patients bear more risk, but physicians would also bear more risk and psychological pressure during a long-term follow-up period if conservative management were adopted.
Because of the small patient number, we could not get definitely conclusive management suggestions solely from the results of this retrospective study. But a combination of our experience and a review of the literature, we suggest all symptomatic patients should receive surgical resection for hepatic angiomyolipoma. Conservative management with close follow-up is suggested in patients with asymptomatic tumors and meet the following criteria: (1) tumor size smaller than 5 cm, (2) angiomyolipoma proved through fine needle aspiration biopsy, (3) patients with good compliance, and (4) not a hepatitis-virus carrier.
