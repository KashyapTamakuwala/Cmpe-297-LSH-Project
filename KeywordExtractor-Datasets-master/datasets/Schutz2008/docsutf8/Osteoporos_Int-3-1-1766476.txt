Introduction
This study evaluates whether a postoperative multidisciplinary, intervention program, including systematic assessment and treatment of fall risk factors, active prevention, detection, and treatment of postoperative complications, could reduce inpatient falls and fall-related injuries after a femoral neck fracture.

Methods
A randomized, controlled trial at the orthopedic and geriatric departments at Umeå University Hospital, Sweden, included 199 patients with femoral neck fracture, aged  ≥70 years.

Results

Considering the lack of fall prevention studies in hospitals, especially after recent hip fracture surgery, this is an area of interest for study. The aim of this study was thus to evaluate if a postoperative multidisciplinary, multifactorial intervention program could reduce inpatient falls and fall-related injuries in patients with femoral neck fractures.

Methods
Recruitment and randomization
28
].
In Sweden different surgery methods are used depending on the displacement of the femoral neck fracture. In the present study patients with undisplaced fracture were operated on using internal fixation (IF) and patients with displaced fracture were operated on using hemiarthroplasty (HAP). If patients had severe rheumatoid arthritis, severe hip osteoarthritis, or pathological fracture they were excluded, by the surgeon on duty, because of the need for a different surgery method, such as total hip arthroplasty (THA). Patients with severe renal failure were excluded, by the anesthesiologist, because of their morbidity. Patients being bedridden before the fracture occurred were also excluded.

) consented to participate. All patients received the same preoperative treatment. 
Patients were randomized, to postoperative care in a geriatric ward with a special intervention program or to conventional care in an orthopedic ward, in opaque sealed envelopes. The lots in the envelopes were sequentially numbered. All participants received this envelope while in the emergency room but the envelope was not opened until immediately before surgery to ensure that all patients received similar preoperative treatment. Persons not involved in the study performed these procedures.

The geriatric control ward had staffing similar to the intervention ward

Staff education
A 4-day course in caring, rehabilitation, teamwork, and medical knowledge including sessions about how to prevent, detect, and treat various postoperative complications such as postoperative delirium and falls
No specific education before or during the project

Teamwork
Team included registered nurses (RN), licensed practical nurses (LPN), physiotherapists (PT), occupational therapists (OT), dietician, and geriatricians
No corresponding teamwork at the orthopedic unit

Close cooperation between orthopedic surgeons and geriatricians in the medical care of the patients
The geriatric ward, where some of the control group patients were cared for, used teamwork similar to that in the intervention ward

Individual care planning
All team members assessed each patient as soon as possible, usually within 24 h, to be able to start the individual care planning
Individual care planning was used in the orthopedic unit but not routinely as in the intervention ward

Team planning of the patients’ individual rehabilitation process and goals twice a week
At the geriatric rehabilitation unit there was weekly individual care planning

Prevention and treatment of complications
Investigation as far as possible regarding how and why they sustained the hip fracture, through analyzing external and internal fall risk factors
No routine analysis of why the patients had fractured their hips

An action to prevent new falls and fractures was implemented including global ratings of the patients’ fall risk every week during team meetings
No attempt was made to systematically prevent further falls

Calcium and vitamin D and other pharmacological treatments for osteoporosis were used when indicated
No routine prescription of calcium and vitamin D

Active prevention, detection, and treatment of postoperative complications such as delirium, pain, and decubitus ulcers was systematic
Assessments for postoperative complications were made with check-ups for, i.e., saturation, hemoglobin, nutrition, bladder and bowel function, home situation etc., but these check-ups were not carried out systematically as in the intervention group

Oxygen-enriched air during the 1st postoperative day and longer if necessary until the measured oxygen saturation was stable


Urinary tract infections and other infections were screened for and treated


If a urinary catheter was used it should be discontinued within 24 h postoperatively


Regular screening for urinary retention, and prevention and treatment of constipation


Blood transfusion was prescribed if B-hemoglobin  <100 g/l and  <110 for those at risk of delirium or those already delirious


If the patient slept badly, the reason was investigated and the aim was then to treat the cause


Nutrition
Food and liquid registration was systematically performed and protein-enriched meals were served to all patients during the first 4 postoperative days and longer if necessary
A dietician was not available at the orthopedic unit

Nutritional and protein drinks were served every day
No routine nutrition registration or protein-enriched meals were available for the patients

Rehabilitation
Mobilization within the first 24 h after surgery
Mobilization usually within the first 24 h

The training included both specific exercise and other rehabilitation procedures delivered by a PT and OT, as well as basic daily ADL performance training, by caring staff. The patients should always do as much as they could by themselves before they were helped
The PT on the ward mobilized the patients together with the caring staff. The PT aimed to meet the lucid patients every day. Functional retraining in ADL situations was not always given. The OT at the orthopedic unit only met the patients for consultation

The rehabilitation was based on functional retraining with special focus on fall risk factors
The geriatric control ward had both specific exercise and other rehabilitation procedures delivered by a PT and OT, similar to the intervention ward but did not systematically focus on fall risk factors

Home visit by an OT and/or a PT
No home visits were made by staff from the orthopedic unit

However, the inclusion of these variables had only marginal effects on the log-likelihood values of the models as well as on the IRR and HRR values and standard errors for the group allocation variable (intervention or control). In addition, none of the variables showed significant effects on the dependent variable and are therefore not included in the Poisson (Nbreg) and Cox regression analyses.

Discussion
The present study shows that the number of falls and time lapse to first fall can be reduced during in-hospital rehabilitation after a femoral neck fracture. A multidisciplinary, multifactorial geriatric care program with systematic assessment and treatment of fall risk factors as well as active prevention, detection, and treatment of other postoperative complications resulted in fewer patients who fell, a lower total number of falls, and fewer injuries.

]. The method of concealment could have been improved, but one strength was that none from the research team performed this procedure and the envelopes were not opened until the intervention was to begin. Other strengths were the intention to treat analyses, the few patients who refused to participate, and that there were no crossover effects due to staff changing wards during the study period.

The investigation into why the patients had fractured their hip and why they fell may also have influenced the result, as well as the investigation and rehabilitation concerning external fall risk factors such as the use of walking aids, safe transfers, balance, and mobility. It seems that teamwork and individual care planning alone do not have the same effect on falls, as half the falls in the control group occurred in the geriatric control ward, a ward specializing in geriatric patients where teamwork, as well as individual care planning, is applied.

], but the present study allowed the conclusion that at least during the in-hospital stay, this group of patients could benefit from such strategies. The reduced number of falls and injuries also probably contributed to the shorter hospitalization seen in the intervention group. The program seems easy applicable both in the acute postoperative care as well in the post-acute rehabilitation settings and except for the staff education there were no increased costs.
Conclusion
A team applying comprehensive geriatric assessment and rehabilitation, including prevention, detection, and treatment of fall risk factors, can successfully prevent inpatient falls and injuries, even in patients with dementia.
