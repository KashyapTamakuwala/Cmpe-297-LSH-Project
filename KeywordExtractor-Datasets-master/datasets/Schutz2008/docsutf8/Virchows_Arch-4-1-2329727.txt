Expression of the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1), which plays a key role in cellular adaptation to hypoxia, was investigated in normal colorectal mucosa (ten), adenomas (61), and carcinomas (23). Tissue samples were analyzed for HIF-1α, its upstream regulators, von Hippel–Lindau factor, AKT, and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and its downstream targets glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1), carbonic anhydrase IX, stromal-cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1) by immunohistochemistry. In normal colorectal mucosa, HIF-1α was observed in almost all nuclei of surface epithelial cells, probably secondary to a gradient of oxygenation, as indicated by pimonidazole staining. The same staining pattern was present in 87% of adenomas. In carcinomas, HIF-1α was present predominantly around areas of necrosis (78%). Active AKT and mTOR, were present in all adenomas, carcinomas, and in normal colorectal mucosa. GLUT1 and SDF-1 were present in the normal surface epithelium of all adenoma cases, whereas in the carcinoma GLUT1 was located around necrotic regions and SDF-1 was present in all epithelial cells. In conclusion, HIF-1α appears to be physiologically expressed in the upper part of the colorectal mucosa. The present observations support that upregulation of HIF-1α and its downstream targets GLUT1 and SDF-1 in colorectal adenomas and carcinomas may be due to hypoxia, in close interaction with an active phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases–AKT–mTOR pathway.

In addition, the absence of hypoxia prevents HIF-1α from degradation mediated by VHL. When HIF-1α is present, it binds to HIF-1 β in the nucleus. The formed complex activates target genes, like GLUT1, SDF1, and CA IX

The present study aims to analyze the role HIF-1 in normal colorectal mucosa, adenomas, and carcinomas. To this end, the presence of HIF-1α as well as of its downstream targets GLUT1, SDF-1, and CA IX were analyzed in normal colon tissue, colorectal adenomas, and carcinomas. To explore the possible cause of HIF-1 overexpression, i.e., hypoxia or oncogenic stimulation, both the presence of the chemical hypoxia marker pimonidazole and of the HIF-1α upstream regulators, VHL, AKT, and mTOR, were investigated.

Materials and methods
Tumor material
A total of 84 tissue samples were studied, consisting of 61 colorectal adenomas, 20 of which contained already a focus of carcinoma and are therefore referred to as progressed adenomas, in contrast to the 41 adenomas with dysplasia only, which are referred to as nonprogressed adenomas. In addition, 23 colorectal carcinomas were analyzed. These samples were obtained from 75 patients, 37 of which were female and 38 male. Mean age was 67.8 years (range 40–89). Normal mucosa samples were obtained from the resection margins of colectomy specimens from ten patients with colorectal cancer. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board and was in accordance with Dutch medical ethical guidelines.

Determination of hypoxic regions
Hypoxic regions in mouse tissues were visualized using the Hydroxyprobe-1 kit (Chemicon International, Temecula, CA, USA). These experiments were approved by the animal experimentation ethics committee, according to local and governmental regulations.

One case not tested



For CA IX staining, no antigen retrieval step was used. Slides were incubated with a mouse primary antibody to CA IX in a 1:50 dilution for 30 min at room temperature. Detection was performed with the Envision+ system–horseradish peroxidase system for mouse primary antibodies (DAKO).
GLUT-1 staining was performed with a rabbit polyclonal anti-GLUT1 (antibody clone A 3536, DAKO, dilution 1:400) without antigen retrieval and subsequently developed with a standard avidin–biotinylated peroxidase complex (DAKO).
Staining procedures for AKT and mTOR were identical. After antigen retrieval, endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked for 10 min in methanol containing 0.3% hydrogen peroxide. The AKT antibody (Phospho-Akt (Ser473)) and mTOR antibody (Phospho-mTOR (Ser2448)) both obtained from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA, USA) were incubated overnight at 4°C in a 1:50 dilution and subsequently detected with a standard avidin–biotinylated peroxidase complex.
SDF-1 staining was performed similar to the AKT and mTOR staining, except for the secondary antibody, which was a goat anti-rabbit antibody in this case.
For VHL staining, antigen retrieval was performed and endogenous peroxidase was blocked as the AKT and mTOR staining. Primary antibody against VHL was incubated for 60 min by room temperature, followed by Powervision (Immunologic, Duiven, the Netherlands) incubation for 30 min and subsequently the staining was detected with diaminobenzidine (SIGMA FAST™ 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tablets, Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA).
Before the slides were mounted with cover slips, all sections were counterstained for 30 s with Mayer’s hematoxylin and dehydrated in 70%, 96%, and subsequently 100% ethanol and finally in xylene.

In carcinomas, a decreasing gradient of HIF-1α staining was observed from necrotic areas towards the well-vascularized stroma. Besides the epithelial tumor cells, in carcinomas, inflammatory cells in the tumor-associated stroma, and in five cases B-cells in lymph follicles, were positive for HIF-1α. Statistical analysis showed no significant differences in intensity of HIF-1α staining between normal mucosa, adenomas, and carcinomas.

Presence of active mTOR is restricted to the surface epithelium in normal mucosa and adenomas. In adenocarcinomas, cells surrounding necrotic areas show active mTOR as well. In addition, in adenocarcinomas, intracellular localization of mTOR changes from cytoplasm towards cellular membrane staining

The downstream targets of HIF-1, i.e., SDF-1, GLUT1, and CA IX, have predominantly overlapping staining with the presence of HIF-1. However, in normal mucosa, CA IX is not expressed in the HIF-1α positive surface epithelium but is expressed in the basal of the crypts. In adenocarcinomas, SDF-1 is not only present in HIF-1α-positive cells but in all epithelial cells

Discussion
The present study demonstrates the presence of nuclear HIF-1α in the surface epithelium of normal colon and adenomas and in areas associated with peri-necrotic areas of colon adenocarcinoma. The data support a hypoxia-induced HIF-1 cascade, both in normal and neoplastic colorectal mucosa, as suggested by pimonidazole and HIF-1α patterns in association with GLUT1 and SDF-1 in normal colorectal mucosa and adenomas, as well as peri-necrotic HIF-1α and CA IX patterns in colorectal carcinomas. The occurrence of hypoxia around the surface epithelium was confirmed by pimonidazole staining of unaffected murine colon. Furthermore, hypoxia and the oncogenic activation of the AKT–mTOR pathway both contributed to HIF-1 expression in adenomas and adenocarcinomas. Moreover, the expression patterns of CA IX in normal mucosa and SDF-1 in neoplastic mucosa pointed to additional regulations independent from HIF-1.
The hypoxia–HIF-1 cascade

]. The presence of pimonidazole showed a gradient towards the basis of the crypts, suggesting that the cause of hypoxia was indeed related to the anaerobic lumen. Apparently, the capillaries in the surface regions of the colon epithelium were unable to cope with the high oxygen demand of the tissue. This strongly suggests that these hypoxic areas may induce HIF-1α, which contributes to a sustained pressure on the stimulation of angiogenesis and glycolysis to adjust the energy levels of these cells.
Although immunohistochemical analysis of patient samples does not allow a formal analysis of functional relationships, it is highly likely that the HIF-1 detected in normal colorectal mucosa was transcriptionally active because HIF-1α was detected in the nuclei and the HIF-1 downstream targets GLUT1 and SDF-1 were present in the same regions where HIF-1α was found.
In 87% of colorectal adenomas, HIF-1α was present, showing staining predominantly in the nuclei of the surface epithelium. In colorectal adenocarcinomas, the presence of HIF-1α changes from the surface epithelium to epithelium cells surrounding regions of necrosis, indicating severe hypoxia. Presence of HIF-1α in the nuclei of epithelial cells went along with expression of the downstream targets GLUT1 and SDF1 in all different stages of the colon carcinogenesis.

Conclusion
The common expression of HIF-1α in the surface epithelium of the colorectal mucosa suggests that HIF-1 may play a role in the physiology of normal colon tissue. HIF-1α presence does not appear to be related to progression of colorectal carcinogenesis in contrast to GLUT1 and SDF-1, which are expressed more intensely at later stages of this process.
