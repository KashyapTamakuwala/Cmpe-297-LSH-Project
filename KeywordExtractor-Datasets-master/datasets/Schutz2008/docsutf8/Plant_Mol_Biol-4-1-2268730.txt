). This suggests that in barley Zn deficiency induces DMA synthesis in shoots, while both Zn and Fe deficiency induce MAs synthesis and secretion in roots.
The aims of the present study were to examine if the stimulation of MAs secretion by Zn deficiency is common in graminaceous plants and roles of MAs in Zn homeostasis of rice plants. In this report, we shows that DMA secretion is decreased in rice roots, while the concentration of endogenous DMA is increased in Zn-deficient rice shoots.

) and grown in a glasshouse. After 4 days, 270 seedlings were transferred to six 20-l plastic containers containing nutrient solution. After a further 5 days, 90 seedlings were transferred to two 20-l plastic containers containing nutrient solution without Zn followed 7 days later when a further 90 seedlings were transferred to two 20-l plastic containers containing nutrient solution without Fe. All samples were harvested 5 days later for analysis. Consequently, the Zn-deficient treatment was performed for 12 days, and Fe-deficient treatment for 5 days since Fe deficiency has a much more rapid deleterious effect. The nutrient solutions were renewed weekly with adjustment to pH 5.5 every 2 days with KOH.

After collection, Micropur (Katadyn, Switzerland), an antimicrobial agent, was added to prevent microbial degradation of the MAs Both solutions containing root exudates were combined and filtered (Advantec 5C, Toyo Roshi Kaisha, Ltd., Japan).

), graminaceous plants have a common system for Zn translocation within the plant, while the contribution of MAs to Zn uptake from the soil differs among species. Further studies will enable us to understand the mechanism of Zn transport, to manipulate the distribution of Zn in order to produce crops that tolerate Zn-deficient stress, and to enhance the Zn content of crop seeds.
