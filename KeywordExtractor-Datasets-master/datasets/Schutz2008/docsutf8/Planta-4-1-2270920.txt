 (celery). In addition to sucrose, common plantain, sea plantain, and peach also translocated substantial amounts of sorbitol, whereas celery translocated mannitol as well. Sucrose was always present in vacuole and cytosol of mesophyll cells, whereas sorbitol and mannitol were found in vacuole, stroma, and cytosol in all cases except for sea plantain. The concentration of sorbitol, mannitol and sucrose in phloem sap was 2- to 40-fold higher than that in the cytosol of mesophyll cells. Apoplastic carbohydrate concentrations in all species tested were in the low millimolar range versus high millimolar concentrations in symplastic compartments. Therefore, the concentration ratios between the apoplast and the phloem were very strong, ranging between 20- to 100-fold for sorbitol and mannitol, and between 200- and 2000-fold for sucrose. The woody species, peach, showed the smallest concentration ratios between the cytosol of mesophyll cells and the phloem as well as between the apoplast and the phloem, suggesting a mixture of apoplastic and symplastic phloem loading, in contrast to the herbal plant species (common plantain, sea plantain, celery) which likely exhibit an active loading mode for sorbitol and mannitol as well as sucrose from the apoplast into the phloem.

, Plantaginaceae) as well as the corresponding concentrations in the apoplast and in the phloem sap. Celery and common plantain were selected because much of what is known about the transport of mannitol and sorbitol has come from studies of these plant species, and more recently, the relevant transporters for sucrose as well as for sugar alcohols were cloned from these species. In addition, sea plantain and peach were selected because both species also translocate sorbitol but the former belongs to the group of halophytes and the latter to the group of woody plants. In this manner, different groups of sorbitol-translocating plants are included in the comparison. The sugar alcohols and sugars listed above are the main soluble carbohydrates in these plants. Based on the subcellular distribution, we calculated the concentration ratios of soluble carbohydrates between the different subcellular compartments as well as in compartments which are involved in phloem loading. In combination with results from morphological studies and data about sucrose and polyol transporters available in the literature the results are compared to predictions based on models of symplastic and apoplastic phloem loading that are currently discussed in the field.

) was used. This calculation method is based on the assumption that the metabolites are confined to the three compartments as indicated by the corresponding marker enzymes. The evaluation is done by a computer program testing all possible cases for the distribution of a certain metabolite between the three compartments, using increments of 1%; for example: (1) vacuole 100%, stroma 0%, and cytosol 0%; (2) vacuole 99%, stroma 1%, and cytosol 0%; (3) vacuole 99%, stroma 0%, and cytosol 1%. There are 5,151 possibilities for the distribution of a metabolite between the three compartments and the program uses possibility yields to calculate the best fit (agreement) with the experimental results. To avoid the results being falsified by analytical errors, the calculations are based on mean values obtained from measurements of at least five independent density gradient fractionations.

Extraction of sugars and sugar alcohols from non-aqueous fractions
Chloroform:methanol extracts were prepared to extract sugars and sugar alcohols from samples after non-aqueous fraction. The aliquots (see above) were dried and 5 ml chloroform:methanol (3:7, v/v) was added to the powder. The samples were homogenized until completely thawed and kept on ice for 30 min. The homogenate was then extracted twice with 3 ml water. The aqueous phases were combined and evaporated in a rotary evaporator. The dried residue was dissolved in 0.7 ml ultrapure water (Millipore), syringe-filtrated (0.45 μm cellulose-acetate; Schleicher and Schuell, Dassel, Germany) and stored at −80°C.

). The exuding phloem sap (10–500 nl) was collected in micro-capillaries (total volume 0.5 μl) and the volume of the exudate was determined by measuring the length occupied by the solution. Evaporation of the phloem sap was prevented by bringing the front edge of the capillary in close contact with the leaf surface and surrounding the end with a plastic cap. The humidity around the capillary was about 80%. Under these conditions no evaporation from reference capillaries was detectable. The samples were ejected into 50 μl of distilled sterile water and stored at −80°C.

Pulse setting was at 50, 700 and −800 mV for 500, 540 and 540 ms, respectively. Sugar standards were measured daily, and plant samples were diluted sufficiently to provide signals within the linear range of the detector response (50–500 μM). The metabolite amount was calculated from the peak area using Peaknet 5.1 software (Dionex, Idstein, Germany).

Samples were dehydrated by subsequent incubation in higher concentrations of acetone [30, 50, 70, 90 and 100% (w/v)]. The samples were then incubated in an acetone/epoxyresin mix (Spurr 1969) with increasing concentrations of epoxyresin [33, 66 and 100% (w/v)] for 1 h per concentration, and overnight and 4 h at 100% (w/v). Sample blocks were than trimmed with a razor and sectioned in an ultra-microtome (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) with a diamond knife. Slices of approximately 60 nm were placed onto copper grids (Plano, Marburg, Germany), stained with uranylacetate and 0.3% lead citrate in NaOH and observed in a transmission electron microscope (EM 400, Philips, Eindhoven, NL).

Of the compartments analyzed the highest concentration of glucose and fructose was consistently found in the vacuole. As the evaluation of the subcellular fraction was performed in increments of 1%, glucose and fructose concentrations found in the cytosol or stroma represent an upper limit of 1% for these compounds.

). Concentrations were high in all cases, ranging between 200 and 700 mM. In the two Plantaginaceae sucrose concentrations, measured directly, were slightly higher than sorbitol concentrations, whereas in peach and celery the sorbitol and mannitol concentrations, respectively, were 3- and 2-fold higher than the sucrose concentration. Therefore, the ratios of sugar alcohol to sucrose concentrations for the four plants differ between 0.7 in common plantain and 2.8 in peach. No or only traces of glucose and fructose were found in the phloem, and the concentration of myo-inositol was in the low millimolar range (data not shown).

) where up to 100% of sorbitol was found in the vacuole. However, the total leaf content of sorbitol was much lower in snapdragon than in plants in our study. A higher sorbitol concentration in the vacuole than in the cytosol, as in sea plantain, demonstrates that there is an active transport of sorbitol into the vacuole, because most likely sorbitol is either produced in the cytosol or in other cell compartments. So far no sorbitol transporter has been demonstrated to be localized in the tonoplast of mesophyll cells.

The vacuolar mannitol concentration higher in storage petioles than in source leaves may be a reflection of the different functions of these two organs in celery.

Unfortunately, the type of phloem loading in peach is still an open question; the available data are consistent with either an apoplastic or a symplastic mode of loading or, more likely, a combination of both.

The comparison of common plantain, sea plantain, peach, and celery indicates that different modes of phloem loading are employed by different plant families, which may in part be related to the respective ecophysiological requirements.
