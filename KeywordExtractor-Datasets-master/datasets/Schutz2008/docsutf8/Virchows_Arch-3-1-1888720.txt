This study demonstrates the independent prognostic value of the COX-2 expression in resected ICC, thus, offering a potential additional adjuvant therapeutic approach with COX-2 inhibitors.

]. Detailed clinical data was available including preoperative therapy, operative details, and pathological findings including surgical radicability, tumour staging, and clinical follow-up. One patient suffered from primary sclerosing cholangitis without cirrhosis; hepatolithiasis was not present in any case. Data were completed by August 2006, and minimum follow-up was every six months or until death. The median length of the follow-up was 12 months.
Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemistry was performed with an automated staining device (Dako Autostainer, Glostrup, Denmark).

Cyclooxygenase-2
In this study, a monoclonal rabbit anti-human COX-2 antibody (DCS, Hamburg, Germany) was used. Immunohistochemistry was performed on 5-μm-thick paraffin, and antigen retrieval was carried out with 0.01-M citrate buffer at pH 6.1 for 20 min in a hot water bath (95°C). The primary antibody was incubated for 30 min at 1:250 dilution. Antibody demonstration was achieved using the commercially available anti-mouse IgG detection kit (EnVision, DakoCytomation, Carpenteria, CA, USA) The replacement of the primary antibodies by mouse immunoglobin served as negative controls. Positive controls (colorectal carcinoma) were included in each staining series. In ICC, COX-2 was scored according to the amount of positive stained tumour cells. One complete tumour slide was examined for specific cytoplasmic COX-2 immunostaining. If none or less than 10% of the tumour cells showed specific COX-2 immunostaining regardless of staining intensity, the case was classified as negative. The cases with 11–50% of the positively stained tumour cells were classified as moderately positive and tumours with more than 50% stained tumour cells as strongly positive.

Ki67 immunostaining and TdT-mediated dUTP nick-end labelling
Ki67 immunohistochemistry was performed on 5-μm-thick paraffin sections. Dewaxed and rehydrated sections were incubated with hydrogen peroxide to block endogenous peroxidase. After the antigen retrieval in a hot water bath, the prediluted monoclonal anti-Ki67 antibody (Biogenex, San Ramon, USA) was incubated for 30 min; antibody demonstration was performed with the commercially available anti-mouse IgG detection kit (EnVision, DakoCytomation). The replacement of the primary antibodies by mouse immunoglobin served as negative controls.
The growth fraction was defined as the percentage of Ki67-positive, randomly chosen nuclei per 600 tumour cells. In situ DNA fragmentation was established using the terminal desoxyribonucleotide transferase TdT-mediated dUTP nick-end-labelling technique (TUNEL) in paraffin-embedded sections. We used ApoTag™ plus peroxidase in situ apoptosis detection kit (Intergen). The staining procedures were performed according the manufacturer’s recommendations. The percentage of the stained apoptotic tumour cells per 600 randomly chosen tumour cells was calculated. To avoid miscounting of the necrotic cells, corresponding H&E sections were examined.

Statistical analysis
COX-2 immunostaining was assessed by two of the authors (K.J.S., H.R.) in a blind-trial fashion without knowledge of the clinical outcome. In case of disagreement, slides were re-evaluated by both investigators until agreement was reached. All data were converted to a PC and statistically analysed using SPSS version 12 for Windows Statistical Package for Social Sciences, Chicago, IL, USA.

 analysis (or the Fisher’s exact test where patient numbers were small). The relationship between categorical data (e.g. COX-2) and numeric data (e.g. number on Ki-67 positive tumour cells) was determined using the ANOVA test. The overall survival (OS) curves were estimated using the Kaplan–Meier method, and any differences in the survival curves were compared by the log-rank test. For multivariate analysis, the COX regression model was used. Overall, 95% confidence intervals were used throughout.

]. It would be interesting to compare the levels of COX-2 expression in ICC with or without these established associated clinical risk factors. However, our series is not suitable to answer this question because all cases with liver cirrhosis, regardless of its origin, were excluded from our study to maintain the high homogeneity of our cohort and rule out cirrhosis- related influence on patient survival. As a consequence, this series comprises only one patient with associated primary sclerosing cholangitis. Patients with liver fluke infestations and associated hepatolithiasis were not present in this series because our cohort is composed from patients living in western Europe.

In conclusion, this study demonstrates the independent prognostic value of immunohistochemical COX-2 protein expression in resected ICC, thus, offering a potential additional adjuvant therapeutic approach with COX-2 inhibitors and facilitating an optimised therapeutic strategy. Our results suggest that COX-2 overexpression causes a shift towards increased tumour cell proliferation and decreased apoptosis contributing to the unfavourable clinical course.
