. The basic assumption of the latter model, that the scales scatter randomly, was however not specifically demonstrated.
Knowledge of the spatial and spectral reflectance characteristics of single scales is essential to further develop our understanding of the coloration principles applied by butterflies. In the present study we investigate the scattering properties of wing scales of a variety of butterflies, and we correlate the scattering diagrams with the electron micrographs of the scale structure. We show that white scales of pierid butterflies are approximately random scatterers. Iridescent scales, with multilayer structures, exhibit directional reflection. Whereas some butterfly species appear to have scales with dominant iridescence, other species combine iridescence and scattering properties.

b). Angular reflectance curves were calculated for a series of wavelengths with 10 nm interval by sequentially averaging the reflectance spectra over 10 nm wavelength ranges. In addition, the spectral reflectances of single scales were measured with a microspectrophotometer, consisting of a xenon light source, a Leitz Ortholux microscope, and a fiber optic spectrometer. The microscope objective was an Olympus 20×, NA 0.46. A white reflectance standard (Spectralon, Labsphere, North Sutton, NH, USA) served as the reference in all cases.

Post-microtomed samples were contrasted with uranyl acetate in methanol for 2 min and lead in water for 1 min, and were then examined with a Philips 201 transmission electron microscope.

) for both the single scale as for the intact wing piece. The angular width in the vertical plane of the scattering by the single scale is <10°, but the width in the horizontal plane is about 100°. The vertical angular extent of the scattering by the wing piece is about 30°, meaning a broadening of about 20° with respect to the single scale, and the extent in the horizontal plane is similarly broadened






Prof. J. T. M. de Hosson and G. ten Brink (Materials Science Department, University of Groningen) provided essential facilities for scanning electron microscopy, and Dr. H. van der Want together with D. Kalicharan and H. Blaauw (Electron Microscopy Department, Cellular Biology, University of Groningen) provided the support for the transmission electron microscopy. We thank Dr. H. Ghiradella for reading the manuscript and for valuable suggestions. A grant from the University of Osaka, Japan, enabled the research stay of M. A. G. in the Graduate School of Frontier Biosciences in Osaka. A visit to the Royal Museum for Central Africa, Brussels, was supported by the EU via SYNTHESYS. Further financial support was given by the EOARD (Grant 063027).
