Objective
This study examined the relationship between temperament and internalising and externalising problems among children of parents diagnosed with cancer, beyond the effects of socio-demographics, illness-related variables and life events.

Materials and methods
Three hundred and forty adolescent children and their 212 parents diagnosed with cancer participated. Children and parents completed the Youth Self Report and the Child Behaviour Checklist, respectively. Children completed also the Early Adolescent Temperament Questionnaire.

Main results
Daughters of parents with cancer were reported as having more internalising problems than their counterparts did. Prevalence of problems did not depend on children’s and parents’ age or educational level. Recurrent disease and number of life events experienced by children and parents affected the problems reported. The most important temperament dimensions in the prediction of internalising problems in children were shyness and fear/worry, to a lesser extent, frustration and perceptual sensitivity (children only) and lower scores on pleasure intensity (parents only). Externalising problems were associated with effortful control and in children’s reports with frustration. Temperament seemed to be a more important predictor of problems reported by children than parents.

Conclusion
Findings suggest that temperament is useful in determining the relative vulnerability of children of parents who have been diagnosed with cancer. Social workers may help parents to recognise individual differences between children and to support children by using techniques that are compatible with the temperament of children.

]. The primary hypothesis of most models of temperament is that specific dimensions are related to prevalence of specific problems. Research into the role of temperament can provide insight into which children are at greater risk in such situations and which children are better equipped to handle the situation.

]. The model distinguishes between two concepts: reactivity and self-regulation. Reactivity is comprised of the physical and emotional differences that exist among individuals in reaction to stress. Children who have a high degree of reactivity are more easily upset and need more time to recover than other children do. The term “self-regulating system” refers to such processes as attention, activation and inhibition. These processes have an important influence on the regulation of emotions and behaviour. These children may be able to direct attention away from the stressor, such as parental cancer.
To our knowledge, no studies have reported on the effect of different temperament dimensions on the functioning of children of parents who have been diagnosed with cancer. The aim of the current study was to investigate the effects of temperament on prevalence of problems in these children, beyond the possible effects of socio-demographics (age, gender, educational level), illness-related variables (recurrent disease and time since diagnosis) and the number of negative life events that children experienced during the year before assessment.

Materials and methods
Procedure
Between January 2001 and February 2003, written information on this study was offered to all cancer patients who were consecutively hospitalised or who visited the outpatient’s clinic at the University Medical Centre Groningen by their physicians or oncology nurses. In addition, information was sent to patients and their family members who had contacted the researchers in response to media attention because they wished to participate in the study. Families were eligible if patients had been diagnosed between 1 to 5 years before study entry and if they had children between 4 to 18 years of age. Participants had to be fluent in Dutch. Patients discussed study participation with their partners (if present) and children. Informed consent was obtained according to the regulations of the Medical Ethical Committee of the University Medical Centre Groningen. After informed consent was received, questionnaires and prepaid return envelopes were provided.
Participants were guaranteed that answers were treated absolutely confident and will be described completely anonymous.

Participants
The current study is part of a larger study in which 476 families with children aged 4 to 18 years were approached, and information was mailed to 110 families who had contacted us for information about participation. Of these, 205 families from the first group and 89 families from the second group consented to participate (response: 43 and 81%, respectively). Ill parents who did not participate did not significantly differ from those who participated with respect to gender, tumour type and time since diagnosis.
The current study focused on the responses of children of 11 years of age and older, as they completed the questionnaires themselves. The sample for the present study consisted of 340 adolescent children (149 sons and 191 daughters), between the ages of 11 and 18 years (mean age=14.9 years, SD=2.3) and their 212 ill parents (80% mothers, mean age=45.4 years, SD=4.7). Twenty-one percent of the children were receiving education in primary school, 9% at the lower vocational level, 17% in lower general secondary education, 12% in intermediate vocational education, 38% in high school and 3% in higher vocational education or university. Nine percent of the children were from single-parent families. Parents (43 fathers; 169 mothers, mean age=45.4 years, SD=4.7) had been diagnosed with various types of cancer: breast (55%), haematological (9%), skin (9%), gynaecological (9%), urological (5%), bone tumours (4%), gastrointestinal (5%) or other cancers, such as cancer of the central nervous system or head and neck cancer (6%). The mean time since diagnosis was 2.6 years (SD=1.2). Twenty-nine percent of the parents had suffered relapses.

Analyses
Factor analyses of the EATQ-R were executed using Simultaneous Confirmatory Analysis (SCA) and Exploratory Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to investigate factor validity.

, 48]. The differences in perception may have caused also the differences between parents and children found in the present study.
Another interesting result from this study is that, four of the seven temperament dimensions were related to the number of negative life events experienced. This is consistent with Rothbert’s theory, which suggests that, despite its biological base, temperament is influenced by experiences. The influence of stressful environmental factors on the development of temperament is an interesting phenomenon. Because the current study uses a cross-sectional design, no causal statements can be derived from the results.

The fact that temperament of children can have an impact on the prevention of problems by children is important information. Health care providers can use this knowledge to assist parents to take the individual characteristics of the child into account and by means of this to understand their children’s behaviour better. Additionally, parents might be supported to improve the ‘fit’ between the temperament of the child and the consequences of having a parent with cancer.
