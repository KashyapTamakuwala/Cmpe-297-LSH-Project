Background
This study investigates the usefulness of the nonparametric monotone homogeneity model for evaluating and constructing Health-Related Quality-of-Life Scales consisting of polytomous items, and compares it to the often-used parametric graded response model.

Methods
The nonparametric monotone homogeneity model is a general model of which all known parametric models for polytomous items are special cases. Merits, drawbacks, and possibilities of nonparametric and parametric models and available software are discussed. Particular attention is given to the monotone homogeneity model (also known as the Mokken model), and the often-used parametric graded response model.

Results
Data from the WHOQOL-Bref were analyzed using both the monotone homogeneity model and the graded response model. The monotone homogeneity model analysis yielded unidimensional scales for each content domain. Scalability coefficients further showed that some items have limited scalability with respect to the other items in the same scale. The parametric IRT analyses lead to the rejection of some of the items.

Conclusions
The nonparametric monotone homogeneity model is highly suited for data analysis in a health-related quality-of-life context, and the parametric graded response model may add interesting features to measurement provided the model fits the data well.

Introduction
Questionnaires for health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) measurement are important for several reasons. First, they may be used to compare the mean level of different patient groups with respect to physical, mental and social health. A researcher may want to find out whether these patient groups have different needs with respect to, for example, therapy or medication or whether different adaptations of their environment are in order so as to improve their conditions of living. Second, HRQoL questionnaires are also important for the measurement of mean change––either progress or deterioration––of such groups due to, for example, therapy. The researcher’s interest then lies in the effectiveness of therapy with respect to HRQoL. Third, the total score a patient obtains on an HRQoL questionnaire may be used to diagnose this patient’s general level of physical health and psychological well-being, for example, so as to be able to estimate the budget needed for his/her treatment during a particular period.
To effectively measure HRQoL, we argue that an instrument must meet two requirements. The first requirement is that it is clear what the instrument measures: one overall dimension of HRQoL or several dimensions reflecting different aspects of HRQoL. If the instrument measures one dimension, one can use the total score on all items to obtain an impression of the overall level of HRQoL. If the instrument measures multiple dimensions, it may be recommendable to determine total scores on subsets of items (e.g., domain scores), each reflecting a particular aspect of HRQoL (e.g., HRQoL with respect to physical, psychological, and social limitations) and then assess individuals or compare groups on a profile of scores. These two cases may be characterized as unidimensional and multidimensional measurement.
The second requirement is that the psychometric properties of the items are known and found sufficient. One important psychometric item property is the item’s location on the scale that quantifies the HRQoL aspect of interest. For example, patients are likely to experience fewer problems when engaging in activities like bathing and dressing than in more demanding activities such as shopping and travelling. The items concerning bathing and dressing require a lower level of physical functioning than the other two items. Thus, bathing and dressing are located further to the left (at a lower level of the scale) than shopping and travelling. A good diagnostic HRQoL instrument contains items of which the locations are widely spread along the scale. Such a scale allows for measurement at varying levels of physical functioning and may be used, for example, for assessing mean differences between groups, mean change due to therapy, and individual patients’ levels of physical functioning.

], pp. 101–124). A good diagnostic instrument has items with high discrimination power that each contributes effectively to reliable measurement of patients at different locations along the scale. Such an instrument picks up differences between groups, effects of therapy, and individual levels of activity limitation.

].
Our point of view is that, given that the researcher has formulated desirable measurement properties, (s)he should construct his/her scale by means of an IRT model that is as general as possible while satisfying the desired measurement properties. Examples of such properties are that the items measure the same dimension, that the measurement level is at least ordinal, and that measurement values are reliable. An HRQoL researcher who has constructed and pre-tested a questionnaire consisting of, say, 40 items is not served well when his/her data are analyzed by means of an IRT model that is unnecessarily restrictive, the result of which is that, say, half of the items are discarded. We will argue that the most general IRT model that serves one’s purposes well, often (but not always) is a nonparametric IRT model.

Requiring monotone ISRFs only is less restrictive than requiring monotone logistic ISRFs; thus, the MHM is a more general model for describing the data than the GRM (henceforth, we call the nonparametric GRM by its better known name (in fact, acronym) MHM, and the parametric GRM simply the GRM).

This default value ascertains a lower bound on the overall discrimination power of the items (but researchers are free to choose a higher value) and, as a result, item clusters consist only of sufficiently discriminating items that measure the same latent variable. Thus, MSP aims to produce unidimensional scales that allow accurate patient measurement.

The content domains may be considered as unidimensional clusters of items measuring distinct aspects of HRQoL, each of which are related to a more general underlying HRQoL construct. Because of their conceptual clarity, the remaining analyses were done on the a priori defined item domains.

Monotonicity assessment in each item domain
For each item domain, MSP was used to assess the ISRFs’ shapes. First, ISRFs were estimated accurately (i.e., many cases were used to estimate separate points of the ISRFs) but at the expense of possible bias (i.e., only few points were estimated). Second, ISRFs were estimated with little bias (i.e., many points were estimated) but at the expense of accuracy (i.e., few cases were used to estimate each point).

), the nonparametric MHM is highly suited for person measurement.
In an HRQoL context, often little is known about the psychometric properties of new questionnaires. A typical nonparametric MHM analysis explores the dimensionality of the data by capitalizing on model assumptions such as monotonicity (MSP), and studies the shapes of the ISRFs and the ISFs in order to learn more about the (mal-)functioning of individual items (MSP and TestGraf98). This results in scales on which groups can be compared and changes monitored without making unduly restrictive assumptions about the data.
