ErbB receptors (EGFR (ErbB1), ErbB2, ErbB3, and ErbB4) are important regulators of normal growth and differentiation, and they are involved in the pathogenesis of cancer. Following ligand binding and receptor activation, EGFR is endocytosed and transported to lysosomes where the receptor is degraded. This downregulation of EGFR is a complex and tightly regulated process. The functions of ErbB2, ErbB3, and ErbB4 are also regulated by endocytosis to some extent, although the current knowledge of these processes is sparse. Impaired endocytic downregulation of signaling receptors is frequently associated with cancer, since it can lead to increased and uncontrolled receptor signaling. In this review we describe the current knowledge of ErbB receptor endocytic downregulation. In addition, we outline how ErbB receptors can escape endocytic downregulation in cancer, and we discuss how targeted anti-cancer therapy may induce endocytic downregulation of ErbB receptors.

). EGFR is among the most well studied receptors, and it is regarded as a prototype of a signaling receptor that is internalized and degraded following ligand binding. In contrast, surprisingly little is known about endocytosis of ErbB2-4 as well as about EGFR endocytosis following binding of ligands other than EGF. However, it is becoming increasingly clear that the other ErbB receptors do not behave like EGFR regarding endocytosis. In this review we outline the molecular mechanisms of EGF-induced endocytic downregulation of EGFR. In addition, we describe the current knowledge of internalization and downregulation of the other ErbB receptors and discuss how the various ErbB ligands differ in their potential to induce receptor downregulation. Finally, we focus on internalization of these receptors as a promising target in anti-cancer therapy.

Structure of EGFR. In the extracellular part of the receptor, EGFR harbours two domains (L1 and L2) that upon folding form the ligand-binding pocket. Between L1 and L2 is another domain (S1) that includes the dimerization arm. Intracellularly, EGFR has a kinase domain and a C-terminal tail with several amino acid residues that can be phosphorylated. The tyrosine residues (Y) that are involved in Cbl binding are shown. The parts of wild-type EGFR that are deleted in EGFRvIII, EGFRvIV, and EGFRvV are indicated

The signal transduction pathways activated by ErbB receptors include well-known signaling cascades such as the Ras-Erk1/2 pathway, the phospholipase Cγ-protein kinase C pathway, the phosphatidyl inositol 3 (PI 3)-kinase-Akt pathway, and STAT signaling.

). Thus, ErbB receptor endocytosis is not merely a means of turning off activated receptors; it may also be a regulatory mechanism altering the signaling outcome.


Endocytic downregulation of EGFR
Regarding ligand-induced endocytic receptor downregulation, EGFR has been the most popular model system for many years, and the mechanisms of EGFR endocytosis and intracellular trafficking are therefore relatively well understood.

 At the EE vacuolar membrane, EGFR destined for degradation still binds Cbl and is continuously phosphorylated and ubiquitinated. The EGFR ubiquitins are bound by Hrs that resides in at Hrs/STAM/clathrin coat, and this is followed by binding of ESCRT complexes to the ubiquitinated EGFR leading to uptake into ILVs




Sorting of EGFR to clathrin coated pits: ubiquitination or not?
One of the first steps in clathrin-mediated endocytic downregulation is the transport of cargo into CCPs. Despite the importance of regulating whether EGFR is endocytosed, the molecular machinery controlling this is poorly understood.

At present, it remains obscure which mechanisms are responsible for sorting of the activated EGFR to coated pits, although it is clear that Cbl and Grb2 are central, and Eps15 may have important functions. One possible explanation for the apparent contradictory results regarding ubiquitin as an endocytic signal for EGFR is that it is not ubiquitination of EGFR itself but rather ubiquitination of accessory proteins by Cbl that is necessary for EGFR internalization.

In conclusion, although alternative clathrin-independent mechanisms of EGFR endocytosis have been suggested, clathrin-mediated endocytosis still appear to be by far the most important mechanism for EGFR downregulation.

Although it is well established that ErbB2 is severely endocytosis impaired compared to EGFR, there is currently no consensus model of how this is achieved. Taking into account the major focus that ErbB2 receive as an oncogene and as a drug target, a better understanding of the mechanisms hindering ErbB2 endocytosis and lysosomal degradation is warranted.

). Thus, if this is also the case for ErbB3 and ErbB4, the block of receptor degradation seen after proteasomal inhibition could be due to an effect on lysosomal function like the one observed for EGFR. Obviously, this is in discrepancy with the studies reporting that neither ErbB3 nor ErbB4 becomes efficiently endocytosed, and more studies are therefore warranted addressing the role of endocytosis and lysosomal degradation of ErbB3 and ErbB4, not least in cancer cells.

Escape of endocytic downregulation in cancer

). Whether the mutations are the cause of or a result of transformation is often not clear, but some EGFR mutants show increased signaling, which will contribute to oncogenesis. The increased signaling can be the result of constitutive activation and/or impaired downregulation. In this review we will focus on examples of EGFR mutants with impaired downregulation.

Endocytic downregulation of ErbB receptors as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment
Since lack of endocytic downregulation is an emerging theme in ErbB cancer biology, it is evident that stimulation of ErbB endocytosis and lysosomal degradation is an attractive means to inhibit tumor growth.

Indeed, in cases where the anti-tumor effect of therapeutic antibodies is in part due to antibody-dependent activation of an immune response, internalization of bound antibodies will be a therapeutic disadvantage, since it will clear the surface for antibodies that will otherwise be recognized by immune cells such as natural killer cells. However, antibody-mediated receptor endocytosis followed by degradation may be advantageous in the treatment of tumors that rely heavily upon ErbB receptor signaling as a growth-promoting signal.

Perspectives
In spite of its crucial importance both in health and disease, the ErbB receptor system still has hidden secrets regarding its regulation. It is evident that we need to know much more about the molecular mechanisms underlying endocytic downregulation of the otherwise heavily investigated ErbB receptors. One important area that deserves future attention is further mapping of the mechanisms responsible for recruitment of EGFR to CCPs. Moreover, EGFR endocytosis does not seem to be representative of the other ErbB receptor family members, which all appear to be endocytosis impaired to some extent compared to EGFR. It is especially of interest to decipher how formation of heterodimers between the different ErbB receptors affects their endocytic downregulation. In addition, the large number of ErbB ligands adds further complexity to the system, since they may vary in the capability to stimulate endocytosis and lysosomal degradation of their receptors. Interestingly, the few ligands that have been investigated so far differ significantly in their ability to induce endocytic downregulation of ErbB receptors.
More insight into endocytic downregulation of ErbB receptors is indeed relevant for understanding the role of these receptors in cancer, and it could lead to identification of novel targets for cancer therapy directed at downregulating signaling receptors. Although still in the making, the clinical as well as preclinical results show that targeted therapy stimulating endocytic downregulating of ErbB receptors is a promising tool in cancer treatment.
