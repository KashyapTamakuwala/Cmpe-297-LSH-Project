) were derived. The disconnection + callosotomy group showed a lower intercept of the indifference function (implying a higher rate of delay discounting) than the sham-lesioned group; the disconnection group showed a similar but less robust effect, whereas the callosotomy group did not differ significantly from the sham-lesioned group. The results suggest that OPFC–AcbC connections are involved in delay discounting of food reinforcers, but provide no evidence for an involvement of OPFC–AcbC connections in regulating sensitivity to reinforcer size.

, the effects of callosotomy alone, and callosotomy combined with the disconnection lesion were also examined.

Methods
The experiment was carried out in accordance with UK Home Office regulations governing experiments on living animals.
2.1
Subjects
Sixty experimentally naive female Wistar rats (Charles River UK) approximately 4 months old and weighing 250–300 g at the start of the experiment were used. They were housed individually under a constant cycle of 12 h light and 12 h darkness (light on 06:00–18:00 h), and were maintained at 80% of their initial free-feeding body weights throughout the experiment by providing a limited amount of standard rodent diet after each experimental session. Tap water was freely available in the home cages.

: fourteen rats underwent the same surgical procedures as the disconnection-lesioned group, except that the vehicle solution alone was injected into the target sites.

2.3
Apparatus
The rats were trained in standard operant conditioning chambers (CeNeS Ltd., Cambridge, UK) of internal dimensions 25 cm × 25 cm × 22 cm. One wall of the chamber contained a recess into which a peristaltic pump could deliver a 0.6 M sucrose solution. Two apertures situated 5 cm above and 2.5 cm to either side of the recess, through which motor-operated retractable levers could be inserted into the chamber. The levers could be depressed by a force of approximately 0.2 N. A 2.8-W lamp was mounted 2.5 cm above each lever; a third lamp was mounted 10 cm above the central recess. Six red light-emitting diodes were mounted in a row, 4 cm apart, 5 cm above the levers. The operant chamber was enclosed in a sound-attenuating chest; masking noise was generated by a rotary fan. An Acorn microcomputer programmed in Arachnid BASIC (CeNeS Ltd., Cambridge, UK), located in an adjoining room, controlled the schedules and recorded the behavioural data.

 that was longer than the duration of a trial in the sixth block of trials; therefore the number of blocks was limited to five in these phases. The first phase continued for 100 sessions, phase 2 for 50 sessions, and the remaining phases for 40 sessions.
Experimental sessions were carried out 7 days a week, at the same time each day, during the light phase of the daily cycle (between 08:00 and 14:00 h).

2.5
Histology
At the end of the behavioural experiment, the rats were deeply anaesthetised with sodium pentobarbitone, and perfused transcardially with 0.9% sodium chloride, followed by 10% formol saline. The brains were removed from the skulls and fixed in formol saline for 1 week. Forty micrometer coronal sections were taken through the regions of the OPFC and AcbC (approximately from AP +5.0 to AP 0.0) using a freezing microtome.

. Alternate sections were mounted on chrome-gelatine-coated slides and air dried, hydrated by successive immersion in 95, 70 and 50% ethanol, stained in 0.25% cresyl violet for 2 min at room temperature, dehydrated by successive immersion in 50, 70, 95, and 100% ethanol and xylene, and mounted with DPX.

2.6
Data analysis
Data from 5 of the 60 rats were discarded. Histological examination revealed two rats with misplaced excitotoxin-induced lesions; one rat in the disconnection + callosotomy group was discarded because of a failed callosotomy. Data from two further rats were discarded because they showed persistent exclusive responding on one lever. This left 13 rats in the sham-lesioned group, 14 in the disconnection group, 15 in the callosotomy group and 13 in the disconnection + callosotomy group.

: the corpus callosum was completely severed between AP +0.5 to +1.6 in most animals. There was some sparing of the corpus callosum posteriorly (caudal to AP +0.5), possibly reflecting the curvature of the leucotome. Destruction of the callosum was generally accompanied by some ventricular dilatation in the vicinity of the lesion, and the mesial surfaces of the cortex overlying the lesion showed some damage.

, the lesion embraced the ventral (VO) and lateral OPFC (LO), with some involvement of the medial PFC (MO, IL and PrL). In the case of the AcbC lesion, the area of destruction was mainly restricted to the target structure. Some additional damage was inflicted to the ventral portion of the caudate-putamen in some rats; and in some cases NeuN staining revealed a band of neuronal loss in the medial caudate-putamen adjacent to the lateral ventricle. The mesial shell region of the nucleus accumbens was spared. The callosotomy lesion was generally successful in severing the corpus callosum anterior to the caudal margin of the AcbC.
