The aim of the in-situ study was to determine fluoride uptake in non-fluoridated, demineralized enamel after application of fluoride varnishes on enamel samples located at various distances from the non-fluoridated samples. All enamel samples used were demineralized with acidic hydroxyethylcellulose before the experiment. Intra-oral appliances were worn by ten volunteers in three series: (1, Mirafluorid, 0.15% F; 2, Duraphat, 2.3% F and 3, unfluoridated controls) of 6 days each. Each two enamel samples were prepared from 30 bovine incisors. One sample was used for the determination of baseline fluoride content (BFC); the other was treated according to the respective series and fixed in the intra-oral appliance for 6 days. Additionally, from 120 incisors, each four enamel samples were prepared (one for BFC). Three samples (a–c) were placed into each appliance at different sites: (a) directly neighboured to the fluoridated specimen (=next), (b) at 1-cm distance (=1 cm) and (c) in the opposite buccal aspect of the appliance (=opposite). At these sites, new unfluoridated samples were placed at days 1, 3 and 5, which were left in place for 1 day. The volunteers brushed their teeth and the samples with fluoridated toothpaste twice per day. Both the KOH-soluble and structurally bound fluoride were determined in all samples to determine fluoride uptake and were statistically analyzed. One day, after fluoridation with Duraphat, KOH-soluble fluoride uptake in specimen a (=next) was significantly higher compared to the corresponding samples of both the control and Mirafluorid series, which in turn were not significantly different from each other. At all other sites and time points, fluoride uptake in the enamel samples were not different from controls for both fluoride varnishes. Within the first day after application, intra-oral-fluoride release from the tested fluoride varnish Duraphat leads to KOH-soluble fluoride uptake only in enamel samples located in close vicinity to the fluoridation site.

The above-mentioned studies had made clear that fluoride-treated tooth surfaces and salivary fluoride levels are increased after administering local fluoride regimes. Besides these effects, it may be speculated that fluoride applications also lead to fluoride uptake at tooth surfaces that were not directly treated or covered with fluoridation agents such as varnishes. This fact could especially be important for demineralized surfaces, which were inaccessible to direct fluoride application such as inter-proximal areas. Due to toxicological and practical reasons, application of fluoride varnishes is mostly limited to some sites of the dentition. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to determine fluoride transfer from fluoride-varnished enamel surfaces to demineralized enamel surfaces located at various distances from the fluoridation site.

] for a minimum of 2 weeks. Then, all samples were demineralized with acidic hydroxyethylcellulose (pH 4.8, 3 days).
According to this procedure, each two enamel samples were prepared from 30 bovine incisors and each four samples were gained from additional 120 incisors. One sample from each tooth was used for the determination of baseline fluoride content of the respective tooth. The remaining samples of the 30 bovine incisors were later treated according to series 1–3. The remaining samples of the 120 bovine incisors were used for the determination of intra-oral fluoride transfer and acquisition.

Set-up of the study
The study was designed and conducted according to the guidelines of Good Clinical Practice. Ethical approval of the study was granted by the Ethics Committee of the University of Göttingen (2/9/01). Ten panellists (aged 21 to 29 years) participated in the study. They were all residents of Göttingen (fluoride content in domestic water: <0.2 ppm F). The subjects had been instructed to avoid fluoride uptake. The participants had a stimulated salivary fluoride rate within the normal range of 1.0–5.0 ml/min. Further inclusion criteria were that they had at least 20 teeth, no faulty dental restorations, no glass ionomer fillings and no current dental caries activity.
Intra-oral, lower jaw appliances with two buccal aspects were worn by ten volunteers in three series of 6 days each. In each series, one enamel sample was placed for 6 days in one buccal aspect of the appliance after treatment according to the respective series (=central, fluoridated sample). With each five of the participants, the fluoridated samples were placed in the right buccal aspect; with the remaining subjects, the fluoridated samples were fixed in the left aspect of the appliance. A washout phase of 1 week elapsed between the three series.

Each three unfluoridated samples were placed into each appliance at different sites (a–c): (a) directly neighboured to the central, fluoridated specimen (=next), (b) at 1-cm distance (=1 cm) and (c) in the opposite buccal aspect of the appliance (=opposite). These three samples were replaced after 1, 3 and 5 days by new unfluoridated samples, which were removed after 1 day intra-oral exposition. Thus, each one sample was worn at the respective site for the following periods: days 0–1, days 1–2, days 3–4 and days 5–6. The central samples, which were fluoridated on day 0, were not removed from the appliances before completion of the experiment.

They began to use the dentifrice 3 days before the start of the trial. After toothbrushing, the enamel samples in the appliances were carefully cleaned with ten brushing strokes using the toothbrush (impregnated with the remaining dentifrice slurry) that had been used for brushing of the teeth before. A minimum of 8 h elapsed between application of the respective varnish onto the central specimen and first brushing of the samples. During the experiment, the appliances were worn night and day except during meals, during which, they were stored in 0.9% saline.

 structurally bound fluoride) were unstable, not reproducible and showed high standard deviations and coefficients of variation (>20%). Therefore, these readings were regarded as to be “below detection limit”. Thus, fluoride uptake was not calculated by subtracting the baseline fluoride content of the respective tooth, which was below detection limit, from the measured value recorded for the specimen.

]. However, in these samples, structurally bound fluoride was assessed already 1 day after insertion into the appliance. It might be speculated that with longer exposition in the oral cavity, structurally bound fluoride might have been formed by dissolution from the KOH-soluble fluoride deposit.

]. It could, therefore, be assumed that fluoride acquisition of sound enamel surfaces due to fluoride transfer in the oral cavity might be actually more limited as compared to the present results.
Under clinical conditions, a varnish is often applied onto more sites, which might elevate salivary fluoride to a presumably higher extent as in the present study, where the varnishes were applied to a single site only.
Due to the results of the present study, it could be concluded that within the first day after application, intra-oral fluoride release from the tested fluoride varnish Duraphat leads to KOH-soluble fluoride uptake only in demineralized enamel samples, which are located in close vicinity to the fluoridation site. Owing to the negligible transfer of fluoride from the varnish to more remote sites, this finding means, for the clinical situation, that all sites in the oral cavity requiring fluoridation have to be directly treated with the varnish.
