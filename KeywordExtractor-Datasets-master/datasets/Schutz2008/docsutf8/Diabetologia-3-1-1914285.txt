Aims/hypothesis
The thiazolidinedione (TZD) rosiglitazone is a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ agonist that induces adipocyte differentiation and, hence, lipid accumulation. This is in apparent contrast to the long-term glucose-lowering, insulin-sensitising effect of rosiglitazone. We tested whether the action of rosiglitazone involves specific effects on mature adipocytes, which are different from those on preadipocytes.

Materials and methods
Differentiated mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes were used as an in vitro model. Transcriptomics, proteomics and assays of metabolism were applied to assess the effect of rosiglitazone in different insulin and glucose conditions.

Results
Rosiglitazone does not induce an increase, but rather a decrease in the lipid content of mature adipocytes. Analysis of transcriptome data, confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR and measurements of lipolysis, indicates that an altered energy metabolism may underlie this change. The pathway analysis shows a consistent picture dominated by lipid catabolism. In addition, we confirmed at both mRNA level and protein level that rosiglitazone represses adipokine expression and production, except for genes encoding adiponectin and apolipoprotein E. Moreover, transcriptome changes indicate that a general repression of genes encoding secreted proteins occurs.

Conclusions/interpretation
Our findings suggest that the change of adiposity as seen in vivo reflects a shift in balance between the different effects of TZDs on preadipocytes and on mature adipocytes, while the changes in circulating adipokine levels primarily result from an effect on mature adipocytes.

]. A decreased production of these adipokines by TZDs seems to conflict with the adipogenic properties of these drugs.
The above discrepancy could be due to different effects on preadipocytes and mature adipocytes in adipose tissue. It is clear that TZDs stimulate preadipocytes into the process of differentiation. However, their effect on mature adipocytes is less clear. In vivo studies do not allow us to distinguish between the effects on these two cell types. Therefore, to study the effects of TZDs on mature adipocytes, we used in vitro differentiated mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes. In addition to the assessment of lipid accumulation and adipokine secretion, we used transcriptomics to obtain insight into the effects of rosiglitazone. Although high insulin and high glucose levels mimic the situation in vivo when rosiglitazone is administered, we also included low insulin and low glucose levels for comparison.

After staining and washing, the neutral lipid-bound pigment was dissolved in DMSO and absorbance at 540 nm was measured. The staining for 3T3-L1 preadipocytes was used as background to correct for unspecific binding. The obtained absorbance values were further corrected for cell numbers measured in replicated wells. Five independent experiments were performed in duplicate, but in the first two experiments Basal and Rosi conditions were not measured.

Discussion
As a PPARG agonist, rosiglitazone stimulates adipogenesis, which is accompanied by an increasing lipid content of the differentiating cells. However, our results showed that rosiglitazone does not induce an increase of the lipid content, but decreases it in mature adipocytes at high insulin/glucose level. The pathway analysis based on transcriptome data points out that an altered energy metabolism may underlie this phenomenon.

]. Rosiglitazone enhances the pentose phosphate pathway, but inhibits fatty acid biosynthesis, while stimulating other NADPH-dependent pathways, such as glutathione detoxification, cholesterol and steroid biosynthesis, and prostaglandin metabolism (carbonyl reductase 3). The excess of NADPH may be a driving force behind the upregulation of these pathways by rosiglitazone.

], the general repression may correct the disturbance of insulin sensitivity caused by obesity. Furthermore, our transcriptome analysis suggests that rosiglitazone induces a general decrease in expression of genes encoding secreted proteins. This implies a general mechanism, in which energy redistribution might be involved.
