Introduction
We sought to establish whether CT angiography (CTA) can be applied to the planning and performance of clipping or coiling in ruptured intracranial aneurysms without recourse to intraarterial digital subtraction angiography (IA-DSA).

Methods
Over the period April 2003 to January 2006 in all patients presenting with a subarachnoid haemorrhage CTA was performed primarily. If CTA demonstrated an aneurysm, coiling or clipping was undertaken. IA-DSA was limited to patients with negative or inconclusive CTA findings. We compared CTA images with findings at surgery or coiling in patients with positive CTA findings and in patients with negative and inconclusive findings in whom IA-DSA had been performed.

Results
n
n
 = 78). In 31 patients (14%) CTA findings were categorized as inconclusive, and in 60 (27%) CTA findings were negative. One patient received surgical treatment on the basis of false-positive CTA findings. In 17 patients in whom CTA findings were inconclusive, IA-DSA provided further diagnostic information required for correct patient selection for any therapy. Five ruptured aneurysms in patients with a nonperimesencephalic SAH were negative on CTA, and four of these were also false-negative on IA-DSA. On a patient basis the positive predictive value, negative predictive value, sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of CTA for symptomatic aneurysms were 99%, 90%, 96%, 98% and 96%, respectively.

Conclusion
CTA should be used as the first diagnostic modality in the selection of patients for surgical or endovascular treatment of ruptured intracranial aneurysms. If CTA renders inconclusive results, IA-DSA should be performed. With negative CTA results the complementary value of IA-DSA is marginal. IA-DSA is not needed in patients with negative CTA and classic perimesencephalic SAH. Repeat IA-DSA or CTA should still be performed in patients with a nonperimesencephalic SAH.

]. Only after replacement of IA-DSA by CTA can the advantages of CTA be fully realized in the clinical setting. We report here our clinical experience with both 16- and 64-detector row CTA as the first and intended only diagnostic and treatment decision-making study for intracranial aneurysms in patients with acute SAH.

Materials and methods
Subjects
Between April 2003 and January 2006 all patients presenting with a SAH to the University Medical Centre Groningen consecutively underwent CTA as the first diagnostic study. Based on the CTA findings, patients were selected for surgical clipping or endovascular coiling of a ruptured intracranial aneurysm.
SAH was suspected on clinical grounds and confirmed by unenhanced CT or by blood pigments on lumbar puncture.

Imaging protocols
The CT examinations were performed on a 16- or 64-multidetector row spiral CT machine (Somatom Sensation 16 or 64; Siemens Medical Systems, Erlangen, Germany), based on a standard protocol. The 64-multisclice CT was implemented in the Emergency Department in December 2004.
Parameters for 16-slice CT for diagnosis of aneurysm
: via an intravenous cannula in the antecubital fossa, 80 ml of contrast agent (Visipaque 320) was injected with a power injector at a rate of 4 ml/s. Injection of contrast agent was followed by a flush of 50 ml 0.9% saline (Stellant; NaCl Neck Angio) injected at the same rate. A manual fluoroscopic bolus-triggered system, with the internal carotid arteries as reference point and a delay of 4 s, determined the optimal timing. The CTA protocol parameters were as follows: spiral mode, rotation time 0.5 s, reconstruction interval 0.75 mm at Kernel H20, 120 kV/200 mAs, acquisition time 10 s, scan range from the C1 vertebral body to the vertex parallel to the orbitomeatal line.

Parameters for 16-slice CT for diagnosis of SAH
: gantry un-angled, spiral mode, rotation time 0.75 s, 16-detector rows at 0.75-mm intervals, table speed 6 mm/rotation, reconstruction interval 3 mm at Kernel H30 and acquisition parameters 120 kV/200 mAs. The actual acquisition time was approximately 15 s.

Parameters for 64-slice CTA for diagnosis of aneurysm
: rotation time 1 s, table speed 15.4 mm/rotation, reconstruction interval 0.6 mm at Kernel H20, 120 kV/260 mAs, acquisition time 9 s and scan range extending from the C1 vertebral body to the vertex parallel to the orbitomeatal line. The protocol parameters for contrast agent injection remained unchanged.

Parameters for 64-slice CT for diagnosis of SAH
: gantry un-angled, spiral mode, rotation time 1 s, 64 detector rows at 0.6-mm intervals, table speed 9.6 mm/rotation, reconstruction interval 2 mm at Kernel H30, acquisition parameters 120 kV/260 mAs and acquisition time 14 s.



Postprocessing of CTA
Source images were transferred to a remote computer workstation (Odelft Benelux diagnostic imaging) for viewing. Initial careful review of axial images was considered imperative. During this review any areas of concern could be noted. Two-dimensional maximum intensity projection (MIP) views and three-dimensional (3-D) surface-rendered and volume-rendered reconstructions were reformatted from the raw image date on a Vitrea computer workstation by one of the neuroradiologists.

Parameters for IA-DSA and postprocessing
From April 2003 until April 2004 the IA-DSA studies were produced on a digital angiographic unit (Siemens Multiskop with InfiMed image processing) with a 512×512 pixel matrix. From April 2004 onwards the studies were performed on a Siemens Axiom Artis angiographic unit with a 1024×1024 pixel matrix. Selective four- or six-vessel angiography using a standard projection format was performed initially and additional views were obtained if required to identify the parent vessel and aneurysm neck more clearly. The amount of contrast medium (Visipaque 270) used was 8 ml for the internal carotid artery and 6 ml for the external carotid artery, and the injection rate was 6 ml/s when the tip of the catheter was in the internal carotid artery and 3–4 ml/s when the tip of the catheter was in the external carotid artery. The rate of injection into the vertebrobasilar system was 6–8 ml/s to a total amount of 8 ml.
In certain situations, rotational 3-D angiography was performed to better delineate the anatomic details of an aneurysm. Rotational 3-D angiography was performed on a Siemens Axiom Artis angiographic unit. The C-arm rotates in a continuous 200° arc around the patient’s head during a prolonged intraarterial catheter injection of contrast medium (28 ml Visipaque, injection rate 4 ml/s). The raw date images were transferred to a Leonardo workstation (AX Applications) from which 3-D volume-rendered reconstructions were reformatted.


Image review and data analysis
The presence of an aneurysm, its size and morphology, its parent and feeding vessels and the collateral circulation at the circle of Willis were determined by one of the diagnostic or interventional neuroradiologists. If multiple aneurysms were detected, the usual criteria were applied to decide which aneurysm was responsible for the haemorrhage. These criteria included the unenhanced CT findings (distribution of blood) and the size and irregularity of the aneurysm.
All diagnostic findings were discussed with the neurosurgeons. The CTA results were categorized into proven ruptured aneurysm, inconclusive or negative. Patients with a proven ruptured aneurysm were selected subsequently for coiling or clipping. The surgical and endovascular findings were compared to the CTA findings. In general, ruptured aneurysms in the anterior circulation were selected for either coiling or clipping. Ruptured aneurysms located in the posterior circulation were preferably coiled. Giant intracranial aneurysms were preferably treated surgically. A ruptured aneurysm in association with an intraparenchymatous haemorrhage was most often selected for clipping of the aneurysm and surgical evacuation of the haematoma.
Patients categorized as inconclusive or negative underwent IA-DSA. In patients with a perimesencephalic blood distribution, one IA-DSA examination was performed. In patients with a nonperimesencephalic blood distribution a second IA-DSA was performed if the first one was negative. IA-DSA was considered the gold standard. CTA was considered false-negative when IA-DSA revealed a ruptured aneurysm or when rebleeding occurred.
P
 value less than 0.05 were considered significant.
The IA-DSA findings in patients in the inconclusive category were compared with the CTA findings to assess whether IA-DSA actually provided any additional information.

The presence of CT-diagnosed additional asymptomatic aneurysms was checked in 22 patients. These patients had 29 aneurysms. Five aneurysms were confirmed at surgery and subsequently clipped, 5 aneurysms were checked with IA-DSA and subsequently coiled and 19 aneurysms were confirmed with IA-DSA. Three aneurysms in three patients were not verified. In four patients five asymptomatic aneurysms were false-negative on CTA. All were smaller than 5 mm. Four aneurysms were diagnosed with IA-DSA during an embolization session, one of them was also embolized. Another aneurysm was considered a vessel loop of the middle cerebral artery on CTA. However, an aneurysm of the middle cerebral artery was seen during surgery of a ruptured aneurysm of the anterior communicating artery. Clipping of the aneurysm of the middle cerebral artery was also performed.

In 11 patients (35%) IA-DSA confirmed the results of CTA. In 17 patients (55%) IA-DSA was able to give further diagnostic information required for a correct patient selection for therapy. In two patients (6%) no additional diagnostic information could was obtained from IA-DSA. In both patients vasospasm of a vertebral artery resulted in an inconclusive CTA, but also excluded selective catheterization with IA-DSA. A second CTA was negative in both patients. In one patient (3%) treatment selection was based on a false-positive IA-DSA. CTA was inconclusive because of amalgam artefacts in the region of the right posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA). An aneurysm of the right PICA was diagnosed on the first IA-DSA. A second IA-DSA was performed with the intention of coiling. However, with additional views the aneurysm turned out to be a vessel loop.

]. In 11 (85%) of those with negative findings on unenhanced CT, one IA-DSA was done. In one patient a second IA-DSA was performed and in one patient a second CTA was performed. No rebleedings occurred. CTA was true-negative in all these patients.
In 21 patients (70%) with perimesencephalic SAH, IA-DSA was performed once, and in one of them CTA was repeated once and in one CTA was repeated twice. In eight patients IA-DSA was repeated once and in one patient IA-DSA was repeated twice. In this category CTA was true-negative in all these patients. No rebleedings occurred.

). In one of these patients only IA-DSA was able to detect a 3-mm ruptured aneurysm of the anterior communicating artery, and in the other four a rebleeding occurred despite an initially negative CTA and IA-DSA. Repeat angiography was performed in three patients: a ruptured aneurysm was shown by CTA in two and by IA-DSA in one. One patient died before repeat angiography. Two patients were treated successfully. One patient died before treatment due to the direct effect of the rebleeding. The explanations for false-negative results were interpretation mistakes (two aneurysms recognized retrospectively on CTA and IA-DSA), and haematoma demonstrated on CTA surrounding and compressing the aneurysm leading to interpretation error on both CTA and IA-DSA in one patient and on only CTA in another (IA-DSA showed the aneurysm); the findings were uncertain in one patient.

Discussion
Our primary aim was to assess whether CTA is useful clinically in planning and performing clipping or coiling, especially in the acute phase in ruptured intracranial aneurysms, without recourse to IA-DSA. We demonstrated that it was possible to treat more than half of all patients with a ruptured intracranial aneurysm using only CTA. By avoiding conventional angiography, it was possible to streamline the management of ruptured aneurysm during the acute phase. Further, 3D-CTA was able to help in deciding whether to clip or to coil; in only two patients was treatment conversion needed due to incorrect treatment selection based on CTA.

]. In patients with a ruptured aneurysm and intracerebral haemorrhage CTA saves time when aiming for a fast clot removal. Another advantage is that the radiation dosage is low compared to IA-DSA (1.0 mSv at 200 mAs with the CTA Siemens Sensation 16 and 1.8 mSv at 380 mAs with the CTA Siemens Sensation 64 compared with 3.5–6.5 mSv with conventional angiography). Furthermore, the cost of CTA is one-fourth that of conventional angiography.

In five patients with perimesencephalic SAH, IA-DSA as the gold standard control was not performed.



In the present study CTA was false-negative in 8% of patients. The risk of rebleeding after a negative initial CTA was 7%. All false-negatives were in patients with a nonperimesencephalic blood distribution, giving a false-negative rate of 29% and a risk of rebleeding of 24%. It seems unlikely that the false-negative rate of initial CTA and the risk of rebleeding despite a negative initial CTA in patients with a nonperimesencephalic SAH might be influenced negatively by the use of CTA as the first diagnostic tool. Firstly, in all patients with a rebleeding, repeat IA-DSA was also false-negative. Secondly, repeat angiography with CTA performed after a rebleeding still demonstrated an aneurysm.

]. Endovascular treatment is replacing clipping. The use of CTA as the initial investigation for cerebral aneurysms may offset some of this increased workload whilst also improving workflow.
In conclusion, in this evaluation of the use of 16-row and 64-row multislice CTA in the management of ruptured intracranial aneurysms, we demonstrated that CTA can be used as the first-line diagnostic modality for the management of SAH patients. In CTA-negative patients IA-DSA provided no or marginal added value. IA-DSA is not needed in patients with negative CTA and classic perimesencephalic SAH. Repeat IA-DSA or CTA should still be performed in patients with a nonperimesencephalic SAH, due to false-negative CTAs and IA-DSAs in this patient group. The remaining true indication for IA-DSA was in patients with an inconclusive CTA result. In more than half of those IA-DSA provided relevant new diagnostic information.
