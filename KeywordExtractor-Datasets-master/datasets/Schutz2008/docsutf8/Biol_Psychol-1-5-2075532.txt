Abstract
Neuroscience research indicates that individual differences in anxiety may be attributable to a neural system for threat-processing, involving the amygdala, which modulates attentional vigilance, and which is more sensitive to fearful than angry faces. Complementary cognitive studies indicate that high-anxious individuals show enhanced visuospatial orienting towards angry faces, but it is unclear whether fearful faces elicit a similar attentional bias. This study compared biases in initial orienting of gaze to fearful and angry faces, which varied in emotional intensity, in high- and low-anxious individuals. Gaze was monitored whilst participants viewed a series of face-pairs. Results showed that fearful and angry faces elicited similar attentional biases. High-anxious individuals were more likely to direct gaze at intense negative facial expressions, than low-anxious individuals, whereas the groups did not differ in orienting to mild negative expressions. Implications of the findings for research into the neural and cognitive bases of emotion processing are discussed.

Method
2.1
Participants
Spielberger, 1983
); those with trait anxiety scores of 40 or less were allocated to the low anxiety group, and those scoring 50 or more to the high anxiety group. Additional selection criteria were fluency in spoken English and visual acuity within normal limits. Nine volunteers did not complete the study due to equipment calibration problems and six participants had excessive missing eye-movement data (described later). The final sample comprised 28 participants (3 M, 25 F) in the low-anxious group, and 21 (3 M, 18 F) in the high-anxious group.

2.2
Materials and apparatus
The task was administered using MEL2 software (Schneider, 1995), Pentium 450 MHz PC, 15 in. VGA monitor and MEL2 response box. Eye-movements were monitored with 120 Hz infrared pan/tilt eye tracking system (Model 504, Applied Scientific Laboratories, Bedford, Massachusetts) and E5000 software (Applied Science Group, 2000) which was run on a Pentium 333 MHz PC. Testing was conducted in a dimly lit room.

2.3
Procedure
Participants completed a visual acuity check and were seated 1 m from the monitor, with the eye tracking camera positioned 50 cm in front of them, below the right eye. The equipment was calibrated by displaying the numbers 1 to 9 on the screen in a 3 × 3 array and recording the direction of gaze whilst participants looked at each number in turn.
Each trial of the attentional task started with a central fixation-cross shown for 1000 ms, followed by a pair of pictures presented side by side for 500 ms. The pictures measured 90 mm × 110 mm, with their inner edges 45 mm apart. Immediately after the offset of the picture-pair, a probe (pair of dots : or ..) was presented in the position of one of the preceding pictures (visual angle of 7.7° between two probe positions) until a manual response. Participants were asked to press one of two keys as quickly as possible to indicate the type of probe. Inter-trial interval varied randomly between 750 and 1250 ms. Participants were instructed to keep their head still throughout the task and to look at the fixation-cross at the start of each trial. Eye-movement data were recorded from the onset of the fixation-cross until the manual response. There were eight practice trials followed by two blocks, each consisting of two buffer trials and 256 experimental trials, with a short rest-break between the blocks. Across the whole task, the 64 face pairs were presented eight times, balanced for emotional face location and probe location (left vs. right). Trials were presented in a new random order for each participant. If eye calibration quality deteriorated during the task, the task was briefly interrupted to repeat the calibration procedure.

Gaze-direction bias scores were obtained for each participant and each level of intensity of fearful and angry faces by calculating the number of trials in which the first shift of gaze was towards the emotional face, as a proportion of the number of trials in which the initial shift in gaze was made to either the emotional or neutral face (bias scores > .5 reflect an orienting bias towards the emotional face; .5 = no bias).

) so that they would be easier to comprehend, i.e. positive values of bias scores reflect an attentional bias for emotional faces, relative to neutral faces (0 = no bias).
Kolmogorov–Smirnov tests showed that the distributions of RT bias scores and gaze-direction scores were within normal limits.

Discussion
The present findings indicate that fearful and angry faces elicited similar biases in visuospatial orienting. There was a greater tendency for participants to direct gaze initially towards faces with moderate or intense threat-related facial expressions (50–100% intensity), relative to neutral faces, whereas mild threat-related facial expressions (25% intensity) did not elicit a bias in initial orienting. Moreover, visuospatial orienting to both fearful and angry faces was significantly influenced by individual differences in anxiety: high-anxious individuals showed a greater tendency to direct gaze at prototypical (100%) threat-related faces, irrespective of whether the faces depicted fear or anger. The secondary measure of attentional bias, which was obtained from manual RTs, showed a similar pattern of results to that obtained in the eye-movement data.
Mogg and Bradley, 1998; Mogg et al., 2000
). The present results further indicate that high- and low-anxious individuals did not differ significantly in visual orienting to threat-related faces which had weaker emotional expressions. This may explain why some studies might fail to find evidence of an effect of individual differences in anxiety on attentional bias, if they use less salient exemplars of emotional facial expressions than the prototypical faces used here.
Mogg et al., 2000
). Given this previous finding, the present study did not include these additional face types; moreover, these would have made the task too long and fatiguing for participants.

Neutral faces (i.e. 0% emotion intensity) were excluded from this analysis because they cannot be classified as correct or incorrect judgments.
