(Pro)renin receptor-bound prorenin not only causes the generation of angiotensin II via the nonproteolytic activation of prorenin, it also activates the receptor’s own intracellular signaling pathways independent of the generated angiotensin II. Within the kidneys, the (pro)renin receptor is not only present in the glomerular mesangium, it is also abundant in podocytes, which play an important role in the maintenance of the glomerular filtration barrier. Recent in vivo studies have demonstrated that the overexpression of the (pro)renin receptor to a degree similar to that observed in hypertensive rat kidneys leads to slowly progressive nephropathy with proteinuria. In addition, the handle region peptide, which acts as a decoy peptide and competitively inhibits the binding of prorenin to the receptor, is more beneficial than an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor with regard to alleviating proteinuria and glomerulosclerosis in experimental animal models of diabetes and essential hypertension. Thus, the (pro)renin receptor may be upregulated in podocytes under hypertensive conditions and may contribute to the breakdown of the glomerular filtration barrier.

]. In the absence of experimental data showing the blockade of renin signaling by the handle region peptide, we believe that the possible inhibition of receptor signals and angiotensin II generation by the handle region peptide should be interpreted as indicating the blockade of prorenin binding.

], nonproteolytically activated prorenin increased in the kidneys of the diabetic rats, and this increase was inhibited by the handle region peptide. In addition, the renal total renin content remained unchanged during the treatment with the handle region peptide. These results suggested that the handle region peptide inhibits the conformational change in prorenin that leads to prorenin’s enzymatic activation but does not alter the prorenin levels. Because the mRNA expression of cathepsin B, which processes the conversion of prorenin to renin, simultaneously decreased in the kidneys of the diabetic rats, prorenin may have accumulated in their kidneys. Also, the amount of prorenin released to the circulatory system may be elevated in diabetes leading to an elevation in receptor-bound prorenin as a result of the increased prorenin levels with no change in (pro)renin receptor expression.
18
]. Deletion of the angiotensin II type 1 gene attenuated the development of glomerulosclerosis and proteinuria but did not prevent these developments. ACE inhibitor also failed to prevent diabetic nephropathy despite the normalization of renal angiotensin II. On the other hand, the handle region peptide almost completely prevented the development of these conditions despite the absence of an increase in renal angiotensin levels. Of note, MAPKs were markedly activated in diabetic ATKO animals and, while the handle region peptide almost completely inhibited the activation, ACE inhibition failed to even ameliorate it. These results indicate that inhibition of the angiotensin-II-mediated pathway had a little therapeutic effect on nephropathy in the diabetic rats, whereas the blockade of receptor-bound prorenin seemed to suppress the two major pathways for diabetic nephropathy: excessive production of angiotensin II in the kidneys and renal MAPK activation. In this experiment, the renal angiotensin II levels of diabetic mice treated with the handle region peptide were similar to those of untreated wild-type mice. Because the handle region peptide did not seem to inhibit the binding of renin to the (pro)renin receptor, the physiological production of renal angiotensin II induced by renin or receptor-bound renin was probably unaffected by the handle-region-peptide-induced inhibition of receptor-bound prorenin. In addition, the handle region peptide did not influence the plasma levels of renin and prorenin (receptor-unbound free renin and receptor-unbound free prorenin) or blood pressure. Thus, the handle region peptide also had no effect on the physiology of the circulating renin–angiotensin system.
17
]. Diabetes was induced by streptozotosin injection in 4-week-old rats. Increased urinary protein excretion and glomerulosclerosis were observed 12weeks later and the administration of the handle region peptide or vehicle was started. While urinary protein excretion and glomerulosclerosis had progressed in vehicle-treated 28-week-old diabetic rats, treatment with the handle region peptide significantly reduced the proteinuria and glomerulosclerosis from the levels observed at the start of treatment. This reversal of the glomerulosclerosis that had already developed in the diabetic rats suggested that receptor-bound prorenin contributes not only to the onset of nephropathy but also to its progression.
15
]. Thus, high glucose levels may contribute to an increase in the plasma prorenin level via both renal and extrarenal mechanisms, and the elevated plasma prorenin level might trigger an increase in receptor-bound prorenin leading to nephropathy. These mechanisms may explain why the handle region peptide inhibited the development and progression of nephropathy in animal models of diabetes without affecting the high blood glucose level. Further study is needed to clarify these points.

). Namely, when the 39-kDa full-length (pro)renin receptor in the endoplasmic reticulum is released to the cytoplasm, it may divide into a renin-binding part and a remnant part. In the cytoplasm of VSMC and cardiomyocytes, the remaining smaller (pro)renin receptor without the renin-binding part would be capable of binding prorenin but would be incapable of binding renin. However, in the cytoplasm of the mesangium and monocytes, the smaller receptor might readhere to the renin-binding part and resume its ability to bind renin. When the smaller receptor in the cytoplasm reaches the cell membrane, it might further divide into the prorenin-binding part, recognizing the “handle” region, and a remnant part. The prorenin-binding part would be released to the extracellular area and the smallest remnant receptor would remain at the cell membrane. Because the smallest receptor does not contain either the renin-binding part or the prorenin-binding part, it would no longer be capable of binding renin or prorenin. When the prorenin bound to the smaller receptor also reaches the cell membrane, it would divide into three parts: the prorenin prosegment adhered to the prorenin-binding part, renin, and the remaining smallest receptor. Because the former two proteins are released to the extracellular area, angiotensin I generation from external angiotensinogen would occur there. Thus, under cultured cell conditions, the (pro)renin receptor may be fragmented depending on the cell species. Further studies are needed to verify the possible fragmentation of the (pro)renin receptor.

Conclusion
In the glomerulus of the kidneys, the (pro)renin receptor is not only present in the mesangium but is also abundant in the podocytes and its expression was increased by two- to threefold in the kidneys of some animal models of hypertension. A transgene-induced overexpression of human (pro)renin receptor in rats resulted in the development of slowly progressive nephropathy with proteinuria. In addition, the handle-region-peptide-induced inhibition of receptor-bound prorenin significantly inhibited the development and progression of proteinuria in experimental diabetic and hypertensive animal models. Thus, the glomerular (pro)renin receptor appears to play an important role in the regulation of the glomerular filtration barrier.
