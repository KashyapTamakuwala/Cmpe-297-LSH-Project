This paper describes a database for cell signaling enzymes. Our web database 
offers methods to study, interpret and compare cell-signaling enzymes. 
Searching and retrieving data from this database has been made easy and user 
friendly and it is well integrated with other related databases. We believe the 
end user will be benefited from this database.

Background
1
] However, no attempts have been made 
so far to curate and catalog the enzymes involved in cell signaling.
DCSE, the Database of Cell Signaling Enzymes covers a gamut of cell 
signaling enzymes, which includes kinases, phosphatases, adenylyl cyclases, 
caspases, phosphodiesterases, phospholipases, prenyltransferases etc. As 
mentioned above the defect in cell signaling mechanism is the major cause for 
diseases and hence the cell signaling enzymes are considered to be potential 
target in rational drug design approach.

] is an algorithm for comparing biological sequences. Given a library 
or database of sequences, a BLAST search enables a researcher to look for 
sequences that resemble a given sequence of interest. A standalone BLAST has 
been installed and it can be used for similarity search purpose. BLAST can be 
done against SwissProt, DCSE or PD.

Utility to the biological community
Since DCSE gather together all the information on biological molecules, 
sequences, structures, functions, and biological reactions, which transfer the 
cellular signals, this database has the potential of becoming a major hub of 
resource for the biological community. This database provides a mechanism by 
which researchers and students can transform information about interactions 
between biomolecules into knowledge about a cellular process.

Caveats
The database needs to be updated from time to time as the data has been 
obtained from other sources. Despite our efforts to collect information from 
various sources and check them for consistency, the quality of the information 
depends heavily on the original source.

Future development
The coiled-coil structure is important for protein interaction. Since the 
cell signaling also involves protein interaction, a tool to predict coiled-coil 
structure is of importance.
There are few tools for this purpose like MultiCoil. The Multicoil program 
just gives the probability for a residue to be in coiled-coil region. We intend 
to develop a coiled-coil prediction tool based on artificial neural networks 
that could tell whether a residue is in coiled-coil region if it crosses a 
threshold computed from a training set consisting of proteins with known 
coiled-coil structure.
