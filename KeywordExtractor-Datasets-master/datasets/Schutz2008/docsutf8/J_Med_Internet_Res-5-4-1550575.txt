Background
The Web has become an important and influential source of health information. With the vast number of Web sites on the Internet, users often resort to popular search sites when searching for information. However, little is known about the characteristics of Web sites returned by simple Web searches for information about smoking cessation for teenagers.

Objective
To determine the characteristics of Web sites retrieved by search engines about smoking cessation for teenagers and how information quality correlates with the search ranking.

Methods
The top 30 sites returned by 4 popular search sites in response to the search terms "teen quit smoking" were examined. The information relevance and quality characteristics of these sites were evaluated by 2 raters. Objective site characteristics were obtained using a page-analysis Web site.

Conclusions
Using simple search terms on popular search sites to look for information on smoking cessation for teenagers resulted in less than half of the sites being of direct relevance. To improve search efficiency, users could supplement results obtained from simple Web searches with human-maintained Web directories and learn to refine their searches with more advanced search syntax.

The aim of this study was: (a) to identify the characteristics of Web sites with information on smoking cessation for teenagers that ranked in the top 30 positions in a typical Web search on popular search sites and (b) to evaluate the association between those characteristics and the position ranking for sites that are of direct relevance to smoking cessation for teenagers. The findings are relevant for improving consumer access to health information.

Methods
This study was carried out from May 2003 through June 2003. Web sites with information on smoking cessation for teenagers were identified with 4 popular search sites using a specific search term. The characteristics of the identified sites were collected with a Web-site characteristic checklist; 2 raters evaluated each Web site independently (details below).
Search Protocol
Table 1
) were used in this study. Users spend over 5 million search hours per month at each site. A search hour equals the number of visitors to a site multiplied by the average number of hours each visitor is estimated to have spent at the site.

]. For example, in April 2003 there were 40036 searches submitted to Overture with "quit smoking," 27812 with "stop smoking," and 9001 with "smoking cessation." Various other combinations of "teen," "youth," "adolescent," "quit smoking," "stop smoking," and "smoking cessation" were compared. Based on the frequency of searches performed on the Web as recorded by the Overture database, the search terms "teen quit smoking" were submitted to the 4 search sites to locate sites with information on smoking cessation for teenagers.
30
]. Thirty results are equivalent to 3 pages (2 clicks) of the default number of results per page in Google and AOL, 2 such pages (1 click) in MSN, and one and a half such pages (one click) in Yahoo. The results from the 4 search sites were combined into one list to provide an overall picture of the search activity on the Web. The sites were reranked by first grouping the sites into 4 groups by the number of search sites that included them (1 to 4 search sites) and then by the position ranking provided by the search results within each group. The top 30 reranked sites formed the sample for the analysis.

The correlation between the 2 raters ranged from 1.00 for 2 characteristics (presence of phone number or mailing address and presence of material in video or audio format) to 0.19 for indication of sponsorship. The median correlation was 0.69 for the 15 characteristics evaluated by both raters.

Discussion
The key finding of this study was that using simple search terms on popular search sites to look for information on smoking cessation for teenagers, less than half (14 of 30) of the sites found were of direct relevance. The remaining sites were study reports, news, and hyperlinks.

]. Instead, we evaluated only the top 30 search results to mimic typical Web search behavior.

] where 7 out of the top 20 sites were teen pornography sites.
Of public health concern was the finding that 3 sites were commercial sites and 2 of them were linked back to a single online drug store using a page-redirect spamming technique. With page redirection, an optimized page with unique and specific terms is submitted to search sites with the single purpose of ranking high on a specific topic. However, anyone clicking the link to this page is automatically sent to a real destination page, which often contains material unrelated to the initial search terms. For example, one site used "what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-quit-smoking.htm" as the name of its Web page. However, this page contains no information on smoking cessation. Instead, it is a page with a JavaScript that immediately redirects visitors to an online drug store.
Several important associations were found between Web-site characteristics and position ranking in the top 30 search results. These results can be used for optimizing site development in future smoking-cessation Web sites.
Essential-Characteristic Category
As an example of how these results can be used, of the 6 items in the essential-characteristic category, readability (lower grade level) was associated with higher position ranking. The lack of search box, navigational menu, privacy statement, or disclaimer, or the presence of broken links, was not uncommon, but their absence was not associated with lower position ranking.

]. Using the Yahoo! directory, we found 25 sites listed, of which only 4 were found using our search terms at the 4 popular search sites. In addition, users may want to learn and apply the specific syntax of their favorite search sites when searching for information. For example, quit-smoking Web sites of the commercial (.com) domain can be eliminated from the search results by entering "quit smoking -site:.com" in the search box in Google.
