 5.63). The results showed that the quality of interaction between the child and the caregiver was related to the development of play behavior. In particular, security of attachment was related to better play behavior. When the developmental level of the child is taken into account, the attachment relationship of the child with the caregiver at this young age is a better predictor of the level of play behavior than the child's disorder.

This Study
Play behavior in children with autism has been studied before, under various circumstances and on different levels. However, most studies involved subjects older than 42 months of age. The control groups in these studies were mainly subjects matched on mental age (MA), which created substantial differences in chronological age. In this study we investigated play behavior of children with and without ASD, but also of atypically and typically developing controls under the age of 36 months. Several domains of play behavior were analyzed to investigate differences in play behavior between clinical and non-clinical children, and between clinical children with and without ASD. Observing play behavior at this young age provides the opportunity to detect whether the basic play skills of children with ASD are disturbed, or whether the differences appear at a later age when higher levels of play are expected to be shown. We expected the ASD children to lag behind in their level of play behavior already from their first years of life.
Play behavior in children with ASD was also examined in relation to attachment quality. We expected that ASD children with secure attachment relationships would be more playfully engaged and socially involved compared to insecurely attached children with the same disorder. Furthermore, as disorganized attachment is the most insecure type of attachment, it was expected that disorganized children would show more delay in ‘social’ play behavior compared to children without disorganized attachment.

), and pediatric examination and medical work-up. On the basis of all available information, and on the basis of clinical judgment, a diagnosis was given by an experienced child psychiatrist. The inter-rater reliability for two diagnostic categories; ASD or other than ASD was calculated. Agreement among three child psychiatrists (HvE, JB, ED) was reached in 92% of 38 cases. Agreement corrected for chance was 0.74 (Cohen’s Kappa). Agreement for all diagnostic categories was reached in 79% of 38 cases. Agreement corrected for chance was 0.67 (Cohen’s Kappa). Diagnostic discrepancies were resolved at a consensus meeting. If appropriate, children and their parents were offered “care as usual”.

Play Behavior
Play behavior was observed according to protocol. The child and the mother were left in the room for ten minutes. The mother was instructed not to stimulate the child to play but to join when the child asked for cooperation in this free play situation. All children received the same set of toys.

) definitions of symbolic play, only subject substitution was used.
The various play behaviors were categorized in manipulative, functional or symbolic play, and these variables were used in the analyses. The amount of time that a child spent actually playing was calculated as the percentage of time the child played of the total time of the play session. The amounts of time the child performed manipulative, functional and/or symbolic play, were calculated as percentages of the time spent playing. When the child did not play, it would typically show other behaviors such as sitting passively. Reliability among the three coders for play behavior was based on 50% of the videotapes. Agreement was reached in 92% of 38 cases. Mean agreement corrected for chance was 0.74 (Cohen’s Kappa).
The variable ‘level of play’ was calculated based on the three different levels of play behavior; manipulative, functional and symbolic play. Durations of the three kinds of play behavior were included in the calculation with the following formula: ((1 x duration of manipulative play) + (2 x duration of functional play) + (3 x duration of symbolic play)) / total duration of play. Differential weights were thus assigned to the social and cognitive levels of play. The variable ‘change toys’ was based on the frequency per minute the child initiated play with another toy. The preference of toys was measured by calculating which toys were preferred most during play.

Analyses
Play Behavior and Clinical Diagnoses
No gender differences were found for the variables ‘duration of play’, ‘manipulative’, ‘functional’ and ‘symbolic’ play, the ‘overall level of play’ and ‘change toys’. Analyses started with an overall analysis (ANOVA) for all groups, taking differences in developmental level and age into account. Next, differences between the clinical groups with and without ASD were analysed. Preference for toys was investigated using ANOVA for the whole sample, taking differences in developmental level and age into account, and for clinical children with and without ASD.

Contribution of Attachment
To examine whether security of attachment and attachment disorganization contributed to differences in play behavior and preference for toys, analyses with attachment were performed overall, in clinical children and in the group of children with ASD. Play behaviors and preference of toys of children with and without secure attachment, and children with and without disorganized attachment were analyzed.

Discussion
Our findings highlight the importance of attachment in the development of play of children with autism and other developmental disorders. Attachment quality explained play behavior regardless of the clinical status of the children. Taking developmental level of the child into account, we found that children with a secure attachment relationship spent more time playing. They also showed a higher level of play and more symbolic play behavior. Children with a disorganized attachment relationship spent less time playing, and within the group of children with ASD disorganized attachment was related to lower levels of play.

), which contributes to better play outcomes in children with autism. We indeed found that children with secure attachment relationships showed more exploration and higher levels of play, whereas children with disorganized attachment showed less exploration, even after controlling for developmental level. Especially in children with autism the quality of attachment relationship was associated with the development of ‘social’ play.
2001
), we found that children with autism preferred toys that were based on ‘simpler’ play behavior. Children with autism did not prefer daily utensils or books to play with.

) pointed out, the absence of pretend/symbolic play in children with autism may result from assessing individuals who are (mentally) too young to be expected to show pretend/symbolic play. In the current young age group few children showed much symbolic play, and no difference emerged. Fourth, we used ethological measures to observe play behavior in an objective manner, but the context and coherence or patterning of the behavior was not taken into account. A more holistic approach with global ratings of play behavior may uncover differences between children with and without autism.
Limitations of the Study
Although studies of play behavior are required at an early age to get more insight into its development, the young age of the children is also a limitation because symbolic play was not yet in reach of many subjects in the current study. However, retrospective parental reports and screening studies mention differences in play behavior already at this young age. Longitudinal studies are needed to follow the development of these children’s play across time to see whether differences in play behavior arise at a later stage, and to examine whether the effects of a positive attachment relationship are lasting.

Conclusions and Future Research
1993
), studies that indicate a lack of symbolic play behavior in children with autism cannot be seen as convincing proof of the inability of the child to produce this type of play, because MA matched controls would be needed. In our study, we matched the clinical groups both on chronological and on MA. Due to this matching we were able to compare play behavior of children with and without autism. We found no differences in play between children with and without ASD. This may be due to the mental and chronological age of the toddlers included in our study; the lower levels of play behavior typical for this age period may still be within the reach of children with autism. At a later age, children with autism may start to lag behind which might be shown in delayed and infrequent occurrence of symbolic play. We hope to follow-up the current sample to test this interpretation.

) and this approach might not only in the short run but also long-term lead to improvement of quality of attachment as well as level of play behavior in children with autism.
