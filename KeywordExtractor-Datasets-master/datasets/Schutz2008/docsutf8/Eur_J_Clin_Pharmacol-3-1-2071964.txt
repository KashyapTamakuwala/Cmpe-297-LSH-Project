Objectives
The objective of the study was to assess the association between the quality of drug prescribing based on three indicator types derived from the DU90% method and different levels of functioning in pharmacotherapy audit meetings (PTAMs).

Materials and methods
The level of functioning in PTAMs in 2004 was assessed by a standard questionnaire. Data on prescriptions in 2004 by the GPs participating in the included PTAMs were extracted from the database of the Foundation for Pharmaceutical Statistics. Three types of DU90% indicators were computed for the seven mostly prescribed drug classes. With univariate and multivariate analyses of variance, differences in the results of three types of indicators for each of the seven drug classes were assessed according to the levels of PTAMs.

Results
For 84 PTAMs with varying levels of functioning, we found no association between the level of PTAM and the quality of prescribing for any of the indicators within the seven drug classes. In general, results gained of all PTAMs seemed to be high in quality for the aspects measured.

Conclusions
It is difficult to define indicators based on the DU90% method, which can readily distinguish differences in the quality of drug prescribing between PTAMs with different levels of functioning. Indicators for prescribing should specifically meet relevant items in the quality of prescribing for certain drug classes. Items for classification of PTAM levels may need some reconsideration.

]. In this cross-sectional population-based study, we investigated the association between the quality of functioning in PTAMs, categorised into four levels by annual quality assessments, and the quality of prescribing, measured by the DU90% method with first dispensing of participating GPs for three indicator types within the seven mostly prescribed groups of drugs based on dispensing data.

Patients are identified by an anonymous code, gender and year of birth, being the only information of the patient himself. Furthermore, for each dispensing, prescribers can be identified by speciality, and GPs further have an anonymous code.

Drugs of first choice according to the corresponding NHG standard were only suitable for patients without use of NSAIDs. Therefore, for the index of adherence of the antacids, special DU90% segments had to be calculated for all PTAMs, with the additional postulation that only first deliveries of selected GPs were included for those patients who had not had a prescription of a NSAID in the preceding 4 months.

]. PTAMs are expected to come to agreements on the drugs preferred for treatment of certain diseases. As PTAMs functioning on a higher level should be more able to make specific choices and follow these, we expected the number of drugs within a certain group of drugs to decrease with higher levels of PTAMs.

We expected the index of adherence for each group of drugs within the DU90% segment to increase with higher levels of PTAMs.

]. When coming to agreements of drugs to be used preferably, PTAMs are also expected to take costs into account. Comparison between the median costs/DDD within the remaining segment of scarcely prescribed drugs and the DU90% segment for each of the seven drug groups is likely to elucidate in how far the drug choices were also related to costs. As PTAMs on a higher level were likely to succeed better in consistent cost-effective choices, we expected the indicator to be increased with higher levels of PTAMs.





Analyses
Within all three indicator types, mean results (plus standard deviation) for the seven groups of drugs were calculated for each PTAM. With univariate and multivariate analyses of variance (MANOVA), variation between the levels of PTAMs was checked for all indicators of the seven drug groups within all three types of indicators. With MANOVA, analyses could be performed for all seven drug groups within one type of indicator simultaneously, adjusting for the fact that within a type of indicator, the same PTAMs were repeatedly measured for outcome of the seven drug classes. Further, we adjusted for the number of GPs per PTAM in categories from 1 to 10 GPs, 11 to 20 GPs, 21 to 30 GPs and more than 30 GPs per PTAM. All analyses were done with SPSS 12.1 for Windows (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA).

Cost-effective prescribing
The cost per DDD within the DU90% segment on average ranged from 0.14 €/DDD for the benzodiazepine derivatives up to 0.99 €/DDD for the antibacterials for systemic use. In the remaining segment, the cost /DDD varied from 0.22 €/DDD for the benzodiazepine derivatives up to 1.62 €/DDD for the antibacterials for systemic use. The relationship between the cost/DDD of the rest segment and the cost/DDD of the DU90% segment was taken as indicator. A high result indicated a large difference in costs for the drugs seldom dispensed compared to those responsible for 90% of dispensed volume. Except for the group of the oral blood-glucose-lowering drugs (ratio 3.6), the groups had mean ratios between 0.9 and 1.8 for the costs/DDD in the remaining segment divided by the costs/DDD for the DU90% segment.

]. Second, in using the DU90% method, the estimation of segments may need further specification, especially for the aspect of cost effectiveness. As DDDs in general are not always equipotent and may not, in all cases, represent the prescribed daily practice, the costs of the DU90% may be misclassified. For atorvastatin for instance, normally two DDDs are used as daily dosage. Based on the DDD classification, the DU90% volume in our study overestimated the volume of HMGCoA reductase inhibitors and underestimated the costs per effective DDD.

] found to be related with the quality of prescribing, namely to agree on one representative within a PTAM to receive the visitors of the pharmaceutical industry. Evaluation of the classification of PTAM levels of 2004 showed that only half of the PTAMs, being able to make and to evaluate decisions, actually were classified as the highest level. The main reasons for a lower classification were due to the lack of meeting the criteria on the number and duration of meetings. However, PTAMs meeting less than five times per year and being in conference for less than 1.5 h might be quite able to make and fulfil agreements on high quality of prescribing. Thus, the functioning of PTAMs may have been underestimated in our study, which may explain that also PTAMs of lower levels were able to reach high scores in the quality of prescribing.
Another possible explanation could be selection bias caused by the voluntary participation in our study which was quite low. In 2004, there were in total 824 PTAMs in The Netherlands, of which, 14% were in level 1, 43% were in level 2, 20% were in level 3 and 23% were in the highest level 4. Due to our stratified invitation of 50 groups from each level and 57 groups of no classified level, we managed to include sufficient numbers within each level. On average, PTAMs in The Netherlands had 9.6 GPs, comparable to the number of participating PTAMs in our study. Only a quarter of the pharmacists corresponding with one third of the PTAMs invited finally succeeded in participation. Possibly, by this, we included primarily those PTAMs being well organised and with a high level of cooperation regardless of the quality level assessed. The classification into the different PTAM levels might not have created substantial differentiation between participating groups, and this could be an explanation for the fact that the results of our indicators were nearly the same for the different PTAM levels.
A further limitation was our lack of information about the topics that have actually been discussed by the PTAMs in 2004 and earlier. It is possible that PTAMs made agreements on other aspects than the three indicator types chosen. Perhaps, agreements were made on the duration of treatment with antidepressants, on co-medication with HMGCoA inhibitors in patients with diabetes or on usage of new drugs, but as mentioned above, these were not measured by our three indicator types.
In conclusion, it is difficult to define indicators based on the DU90% method that can readily distinguish differences in the quality of drug prescribing between PTAMs with different levels of functioning. Indicators have to be more sophisticated and to meet relevant aspects of the pharmacotherapy within certain drug classes. Items for classification of PTAM levels may need some reconsideration.
