The pathogenesis of MS is unknown. In our studies, we have demonstrated an important role for citrullinated myelin basic protein (MBP). The accompanying loss of positive charge compromises the ability of MBP to interact with the lipid bilayer. The conversion of arginine to citrulline in brain is carried out by an enzyme peptidyl arginine deiminase (PAD) 2. The amount of PAD 2 in brain was increased in MS normal-appearing white matter. The mechanism responsible for this increase involved hypomethylation of the promoter region in the PAD 2 gene in MS, but no change (compared to normal) was found in thymus tissue DNA from the same MS patients. In addition, no change was observed in other neurological diseases, including Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and Huntington’s. We propose that citrullinated MBP, resulting from elevated levels of PAD 2 represents an important biochemical pathway in the pathogenesis of MS.

]. The chemical changes in myelin that precede this destruction are under intensive investigation. In the present overview, we suggest that enzymatic changes induced in myelin basic protein (MBP) may represent an important factor.
The cause of MS is unknown. Two major theories have emerged: an autoimmune or a neurodegenerative cause. The autoimmune etiology is considered to arise from sensitization of T-cells in the periphery by a mechanism of molecular mimicry, usually involving a viral antigen with peptide sequences similar to those found in myelin proteins, especially MBP, a candidate autoantigen in MS. The neurodegenerative hypothesis involves metabolic changes in the myelin constituents, which destabilize the membrane architecture, resulting in myelin degradation. Since the myelin proteins are primarily responsible for maintaining the structure of the membrane we focused our attention on myelin proteins, in particular, modifications that are found on MBP.

), decrease the positive charge. The known modifications are acylation of the N-terminus, GTP binding, ADP-ribosylation (if R25 is not citrullinated), deamidation, methionine sulphoxide, mono, and dimethylation of Arg107, phosphorylation at Ser/Thr residues and Tyr and deimination of arginyl residues (six sites in the 18.5 kDa MBP from normal brain). The structure, shown as a hairpin, occurs at the tri-proline region at the site of the bend. The figure was adapted and modified from Moscarello (1990, Myelin basic protein: a dynamically changing structure.

]. At this time, we speculated that this failure to organize bilayers into compact multilayers, may contribute to myelin instability as seen in MS. These data demonstrated that the citrullinated MBP had a limited ability to organize and compact the lipid bilayers.

] by binding to the polar head groups. This mechanism of interaction is interfered with by deimination of arginyl residues, since the resulting citrulline carries a neutral charge.

]. We postulated that up-regulation of PAD 2 was the primary response. To substantiate this hypothesis, a thorough study was carried out on PAD 2 regulation.

]. In a recently submitted manuscript, we extended our Taxol studies further by demonstrating that the addition of the methyl donor, vitamin B12, suppressed both immune and non-immune demyelinating disease in mice (F. G. Mastronardi et al. 2006, submitted data), better than paclitaxel alone. These data suggest that drugs, which target PAD 2, in the presence of a methyl donor, such as vitamin B12, may be beneficial in demyelinating disease.

], not present in any of the other PAD enzymes. Translocation of the enzyme from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, has been shown to involve the cytokine tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα). The substrate for PAD 4 in the nucleus is histone (F. G. Mastronardi et al. 2006, submitted data). Deimination of arginyl residues of histones decreases the positive charge on histone, which compromises its ability to interact with DNA, possibly resulting in apoptosis of oligodendrocytes. On the other hand, deacetylation of histones would increase the positive charge on histone. Therefore, these two processes, the deimination of arginyl residues and the deacetylation of lysyl residues of histones affect the positive charge on histone in opposite ways, and these two processes may have a regulatory function.
Since we determined that up-regulation of PAD 2, preceded demyelination in the animal model, we searched for the mechanism responsible. An examination of the nucleotide sequence of the PAD 2 promoter revealed that it was high in CpG sequences. CpG sequences are important, because cytosine is a target for methylation by DNA methyltransferase, which produces 5-methylcytosine. Methylation of the promoter region of a gene silences the gene, whereas demethylation increases transcription.

) at cytosines in the CpG island. This demethylated promoter increases transcription of PAD 2, which increases the amount of MBPcit in myelin with subsequent destabilization of the myelin. Degradation of myelin protein fragments, in particular MBPcit fragments, become available to sensitize T-cells in the periphery, initiating the immune response

] we demonstrated that the enzyme in NAWM from MS brain was increased twofold over normal, suggesting the DNA demethylase may have an important role in the hypomethylation of the PAD 2 promoter. Therefore, the hypomethylated state of the PAD 2 promoter may involve up-regulation of the DNA demethylase at least in part.
As a result of the work summarized in this overview, we postulate the following sequence of events during the pathogenesis of MS. The citrullinated MBP, because of its decreased positive charge, prevents proper compaction of the bilayer, so that the multilamellar structure is less stable. Since PAD 2 has been shown to be present in myelin by immunogold electron microscopy (unpublished results), the conversion of non-citrullinated to citrullinated MBP can occur locally in myelin. Preliminary results have shown that immunogold labeling of PAD 2 in mouse optic nerve was not random, but was found in clusters in the axon itself and in the myelin sheath. In the latter, the clusters were found mainly at the junction of the myelin sheath and the axon (periaxonal) with some gold particles distributed in the myelin sheath. The presence of the PAD 2 enzyme at these sites suggests that the citrullinated MBP would be formed in these clusters in myelin, eventually resulting in plaques.
When we examined the extent of labeling in the optic nerve of the spontaneously demyelinating transgenic mouse, we found a threefold increase in the number of gold particles. This increase in PAD 2 labeling demonstrated that increased amounts of PAD 2 were present in the transgenic mouse, accounting for an increase in the citrullinated MBP. Since citrullinated MBP is present in the normal myelin sheath (20% of the total MBP), citrullinated MBP can be tolerated to this extent. However, increased amounts as found in chronic MS (threefold), and in fulminating MS (six to sevenfold), cannot be accommodated in a compact myelin sheath, resulting in destabilization.

], followed by apoptosis. The possible role of the PAD 2 enzyme in this process has not yet been demonstrated. If it can be established that protein deimination at sites of PAD 2 clusters does occur, it may suggest that demyelination begins in the periaxonal myelin sheath and subsequently moves outward. Although this hypothesis is speculative, it warrants investigation. The increased amount of PAD 2 in MS white matter probably reflects a greater production of the enzyme. Since the PAD 2 promoter is rich in CpG islands, we showed that the promoter was hypomethylated. These studies are ongoing in our laboratory. They suggest immediately that the reversal of the hypomethylated state may be a therapeutic target in MS.

], supporting the view that defects in methylation may involve protein methylation as well. The methylation process requires Vitamin B12, which transfers its methyl group to homocyteine synthesizing methionine, which is then converted to S-adenosytmethionine, the methyl donor in all biological methylation reactions, including methylation of cytosine in DNA to methylcytosine. These studies with the preliminary studies reported above suggest an important role for methylation/demethylation reactions in the pathogenesis of MS.
