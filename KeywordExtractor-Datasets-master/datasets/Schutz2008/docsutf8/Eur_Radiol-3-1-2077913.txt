The aim of this study was to determine the feasibility and image quality of dual-source computed tomography angiography (DSCTA) in patients with acute chest pain for the assessment of the lung, thoracic aorta, and for pulmonary and coronary arteries. Sixty consecutive patients (32 female, 28 male, mean age 58.1±16.3 years) with acute chest pain underwent contrast-enhanced electrocardiography-gated DSCTA without prior beta-blocker administration. Vessel attenuation of different thoracic vascular territories was measured, and image quality was semi-quantitatively analyzed by two independent readers. Image quality of the thoracic aorta was diagnostic in all 60 patients, image quality of pulmonary arteries was diagnostic in 59, and image quality of coronary arteries was diagnostic in 58 patients. Pairwise intraindividual comparisons of attenuation values were small and ranged between 1±6 HU comparing right and left coronary artery and 56±9 HU comparing the pulmonary trunk and left ventricle. Mean attenuation was 291±65 HU in the ascending aorta, 334±93 HU in the pulmonary trunk, and 285±66 HU and 268±67 HU in the right and left coronary artery, respectively. DSCTA is feasible and provides diagnostic image quality of the thoracic aorta, pulmonary and coronary arteries in patients with acute chest pain.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the feasibility and image quality of ECG-gated DSCTA of the chest as a tool to evaluate cardiac and non-cardiac causes of acute chest pain in patients presenting to the emergency department.

Materials and methods
Patient population
Sixty consecutive patients (32 females, 28 males, mean age 58.1±16.3 years, age range 26–84 years) were prospectively included in this study. Intake was performed on weekdays from 7 am to 7 pm from August to October 2006. All patients suffered from acute chest pain and were referred to our department to diagnose or to rule out pulmonary embolism (n=56) or aortic dissection (n=4). Inclusion criteria were acute chest pain >5 min within the previous 24 h and/or elevated serum D-dimer levels. Dyspnea and hemodynamic instability were not considered exclusion criteria. Similarly, all patients irrespective of their mean or regularity of heart rate and irrespective of their ability to perform breath-hold were included. Exclusion criteria included pregnancy, previous adverse reaction to iodinated contrast agent, nephropathy (serum creatinine >1.3 mg/dl), elevated troponine-I or creatine kinase-MB level in the initial blood sample, initial diagnostic ECG changes indicating an acute coronary syndrome (i.e., ST elevation or depression >1 mm, T-wave inversion >4 mm in >2 anatomically contagious leads), and interference with standard clinical care of patients. The study was approved by the local ethics committee; informed consent was obtained.

Scan protocol and data reconstruction

Fig. 1
Scan topogram illustrating planning of the chest pain protocol. The scan range covered the entire chest (red box). Premonitoring for bolus tracking was performed at the level of the aortic root (white line). The border for full tube current for the heart and half tube current for the upper lung is set approximately 2 cm below the tracheal bifurcation. It is delimited by a virtual horizontal line connecting the upper ends of the blue boxes on both sides




Retrospective ECG-gating for phase synchronization was used. For the heart, CT data sets were reconstructed at 70% of the R-R interval with a slice thickness of 0.75 mm (increment 0.5 mm) by using a medium soft-tissue convolution kernel (B26f) (mean field of view, FoV: 151±17 mm, image matrix 512×512). If considered necessary, additional images were reconstructed in 5% steps using the same parameters within the time window of full tube current. Images of the mediastinum (mean FoV: 293±43 mm) including the aorta and pulmonary arteries were reconstructed with a slice thickness of 1 mm (increment 0.8 mm) by using a medium soft-tissue convolution kernel (B30f), and images of the lung were reconstructed with a slice thickness of 2 mm (increment 1.5 mm) by using a sharp convolution kernel (B60f, same FoV as for the mediastinum). All images were transferred to a second Wizard (Siemens) equipped with cardiac post-processing software (Syngo Circulation, Siemens).

Data analysis
All data were qualitatively evaluated regarding image quality and artifacts of different thoracic structures by two independent readers who are both experienced in cardiovascular radiology. This evaluation was performed on transverse source images, multi-planar reformations (MPR), curved MPR, and thin-slab maximum intensity projections.

Image quality and artifacts-lung parenchyma
23
]. Lung parenchyma allowing diagnostic assessment due to distinct anatomic details of bronchial and parenchymal structures without significant artifacts and noise was rated with a score of 1 (diagnostic). Lung parenchyma with artifacts or noise causing reduction of image quality and diagnostic value was rated with a score of 2 (non-diagnostic).
1
), the following scores were separately applied for the apex and the basis of the lung, respectively: 1= no artifacts, 2= breathing artifacts (stair step artifacts), 3= ECG-gating (i.e., synchronization or interpolation artifacts), and 4= noise artifacts. If breathing and ECG-gating artifacts appeared at the same time in one patient, the artifact with the worst impact on image quality was noted.

] as used for the rating of the lung parenchyma. Regarding the thoracic aorta, a score of 1 (diagnostic) indicated confident evaluation of the ascending aorta, the aortic arch, and descending aorta. Regarding pulmonary arteries, a score of 1 indicated confident evaluation of central, lobar, segmental, or subsegmental pulmonary arteries. Regarding coronary arteries, a score of 1 represented confident depiction (homogenous attenuation; no artifacts decreasing coronary analysis) of the right coronary artery (RCA), left main artery (LMA), left anterior descending artery (LAD), left circumflex artery (LCX), and their side branches. A score of 2 indicated decreased image quality of thoracic vascular structures with severe impairment of diagnostic value (non-diagnostic) due to breathing, motion, or ECG-gating artifacts.

Image noise and attenuation-vascular structures
24
]. Contrast attenuation was measured in each patient in the ascending aorta, pulmonary trunk, LMA, proximal segment of the RCA, and right and left ventricle. Image noise and contrast attenuation were assessed using a circular ROI positioned exactly within the vessel or ventricular lumen while avoiding superimposition or partial volume effects from the vessel wall or myocardium. Measurements of the ascending aorta and pulmonary trunk as well as of the right and left ventricle were performed on the same transverse image, while the ROI in the coronary arteries was individually placed on separate transverse images.

Imaging findings
Imaging findings indicating the possible underlying cause of acute chest pain were documented in each patient by both readers in consensus.

Statistical analysis

P
-value <0.003 was considered statistically significant.


Results
All CT scans were well tolerated and were successfully performed in all 60 patients without complications. All patients had a sinus rhythm, and the average heart rate during data acquisition was 74.9±19.0 beats per minute (bpm) (range 45-130 bpm). No beta receptor antagonists or benzodiazepines were administered prior to CT; 13 patients (22%) took oral beta blockers as part of their baseline medication at the time of the scan. Mean scan time was 12.2±2.3 s (range 9.7–17.5 s) and mean scan length was 24.1±2.1 cm (range 19.3–29.7 cm). The reconstruction interval used for image reading was 70% of the R-R interval. In seven patients it was considered necessary to reconstruct additional data sets in 5% intervals within the window of full tube current to obtain images with diagnostic quality.
Image quality and artifacts-lung parenchyma
Image quality of lung parenchyma was rated as being diagnostic (score 1) by both readers in all 60 patients (100%; excellent inter-observer agreement, kappa =1.0), and pathology both at upper and lower lung parts could be diagnosed or excluded in all 60 patients.
Lung parenchyma was rated by both readers as being artifact-free in 42 patients (70%). Breathing artifacts causing stair-step artifacts were encountered in nine patients (15%) by one reader and eight (13%) of these nine patients by the other reader (excellent inter-observer agreement, kappa =0.93). Breathing artifacts were exclusively found at the lung base, i.e., at the end of the breath-hold period. ECG-gating-related artifacts were found in ten patients (17%) by one reader, and in nine (15%) of these ten patients by the other reader (excellent inter-observer agreement, kappa =0.84). The two types of artifacts were not encountered in the same patient, and image quality was diagnostic despite the artifacts.

Discussion
Our study demonstrates that DSCT allows performing an ECG-gated chest examination for visualizing the different thoracic vascular territories at the same time-by employing an adjusted contrast media protocol-within a reasonable breath-hold period, and thus provides a diagnostic image quality in almost all patients. One of the most important findings of this study is that diagnostic data of coronary arteries could be obtained without foregoing heart rate control.

]. Third, we did not investigate the optimal contrast media technique for obtaining homogenous contrast attenuation of different thoracic vascular territories. It remains to be determined if the use of the test bolus technique would yield better results with regard to vessel opacification. Finally, it needs to be assessed whether caudo-cranial or caudo-cranial scan direction will result in better image quality.


Conclusion
First experience indicates that DSCTA is feasible in patients with acute chest pain and provides diagnostic image quality of the aorta, pulmonary arteries, and coronary artery system as well as of the lung parenchyma and mediastinum in a patient population without foregoing heart rate control. A dedicated contrast media protocol allows for homogenous attenuation of the different thoracic vascular territories.
