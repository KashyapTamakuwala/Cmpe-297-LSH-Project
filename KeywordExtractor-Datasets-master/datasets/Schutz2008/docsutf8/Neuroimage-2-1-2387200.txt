Abstract
A model of disconnectivity involving abnormalities in the cortex and connecting white matter pathways may explain the clinical manifestations of schizophrenia. Recently, diffusion imaging tractography has made it possible to study white matter pathways in detail and we present here a study of patients with first-episode psychosis using this technique. We selected the corpus callosum for this study because there is evidence that it is abnormal in schizophrenia. In addition, the topographical organization of its fibers makes it possible to relate focal abnormalities to specific cortical regions. Eighteen patients with first-episode psychosis and 21 healthy subjects took part in the study. A probabilistic tractography algorithm (PICo) was used to study fractional anisotropy (FA). Seed regions were placed in the genu and splenium to track fiber tracts traversing these regions, and a multi-threshold approach to study the probability of connection was used. Multiple linear regressions were used to explore group differences. FA, a measure of tract coherence, was reduced in tracts crossing the genu, and to a lesser degree the splenium, in patients compared with controls. FA was also lower in the genu in females across both groups, but there was no gender-by-group interaction. The FA reduction in patients may be due to aberrant myelination or axonal abnormalities, but the similar tract volumes in the two groups suggest that severe axonal loss is unlikely at this stage of the illness.

) has used tractography to study the corpus callosum in patients with chronic schizophrenia, reporting reduced FA in the genu and it also demonstrated the superiority of this method, over ROI studies, in detecting subtle abnormalities across the whole of a white matter tract.
Here we present, to our knowledge, the first study of the corpus callosum (or indeed any white matter pathway) in patients with first-episode schizophrenia spectrum disorders using diffusion imaging tractography. The main aim of the study was to determine whether subtle abnormalities of interhemispheric connections could be detected using this new technique in a group of patients during the first-episode of psychosis, in whom chronicity-related factors could be excluded. We hypothesized that measures of tract coherence (FA), in white matter traversing the genu and splenium of the corpus callosum, would be significantly reduced in the patient group compared to controls.

). Exclusion criteria were the presence of a medical or neurological illness that might impair cognitive function including head injury and alcohol or drug dependency.
Eighteen patients with an initial diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizophreniform or schizoaffective disorder took part in this study. Fifteen of these patients were interviewed again a year later to review the diagnosis, and for the remaining three, who could not be interviewed, a final diagnosis was established also a year later by compiling information from clinicians looking after the patients and by reviewing the clinical notes. Thirteen patients received a final diagnosis of schizophrenia and the remaining five received a diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder (one bipolar, two manic and two depressed subtype). The patients had been ill for a mean of 12.6 months (SD = 19.3 months, range 0–72 months) at entry into the study.

The seed region placement was the only operator-dependent step in the diffusion processing. To assess the inter-rater reliability of the method, a second, independent rater performed the seed region placement in 8 cases, using the same procedure.

The normalization parameters thus obtained were then applied to the binary images of the tract obtained by thresholding the probability images at the level that maximized the difference in FA between patients and controls (see below). After normalization, these images were averaged on a voxel-by-voxel basis, producing a map used to display the degree of tract overlap between subjects within each group.

This method also allows a test of whether region (genu or splenium) or probability thresholds modify the differences in FA between patients and controls. Similar multiple linear regressions were performed to explore gender differences in FA (when adjusting for group membership, age and tract volume) as well as age differences in FA (adjusting for group membership, gender and tract volume).
A voxel-based statistical comparison between CSF maps from patients and controls was performed in SPM2 based on the General Linear Model and Gaussian random field theory incorporating subject age and gender into this model.

Discussion
Our findings provide evidence of altered interhemispheric connectivity in patients with first-episode schizophrenia spectrum disorders. In the patient group, abnormal tract coherence, as measured by reduction in FA, was present in tracts traversing the genu and, to a lesser extent, in those traversing the splenium. Tract coherence, as measured by FA, was lower in females, both in patients and controls, but we failed to find a gender-by-group interaction.
Innocenti et al., 2003
Walterfang et al., 2006
). The corpus callosum develops alongside other midline structures, namely the fornix, hippocampus, septum and cingulate cortex, and developmental or maturational abnormalities involving the corpus callosum are also likely to affect these structures known to play a role in schizophrenia.

) have found no correlation between the presence of white matter abnormalities in first-episode psychosis and exposure to antipsychotic medication. The possible effect of mood stabilizers in explaining our results is likely to be negligible as they were used in only 2 patients.

, in an MRI study of normal subjects, found a larger genu and smaller splenium in men compared with women and attributed the differences to different hormonal influences, to enhanced motor coordination in men (interhemispheric connections crossing the genu) and to greater bihemispheric representation of language in women (tracts crossing the splenium). Adult maturational changes in the corpus callosum, with a peak in the third decade of life, would further accentuate these differences. The differences in age between the two groups are a limitation of the study, although we tried to circumvent the problem using age as a covariate.
Beaulieu, 2002
). In our study the lower FA in the white matter tracts traversing the corpus callosum may be due, in addition to myelin abnormalities, to differences in axonal membranes, alterations in axonal packing density, mean axonal diameter (for example due to a bias towards axons of greater or lesser diameter in one or other group) or a less coherent fiber alignment in the patient group. The similar tract volumes we found in patients and controls may suggest that severe axonal loss is unlikely at this early stage of the illness. On the other hand, the greater variance in genu tract volumes in the patient group suggests that there may be more branching (i.e. less coherence or alignment) in the core of the tract. We have also excluded the possibility that our findings could be related to ventricular enlargement in the patient group.
