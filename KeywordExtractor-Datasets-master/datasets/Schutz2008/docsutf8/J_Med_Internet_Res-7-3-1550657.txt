Background
 To locate online health information, Internet users typically use a search engine, such as Yahoo! or Google. We studied Yahoo! search activity related to the 23 most common cancers in the United States.

Objective
 The objective was to test three potential correlates of Yahoo! cancer search activity—estimated cancer incidence, estimated cancer mortality, and the volume of cancer news coverage—and to study the periodicity of and peaks in Yahoo! cancer search activity.

Methods
 Yahoo! cancer search activity was obtained from a proprietary database called the Yahoo! Buzz Index. The American Cancer Society's estimates of cancer incidence and mortality were used. News reports associated with specific cancer types were identified using the LexisNexis “US News” database, which includes more than 400 national and regional newspapers and a variety of newswire services.

 < .001). Yahoo! cancer search activity tended to be higher on weekdays and during national cancer awareness months but lower during summer months; cancer news coverage also tended to follow these trends. Sharp increases in Yahoo! search activity scores from one day to the next appeared to be associated with increases in relevant news coverage.

Conclusions
 Media coverage appears to play a powerful role in prompting online searches for cancer information. Internet search activity offers an innovative tool for passive surveillance of health information–seeking behavior.

] studied cancer searches conducted using the search engine AskJeeves during a 3-month period and found the most commonly searched cancers were digestive/gastrointestinal/bowel, breast, and skin. This study also compared the incidence of selected cancers with their associated search activity. While this relationship was not statistically tested, the authors observed that some rarer cancers constituted a higher proportion of total searches than their proportion of total cancer incidence. In addition, Bader and Theofanos, as well as Phillipov and Phillips, noted that media coverage appeared to prompt Internet searches for health topics, but they did not systematically investigate or test the relationship.
The study reported here builds on this prior work by analyzing cancer-related searches conducted in the United States from 2001 to 2003 using the search engine Yahoo! Specifically, we investigated three potential correlates of Yahoo! cancer search activity—estimated cancer incidence, estimated cancer mortality, and the volume of cancer news coverage. Cancers that afflicted more individuals, claimed more lives, and generated more news coverage were expected to be associated with more Internet search activity than other cancers, given the interest generated by relevance and publicity. In addition, we assessed the periodicity of Yahoo! cancer search activity and examined sharp increases in Yahoo! search activity related to specific cancer types.

Methods
This analysis included three types of 2001–2003 US data: Yahoo! cancer search activity, cancer burden (estimated incidence and mortality), and cancer news coverage. The study protocol was reviewed by the Institutional Review Board of the National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion and was designated as “research not involving human subjects.”
Yahoo! Cancer Search Activity

].

]. This index provides a search activity score for individual search terms—the words or characters that users type into the Yahoo! search box. Each point of a Yahoo! Buzz Index score equals 0.001% of users searching Yahoo! during the time period of interest (day, week, or month). For example, if 250 out of a total of 1 million users searched for “breast cancer” on January 1, 2001, the Yahoo! “breast cancer” search activity score on this day would be 25 (250/1 million × 100000). For a search term to register a search activity score, it must generate at least 50 searches during the time period for which the score is calculated. Yahoo! search activity generated by search terms can be segmented by country, US state, or selected US cities. This study used daily US Yahoo! search activity data from January 1, 2001 (the earliest date for which Yahoo! search activity data are available) to December 31, 2003. We limited our analysis to Yahoo! searches because at the time of this study no other Internet search engine offered a dataset like the Yahoo! Buzz Index, which provides search activity scores adjusted for the size of the population searching for online information.
Yahoo! employs professional “surfers” or content indexers who manually classify Web pages into one of more than 2000 content categories, such as “movies,” “footwear,” “astrology,” or “cancer or neoplasms.” The Yahoo! Buzz Index classifies search terms in the same content category as the first Web page link that a user “clicks” or activates after conducting a search. For instance, if a user entered the search term “colon” and then clicked on a cancer website, “colon” would be classified as a “cancer or neoplasms” search term. If the user clicked on a grammar website, however, “colon” in that instance would be classified as an “education” search term. When a user does not click on a Web page link or when a user clicks on a Web page link that has not been classified, the Yahoo! Buzz Index categorizes the search term using a variety of algorithms that analyze recent content viewed by the user.
Table 1
). The remaining 53 terms were discarded because they did not relate to a specific cancer or included non-English words. Discarded terms included drug names or treatment modalities, such as “chemotherapy” (n = 19); the names of organizations or events, such as “Race for the Cure” (n = 16); general cancer or anatomy terms, such as “oncology” (n = 11); names of celebrities, such as “Gilda Radner” (n = 5); and the carcinogen “DES” (n = 1). Also, “leucemia” (n = 1), the Spanish word for “leukemia,” was discarded because the Yahoo! Buzz Index does not consistently track foreign words, as it excludes search terms that contain non-English characters. For instance, the Yahoo! Buzz Index would not capture a search term with an accent mark, such as “cáncer colorectal” (Spanish for “colorectal cancer”).

Cancer Burden

26
]. All cancers with at least 7500 new cases in 2001, 2002, or 2003 were included in the analysis (n = 23) whether or not they were associated with Yahoo! search activity.

Cancer News Coverage
Wall Street Journal
Baltimore Sun,
 and a variety of newswire services, such as the Associated Press and UPI (United Press International). News reports published from January 1, 2001, to December 31, 2003, related to specific cancer types were found by locating reports with the identified Yahoo! search activity terms (eg, “breast cancer”) in their headlines. In the case of cancers located in the esophagus and oral cavity, for which no Yahoo! search activity terms were associated, the terms “esophageal cancer” and “oral cancer” were used as the headline search terms.

Analysis
Descriptive statistics were calculated for the Yahoo! search activity score, estimated incidence, estimated morality, and news coverage volume associated with the cancers included in the study. Spearman rank correlations were used to establish the consistency of these variables across the study period, and the data were aggregated. Next, the relationships between Yahoo! search activity and the potential correlates of interest were tested using Spearman rank correlations.
t
 tests. Finally, the Yahoo! search activity associated with several cancers was marked by sharp increases of 100% or more from one day to the next. For these cancers, we identified the three highest peaks in 2003 Yahoo! search activity and investigated corresponding news events.


Results
Table 1
). Of these, 19 cancers were associated with only one Yahoo! search term each. The 2 remaining cancers were associated with two search terms each: cancers of the brain (“brain tumor” and “brain cancer”) and multiple myeloma (“multiple myeloma” and “myeloma”). In these cases, the daily Yahoo! search activity scores associated with each term were summed into a composite score for these cancers.
The highest mean daily Yahoo! search activity scores were generated by breast cancer (mean = 14.37), lung cancer (mean = 9.08), and leukemia (mean = 7.15). Cancers with the highest US 2001–2003 incidences were breast (n = 611300), prostate (n = 608000), and lung (n = 510800). For cancer mortality, lung (n = 469500), colorectal (n = 170400), and breast (n = 120800) cancer were the leading causes of death. Breast cancer (n = 5840), leukemia (n = 2143), and prostate cancer (n = 1822) were associated with the most US news reports from 2001 to 2003. Some cancers, such as leukemia, ovarian, and testicular, appeared to be associated with more Internet search activity than their burden would dictate.

Discussion
P
 < .001). Also, Yahoo! search activity was found to rise as news coverage increased, and sharp rises in search activity from one day to the next appeared to be associated with increases in relevant news coverage. This study also suggests that the Internet can rapidly disseminate health news: the highest spike in 2003 US “prostate cancer” Yahoo! search activity seemed to be generated largely by news coverage in Australia that rapidly filtered onto the Internet via chat rooms, message boards, and medical news Web pages. Thus, it possible that a news story does not necessarily have to be covered by the US news media in order to generate US Internet search activity.

], who suggested that this discrepancy may result from more searches being required to locate online information about less common cancers. The high correlation between cancer-specific news coverage and associated online search activity in the present study suggests another explanation: some cancers received a disproportionate share of news coverage relative to their incidence and mortality, and online search activity, often prompted by news coverage, reflects this imbalance.
We detected several periodicity effects in US Yahoo! cancer search activity, which tended to be higher on weekdays and during national cancer awareness months but lower during the summer months. It should be noted that these observations are not artifacts of the size of the online population during these periods because Yahoo! search activity scores are based on the percentage, not the number, of total users. One explanation for these results is that the volume of cancer news coverage tended to follow these trends. It is also possible that users tend to search for online cancer information from school or work settings. As a result, Yahoo! cancer search activity would be expected to drop during weekends when people are at home and over the summer months when many students are out of school and many workers go on vacation.
Although Yahoo! is a leading US Internet search engine, the extent to which the findings of this study can be generalized to other search engines is not known. Also, we were unable to discern the motivations of Yahoo! users searching for cancer information. For instance, news coverage of a breast cancer drug might be associated with an increase in “breast cancer” search activity. While the Yahoo! Buzz Index would detect this rise, it cannot tell how many searchers were breast cancer patients or family members and how many were investors interested in buying stock in the company developing the drug.

]. Perhaps in the future, other Internet search engines will offer databases similar to the Yahoo! Buzz Index, and research could be conducted using a combination of search engines.


 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention funded all aspects of this study, including design; collection, management, analysis, and interpretation of the data; and preparation, review, and approval of the manuscript. Yahoo! Inc provided technical support as part of the purchase of a Yahoo! Buzz Index subscription.
