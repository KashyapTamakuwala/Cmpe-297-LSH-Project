Furthermore, they analyzed compound genotypes including three polymorphic sites. However, this small study of the promoter polymorphisms in women investigated the relation in form of compound genotypes, was not extended to haplotypes of promoter and Sp1 polymorphisms, and most importantly, did not analyze fractures, the clinically most relevant end point of osteoporosis.

]. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants, and the Medical Ethics Committee of the Erasmus Medical Center approved the study. Baseline data collection was conducted in January 1990 and June 1993, while two follow-up assessments were performed between July 1993 and January 1996 and from July 1996 until December 1999. A total of 7,983 subjects participated in the study (response rate 78%), and for the present study, we examined 6,280 individuals who were genotyped.

 = 6,280).
Nonvertebral fracture events were retrieved from computerized records of the general practitioners (GPs) in the research area. Research physicians regularly followed participant information in GP records outside the research area and made an independent review, encoding all reported events. Subsequently, a medical expert in the field reviewed all coded events for final classification. We excluded fractures that were considered nonosteoporotic, i.e., caused by cancer and high trauma, including fractures of the hand, foot, skull, and face. Subsequently, we analyzed separately “fragility” fractures, which were defined as any fracture of the hip, pelvis, or proximal humerus that had occurred with minimal trauma at older age (mean >75 years).

) was used to set up a Taqman allelic discrimination assay for the COL1PR-1997 polymorphism (primers: Fw, GCCTCCGGAGGGTGTCA, Rv, AAGGAGAGCAATTCTTACAGGTGTCT; probes: FAM-CCTGAGGGATGGAA-MGB, VIC-CCTGAAGGATGGAAG-MGB. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) mixture included 1–2 ng of genomic DNA in a 2 μL volume and the following reagents: FAM and VIC probes (200 nM), primers (0.9 μM), and 2× Taqman PCR master mix (ABgene, Epsom, UK). Reagents were dispensed in a 384-well plate using the Deerac Equator NS808 (Deerac Fluidics, Dublin, Ireland). PCR cycling was performed in 384-well PCR plates in an ABI 9700 system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and consisted of initial denaturation for 15 minutes at 95°C, 40 cycles with denaturation of 15 seconds at 95°C, and annealing and extension for 60 seconds at 60°C. Results were analyzed by the ABI Taqman 7900HT using the sequence detection system 2.22 software (Applied Biosystems). To confirm the accuracy of genotyping results, 332 (5%) randomly selected samples were regenotyped with the same method. No inconsistencies were observed. For Sp1 (intron1) an assay was set up using Primer Express Software version 2.0 (Applied Biosystems, Foster city, CA). Forward and reverse primer sequences were 5′-GTTGTCTAGGTGCTGGAGGTT-3′ and 5′-GGCGAGGGAGGAGAGAAGG-3′. The PCR mixture included 5 ng of genomic DNA in a 4 μL volume and the following reagents: FAM-CCCGCCCACATTCCCTGG-MGB probes (250 nM), TET-CCCGCCCCCATTCCCTGG-MGB probe (500 nM), primers (300 nM), 2× Taqman PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems). PCR cycling was performed in 384-well PCR plates in the ABI 9700 PCR system and consisted of initial denaturation for 15 minutes at 95°C, 40 cycles with denaturation of 15 seconds at 95°C, and annealing and extension for 60 seconds at 60°C. Results were analyzed by the ABI Taqman 7900HT using the sequence detection system 2.1 software (Applied Biosystems). To confirm the accuracy of the genotyping results, 332 randomly selected samples were genotyped for a second time with the same method. All polymorphisms had an error rate lower than 1%.

 polymorphisms using univariate analysis of variance (ANOVA). Corrections were made for age and BMI. Trend analysis assuming an underlying additive genetic model was done for the presence of zero, one, or two copies of the associated allele, incorporating the genotype variable as a continuous term in a general linear regression model. For the analysis of nonvertebral fracture follow-up data, we computed the incidence rates of fracture among genotypes and used Cox’s proportional hazards model, adjusting for age and BMI to estimate risk of fracture. For vertebral fractures, odd ratios with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated using logistic regression models since no data on the exact time of occurrence could be determined.

 values were 0.05 or lower. Finally, model assumptions were verified and model residuals checked for goodness-of-fit. SPSS 11.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL) was used for the analyses.

Since the promoter -1997G/T polymorphism is in strong LD with the Sp1 polymorphism, the observed association of haplotype 2 is driven by the SP1 polymorphism.
