, respectively. Lognormal ordinary kriging yielded a smaller average SE and effectively eliminated out-of-range predicted values compared to regular ordinary kriging. Semiautomated daily kriging estimations and semivariogram cross-validations are feasible on a national scale. Lognormal ordinary kriging with a spherical model is valid for estimating daily ambient PM at geocoded residential addresses.

), one can also manually specify the semivariogram parameters to improve the cross-validation parameters in ArcView. We selected six least satisfactory daily semivariograms throughout year 2000 and manually adjusted the semivariogram parameters to obtain the best achievable average RMSS and SPE (RMSS as close to 1 and average SPE as close to 0 as possible). The cross-validation parameters from the weighted least-squares method–calculated semivariograms were then compared to those of the manually adjusted semivariograms.

Log-normal ordinary kriging was used because it has the ability to eliminate the negative predicted values, which is a problem in ordinary kriging, especially when the source data contain extreme values.

In terms of RMSS, we considered > 95% of cross-validations as acceptable, but there were days when RMSS indicated a slight over-or underestimation of the prediction variability. These data support the overall validity of using kriging-based estimation approaches to estimate location-specific PM concentrations across the contiguous United States.

 concentrations at geocoded locations across the United States did not necessarily provide better estimation of location-specific PM (i.e., smaller SEs). To the contrary, the average SEs from the default semivariograms were smaller than those from manually adjusted semivariograms. Because each average SPE of the default-calculated daily semivariograms was close to 0, and each default-calculated daily semivariogram produced a smaller estimation error, we recommend using the default-calculated semivariogram, even though the RMSS from the default-calculated semivariogram was not fully satisfactory.

Cross-validation parameters were within the acceptable range from both regular and lognormal ordinary krigings, except for the 22 “out-of-range” days as defined above. On these out-of-range days, the SPE was well within the acceptable range for both regular and lognormal krigings, but the RMSS was > 1 from both approaches. Even so, for these out-of-range days RMSS from lognormal ordinary kriging was closer to 1 than that from regular ordinary kriging.

Here we describe our experience resolving several important methodologic and practical issues in adopting a systematic, standardized, and semiautomated kriging approach to estimate daily air pollution concentrations and the associated estimation errors at geocoded addresses across the contiguous United States over 10 years.

 raw data from 1993–2004. We then cleaned, calculated, and reconstructed site-specific daily PM concentration data ready for GIS applications. It is well known that the monitoring sites in AQS are not randomly distributed, which is one of the assumptions in kriging estimation, and the density of the monitoring sites is relatively low given the size of the contiguous United States. However, the AQS is the only currently available nationwide database. Our cross-validation studies suggest that the AQS data can be used as source data for kriging estimation of ambient pollution concentrations at various locations across the 48 contiguous states.

), but it is worth noting that in addition to using the SE as a measure of the goodness of fit of a kriging model, one could improve the health effects models by incorporating SE in the models to account for the error in the estimation of location-specific PM concentrations. We consider this an important advantage of GIS-based estimation over the traditional area-average approach and are performing studies of using SE in health effects models.

). In general, the cross-validation parameters suggest that all three models performed fairly well. Overall, the spherical model seemed to perform slightly better, consistent with the observation that the spatial distribution pattern of ambient air pollutants is closest to the assumption of the spherical model. The spherical model has been used most often in modeling spatially distributed data, providing a further rationale for its use in our large-scale population-based study of the health effects of PM. Furthermore, from the perspective of the cross-validation results, both average PE and average SPE are very close to 0, with a very narrow range of variation from the 366 daily cross-validations. These data support the overall validity of using kriging-based estimation approaches to estimate location-specific PM concentrations across the contiguous United States.

). Our results comparing lognormal ordinary kriging versus regular-scale ordinary kriging suggest that lognormal ordinary kriging not only effectively estimated location-specific PM concentrations within the range of the measured data for the days regular ordinary kriging yielded negative or “out of range” PM estimations, but also yielded a smaller average SE than did regular ordinary kriging and estimations. Therefore, our results support the use of lognormal ordinary kriging as an acceptable solution to the problem commonly posed by positively skewed distributions of environmental data.

 concentrations measured immediately across the border in Idaho, despite the real possibility that they would have the largest weights in national-scale kriging estimation. For all these reasons, we recommend national-scale kriging.
Considering the number of study participants and the length of study period (1994–2003) for the Environmental Epidemiology of Arrhythmogenesis in WHI study, development of an automated procedure enabling large-scale daily krigings and semivariogram cross-validations was critical. In this study, we decided to use ArcView for predicting individuals’ PM exposure concentrations because of the flexibility it offers for automation. Because ArcView GIS relies on either the weighted least-squares method or visual adjustment to create semivariograms, we did not compare the relative performance of semivariograms generated using alternative methods such as maximum likelihood and restricted maximum likelihood. For generating semivariograms, we compared only three popular spatial models (spherical, exponential, and Gaussian). Our results, however, do not invalidate alternative spatial models (e.g., power). In the end, we selected the spherical model for our study because it is the most studied model, and its assumption pertaining to the spatial correlation of data is probably closest to our pollutant data. Furthermore, the spherical model seemed to perform as well as or slightly better than the remaining models in terms of cross-validation parameters.
Denby et al. (2005)
 recently recommended a method that uses measured concentration data in combination with some “exploratory variables” as suggested above. However, their approach may not be feasible for a national-scale study such as ours, because little guiding information is available as to how to identify a set of widely acceptable variables that can be applied to the entire nation. Moreover, even if we could identify a set of exploratory variables, we do not know the forms or shapes of their independent and joint relations to the air pollution measures. Further studies that involve large-scale national data using universal kriging are still needed. In this study, we empirically tested whether the non-constant mean assumption for universal kriging was needed; we performed five regional ordinary krigings so that different parts of the country would assume a different mean PM concentration. Our data suggested that regional and national ordinary kriging performed similarly. Therefore, our data indirectly validated and supported the use of national ordinary kriging.
Although the primary objective of our study is to assess the short-term relationship between PM and cardiac responses, the proposed kriging method also enables us to calculate the long-term cumulative exposure of an individual by taking into account the change of his or her residences over time, because the WHI study recorded the residential location history over 10 years. Nevertheless, from the environmental perspective, an inherited limitation of the kriging-based approach is that the estimations of the PM concentrations will provide only surrogates, or the best guesses, of the true exposure levels at the locations of interest. Thus, the accuracy of the estimations depends highly on the quality of the measured data and their spatial correlation. Even if the estimations were made with a high level of confidence, they cannot be directly interpreted as the true individual-level exposures. However, to correlate individual level cardiac responses with a surrogate of location-specific exposure, our approach represents one of the best available methods for a large-scale population-based study.
In summary, our investigation of GIS approaches for estimating daily mean geocoded location-specific air pollutant concentrations and their SEs supports the use of a spherical model to perform lognormal ordinary kriging on a national scale. Our findings also support the use of default-generated semivariograms (estimated using the weighted least-squares method) without visual adjustment. We developed a semiautomated program to access and execute ArcView to implement these approaches for large-scale daily kriging estimations and semivariogram cross-validations. Detailed information about this program can be obtained on request.
