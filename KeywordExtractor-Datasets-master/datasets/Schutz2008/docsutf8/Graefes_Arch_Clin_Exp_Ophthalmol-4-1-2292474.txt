Purpose
To quantify the retinal thickness and the refractive error of the healthy human eye during hyperglycemia by means of optical coherence tomography (OCT) and Hartmann–Shack aberrometry.

Methods
Hyperglycemia was induced in five healthy subjects who were given a standard oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) after a subcutaneous injection of somatostatin. Main outcome parameters were the central, pericentral and peripheral thickness of the fovea, measured by means of optical coherence tomography (OCT3). Ocular refractive error was determined with Hartmann-Shack aberrometry. Measurements at baseline and during maximal hyperglycemia were analyzed, and a change was considered clinically significant if the difference between the measurements exceeded the threshold of 50 μm for retinal thickness and 0.2 D for refractive error.

Results
During hyperglycemia (mean blood glucose level at baseline: 4.0 mmol/l; mean maximal blood glucose level: 18.4 mmol/l) no significant changes could be found in the central, pericentral, or peripheral foveal thickness in any of the five subjects. One of the subjects had a hyperopic shift of 0.4 D, but no significant change in refractive error was found in any of the other subjects.

Conclusions
The present study shows that in healthy subjects induced hyperglycemia does not affect retinal thickness, but it can cause a small hyperopic shift of refraction.

, elevated blood pressure (>140 / 85 mmHg), a visual acuity of <0.5 (Snellen) or a history of ocular pathology. The investigators of the ocular parameters (NW and MD) were not informed about the blood glucose levels. Furthermore, the investigators who induced hyperglycemia (EE and SS) were not informed about the results of the ocular measurements. The study protocol was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the VU University Medical Center in Amsterdam, and written informed consent was obtained from all subjects after the purpose and nature of the study had been explained to them.

Procedure to induce hyperglycemia
After a 10-hour overnight fast, the subjects were given a subcutaneous injection of a low dose (100 μg) of synthetic somatostatin (Sandostatin, Novartis, Basel, Switzerland) in order to suppress endogenous insulin secretion. Each subject underwent an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) (75 g glucose) 30 minutes after the somatostatin injection, and blood glucose levels were measured with a blood glucose analyzer (HemoCue Diagnostics BV, Oisterwijk, the Netherlands). Endogenous insulin levels were measured by means of immunometric assays (Luminescence, Bayer Diagnostics, Mijdrecht, the Netherlands) in the Endocrinology Laboratory at the Department of Clinical Chemistry of the VU University Medical Center. The subjects remained in fasting state during the entire procedure.

Ocular measurements

Retinal thickness was calculated for all separate areas, and for the average pericentral and peripheral regions.

]. After pupil dilation and paralysis of accommodation with 1.0% cyclopentolate and 5.0% phenylephrine eye-drops, a series of three aberrometry measurements was made before, and every 30 minutes during the hyperglycemic condition. From these measurements, the equivalent refractive error was calculated as: equivalent refractive error (ERE) = sphere + (cylinder / 2).

Discussion
Blurred vision is a symptom that occurs frequently in patients with DM and hyperglycemia. The underlying mechanism is still unclear, and therefore the present study was carried out in an attempt to identify a possible cause of this symptom. The effect of reproducible hyperglycemia on retinal thickness and refractive error was studied in healthy young subjects who did not suffer from the systemic effects of DM.

] also found no significant difference in retinal thickness in healthy subjects during normo-insulinaemic hyperglycemia. Before and 180 minutes after the start of a hyperglycemic clamp they measured the average thickness of the retina, and found that retinal thickness was not affected by hyperglycemia. Although in the present study retinal thickness was measured under different circumstances than in the study of Jeppesen et al. (hypo-insulinaemic hyperglycemia instead of normo-insulinaemic hyperglycemia), the results confirm those of Jeppesen et al.

] measured retinal thickness by means of OCT in 136 patients with different stages of diabetic retinopathy and with a mean DM duration of 16 years. Mean foveal thickness was 307 ± 136 μm in the diabetic subjects, compared to 153 ± 15 μm in healthy subjects. It seems that only long-term hyperglycemia and/or long-term fluctuations in blood glucose levels have any significant influence on the blood–retina barrier and retinal thickness. From the findings of the present study, it appears that the blood–retina barrier does not seem to be affected by a single episode of acute hyperglycemia. Nevertheless, the fact that no change in retinal thickness could be determined does not exclude the possibility that there could be early dysfunction of the blood retina barrier. Other means of examination could evidence such a dysfunction of the blood retina barrier following acute hyperglycemia.

]. With maximally tolerated doses of somatostatin (ranging from 200 to 5000 μg/day), after a period of 15 months one out of 22 eyes required panretinal photocoagulation, compared to nine of 24 eyes that were not treated with somatostatin. From the results of the Grant et al. study, it seems that only frequent, large doses of somatostatin over a long period of time have any significant effect on the progression of diabetic retinopathy. Although the effect of somatostatin on the healthy retina has not been investigated yet, it seems to be unlikely that the results of the present study were biased by the administration of one single, low dose (100 μg) of somatostatin.
In conclusion, the results of this study indicate that in healthy subjects, hyperglycemia does not cause any change in retinal thickness. Furthermore, ocular refraction in general was not affected by hyperglycemia. However, there were interindividual variations, as illustrated by subject 01, who had a hyperopic shift of refraction during hyperglycemia. Therefore, it seems that a refractive change during hyperglycemia cannot be explained by a change in retinal thickness. It could well be that other refractive components, such as the lens, are involved in causing blurred vision and refractive alterations during hyperglycemia.
