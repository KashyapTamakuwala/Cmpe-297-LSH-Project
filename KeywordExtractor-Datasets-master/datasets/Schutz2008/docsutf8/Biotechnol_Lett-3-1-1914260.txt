 transcript levels correlated well with alternan accumulation in tuber juices. It appeared that the expression of sucrose-regulated starch-synthesizing genes (ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase subunit S and granule-bound starch synthase I) was down-regulated. Despite this, the physico-chemical properties of the transgenic starches were unaltered. These results are compared to those obtained with other transgenic potato plants producing mutan [α-(1→3)-linked glucosyl residues] and dextran [α-(1→6)-linked glucosyl residues].

Starch isolation
Potato tubers were peeled and homogenized in a Sanamat Rotor (Spangenberg, The Netherlands). The resulting homogenate was allowed to settle overnight at 4°C and the potato juice was decanted and stored at −20°C for characterization of soluble alternan. The starch pellet was washed three times with water, air-dried at room temperature for at least three days and stored at room temperature.

). We had anticipated that the nascent starch polymers would be poor acceptors for the glucansucrases. However, during starch biosynthesis potential acceptors (small maltodextrins) are thought to be generated through the action of, for instance, debranching enzymes (or isoamylases). If such a small acceptor is mutanylated, alternanylated, or dextranylated at the non-reducing end, then these novel structures might be incorporated into starch polymers through the action of certain transferases such as, for instance, branching enzyme. Apparently, this does not happen, or at a very low (undetectable) frequency, but the reason for this is unclear.

fresh wt), and that the starch granules contained approximately 5% of levan. This result contrasts with that of alternan- and dextran-accumulating plants in which foreign polymers were only found in the stroma. Taking together the results of potato transformants expressing glucan- or levansucrases in amyloplasts, it seems that the site of accumulation of the foreign polymer (granule or stroma), the solubility of the foreign polymer, and the amount of foreign polymer that is actually produced are important factors in determining starch granule morphology.
