 = .005). A link between hyperserotonemia and increased intestinal permeability remained unsupported. Increased PLT 5-HT in PDD is likely to derive from increased PLT exposure to 5-HT. Longitudinal studies, showing the (in)consistency of abnormal intestinal permeability and PLT 5-HT, may resolve present discrepancies in the literature.

Information regarding comorbidity, medication, nutritional supplements and the prevalence of GI related complaints was obtained from medical records and with the aid of assisted questionnaires. The study was performed in Curaçao (The Netherlands Antilles) in the summer of 2004. All collected urine and blood samples were transported in dry ice to the Netherlands for further analyses in the University Medical Center Groningen (UMCG). The study was approved by the Medical Ethical Committee of the St. Elisabeth Hospital in Curaçao.

Sugar Absorption Test
Intestinal permeability, reflected by the L/M ratio [median (range) 0.017 mol/mol (0.008–0.035)], indicated that none of the patients had increased intestinal permeability (i.e. L/M ratio ≥ 0.090).

In conclusion, the finding of a subgroup of children with PDD exhibiting hyperserotonemia was replicated. None of the children exhibited increased intestinal permeability, while PLT 5-HT was unrelated to both intestinal permeability and GI symptoms. Additional studies are needed to elucidate the etiology of increased PLT 5-HT in PDD and to establish its relation with intestinal pathology, if any.


We greatly acknowledge Prof. Rainer Bischoff for his valuable contribution to the study design. We also thank the children and their parents for participating in this study and also the many collaborators in the Curaçao health care without whom we would not have been able to conduct these investigations. Furthermore we thank the skilful lab workers of the University Medical Center Groningen (UMCG) for their technical assistance. The work was financially supported by the UMCG and the University of Groningen, The Netherlands. An abstract of this work has been published in the Netherlands Journal for Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine.
