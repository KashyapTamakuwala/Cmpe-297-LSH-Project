Aims/hypothesis
Type 1 diabetes results from the autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta cells. Exogenous insulin therapy cannot achieve precise physiological control of blood glucose concentrations, and debilitating complications develop. Lentiviral vectors are promising tools for liver-directed gene therapy. However, to date, transduction rates in vivo remain low in hepatocytes, without the induction of cell cycling. We investigated long-term transgene expression in quiescent hepatocytes in vitro and determined whether the lentiviral delivery of furin-cleavable insulin to the liver could reverse diabetes in rats.

Materials and methods
To improve transduction efficiency in vitro, we optimised hepatocyte isolation and maintenance protocols and, using an improved surgical delivery method, delivered furin-cleavable insulin alone or empty vector to the livers of streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats by means of a lentiviral vector. Rats were monitored for changes in body weight and blood glucose, and intravenous glucose tolerance tests were performed. Expression of insulin was determined by RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy.

Results
We achieved long-term transgene expression in quiescent hepatocytes in vitro (87 ± 1.2% transduction efficiency), with up to 60 ± 3.2% transduction in vivo. We normalised blood glucose for 500 days—a significantly longer period than previously reported—making this the first successful study using a lentiviral vector. This procedure resulted in the expression of genes encoding several beta cell transcription factors, some pancreatic endocrine transdifferentiation, hepatic insulin storage in granules, and restoration of glucose tolerance. Liver function tests remained normal. Importantly, pancreatic exocrine transdifferentiation did not occur.

Conclusions/interpretation
Our data suggest that this regimen may ultimately be employed for the treatment of type 1 diabetes.

 TDU) was infused through the PV. During this procedure, blood supply to the liver was stopped for 5 min and then recommenced for 2 min. This procedure of intervallic infusion in full flow occlusion (FFO) was repeated three times. Animals in Group 2 were treated similarly; except 0.9% saline was infused. A 70% partial hepatectomy was performed on animals in Group 3 by resecting the left lateral and median liver lobes. The right adrenal vein was ligated and LV was infused 24 h later by the procedure detailed for Group 1. A fourth group of animals was treated the same as Group 3, except 0.9% saline was infused. Livers were removed at 1, 2, 4 and 8 weeks. Transduction efficiency was assessed by flow cytometric quantification of EGFP-positive cells.To assess cell proliferation, 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (100 mg/kg; Sigma) was injected intraperitoneally at 18, 28 and 48 h after surgery (partial hepatectomy or sham-operated) and into untreated animals (three animals per time-point). After 2 h, livers were excised and processed by conventional histological techniques. Incorporation of 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine was determined by immunohistochemistry.Diabetes was induced by an intraperitoneal injection of STZ (75 mg/kg body weight; Sapphire Science, Crows Nest, NSW, Australia). Animals received HMD/INS-FUR or empty HMD vector administered by FFO without partial hepatectomy. After treatment, animals were monitored for body weight and blood glucose. Animals were killed at 60 or 500 days and body tissues were sampled. To determine the proportion of EGFP-expressing cells that were hepatocytes, liver cells were isolated and stained with anti-cytokeratin 18 (CK18) antibody (Chemicon, Temecula, CA, USA) and R-phycoerythrin-conjugated secondary antibody (Chemicon). Numbers of insulin-positive cells were determined using an anti-insulin antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) and aminomethylcoumarin-conjugated secondary antibody followed by flow cytometric analysis.

Discussion
This is the first report of permanent amelioration of STZ-induced hyperglycaemia using LV delivery of INS-FUR. Transduced animals processed, stored and secreted insulin in a glucose-regulated manner. Remission of diabetes, due to the secretion of insulin from residual beta cells, was discounted as insulin-positive pancreatic beta cells were rarely observed and levels of rat C-peptide were negligible. This is also the first report showing that transduction of INS-FUR alone can induce expression of several beta cell transcription factors resulting in hepatocyte differentiation along a pancreatic lineage.
