 by homologous recombination. The mutant had no growth defect in media containing different nitrogen sources. Total GS activity in culture filtrates was markedly reduced in the mutant, although activity in cell-free extracts remained normal. Virulence was unaffected in both in vitro and in vivo model systems of infection, indicating that the presence of extra-cellular GS is not critical for virulence and that the residual intra-cellular GS activity is sufficient. Thus although GlnD does play a role in the control of ammonia assimilation, it is not required for virulence.

 There was no significant difference in the total GS activity between the mutant and wild-type in the cell-free extracts. However, in culture filtrates the situation was very different. We found a large reduction in total GS activity in the mutant strain grown in all media except low ammonia (where the level of activity was at its lowest). This was particularly pronounced in ammonia-rich conditions, where the wild-type activity was at its highest.
