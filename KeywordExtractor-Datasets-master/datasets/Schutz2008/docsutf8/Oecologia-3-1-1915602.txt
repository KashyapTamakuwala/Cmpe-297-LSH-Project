 larvae. However, higher levels of indole glucosinolates were measured in roots of plants exposed to foliar herbivory, suggesting that the development of the root herbivore and its parasitoid may be, at least partly, negatively affected by increased levels of these allelochemicals in root tissues. Our results show that foliar herbivores can affect the development not only of root-feeding insects but also their natural enemies. We argue that such indirect interactions between above- and below-ground biota may play an important role in the structuring and functioning of communities.

To standardize the possible effects of the clip cages on plant shoots, they were also placed on control plants, following the same methods as for the foliar-damaged plants. A total of 72 plants were used in the experiment (36 plants with and 36 without foliar herbivore damage).

 were tested using a generalized linear model (with normal distribution and identity link function). The effects of foliar herbivory and root type (primary or secondary roots) on plant quality (nitrogen and glucosinolate levels) were tested using a linear mixed model, including plant as random term to consider that the fine and main roots were sampled from the same plants. To test the effect of foliar herbivory on plant quantity (root biomass), we used analysis of variance. Normality, independence, and homogeneity of variance were checked by inspection of the residuals after model fitting. Analyses were carried out in Statistica and Genstat.

Further studies, combining interactions between above-ground and below-ground communities in a multitrophic framework, and which seek to explore both processes and mechanisms, are required if we are to develop a better understanding of the many complex factors that influence community structure and function.


The authors wish to thank Antonin Ferry at Rennes University for sharing his expertise on the parasitoid-rearing and for constructive comments during the experiment; Leo Koopman at Wageningen University for supplying the foliar-herbivore cultures; Gregor Disveld for assistance in maintenance of plants; Ciska Raaijmakers for assistance in the glucosinolate extractions; and Eef Velthorst at Wageningen University for the N-contents determination. The experiments were carried out in the Netherlands and complied with the current laws of the country. NIOO-KNAW publication 3869.
