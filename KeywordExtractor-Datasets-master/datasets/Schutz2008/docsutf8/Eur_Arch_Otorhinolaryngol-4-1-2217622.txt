Introduction

]. When the cochlea is stimulated by two tones, distortion products (DPs) can be measured in cochlear microphonic potentials (CMDP) and in the external auditory meatus as otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE). Both microphonic and acoustic DPs are considered to be reflections of OHC electromotility in the cochlea. Obviously, it is of interest to find a relation between these two functional modalities of the cochlea and the OHC in particular.

]. Another clinical example of increased inner ear pressure or volume with an accompanying change of cochlear function is the endolymphatic hydrops in patients with Ménière’s disease.

 CMDP. We attempt to establish a better understanding of increased inner ear pressure effects on DPs in both CM potentials and OAE’s.

Materials and methods
Experiments were performed in eight guinea pigs (Harlan Laboratories, The Netherlands; body weight 350–450 g) with a positive Preyer reflex. Animal care and use were in accordance with the principles of the declaration of Helsinki and approved by the animal experiment committee (protocol number 3047/3103).

] was injected with a constant flow rate by applying a controllable pneumatic pressure to the barrel end. The injected volume was measured as the displacement of the fluid meniscus in the pipette, for which the inner diameter is precisely known (0.84 mm). The fluid injection rate was calculated as the total injected volume divided by the total injection time.

]. In normal ears, hydrostatic pressure in the perilymph equals pressure in the endolymph, and pressure changes applied to one compartment are immediately transmitted to the other through the elastic walls. The perilymph is in a dynamic equilibrium with the cerebrospinal fluid via the cochlear aqueduct. An excess of perilymph will escape through the cochlear aqueduct restoring inner ear fluid level.

], but this effect is then more than compensated for by an improved middle ear transfer.
Anyhow, the observed changes are small. Changes of overall inner ear fluid pressure have minor effects on cochlear function. It may be that creating an artificial endolymphatic hydrops, by injecting artificial endolymph into scala media instead of scala tympani, has a larger effect. This is currently tested in further research, which will hopefully give insight into diseases with pathologically changed inner ear fluid volumes, as in Ménière’s disease.
