Aims/hypothesis
To assess whether self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) is an independent predictor of improved outcome in a community-based cohort of type 2 diabetic patients.

Materials and methods
We used longitudinal data from (1) 1,280 type 2 diabetic participants in the observational Fremantle Diabetes Study (FDS) who reported SMBG and diabetes treatment status at study entry (1993–1996), and (2) a subset of 531 participants who attended six or more annual assessments (referred to as the 5-year cohort). Diabetes-related morbidity, cardiac death and all-cause mortality were ascertained at each assessment, supplemented by linkage to the Western Australian Data Linkage System.

Results
p
 = 0.005). In Cox proportional hazards modelling, after adjustment for confounding and explanatory variables, SMBG was not independently associated with all-cause mortality, but was associated with a 79% increased risk of cardiovascular mortality in patients not treated with insulin. For the 5-year cohort, time-dependent SMBG was independently associated with a 48% reduced risk of retinopathy.

Conclusions/interpretation
SMBG was not independently associated with improved survival. Inconsistent findings relating to the association of SMBG with cardiac death and retinopathy may be due to confounding, incomplete covariate adjustment or chance.

Time-dependent Cox models were included to allow for commencement (or discontinuation) of SMBG during follow-up. In both unadjusted and adjusted models, SMBG during follow-up was associated with a reduction in the risk of retinopathy of approximately 50%. In unadjusted analysis, the risk of the development of any macrovascular disease was reduced by 33% in patients who used SMBG, but this became non-significant after full adjustment.SMBG was not associated with the first occurrence of the composite ROSSO endpoint (which occurred infrequently), either at baseline or as a time-dependent covariate.

]) were both much greater in the FDS. The present analyses are therefore likely to have assessed the independent contribution of SMBG to diabetes-associated morbidity and mortality with greater validity. A healthy survivor effect may also have confounded the relationship between SMBG and non-fatal outcome in ROSSO, while these analyses were undertaken in FDS participants alive at the end of 5 years of follow-up.

].
The results of the present study do not support a relationship between SMBG and improved survival in a well-characterised community-based sample of type 2 diabetic patients. We found evidence that SMBG was associated with an increased risk of cardiac death and a reduced risk of retinopathy. These conflicting results might reflect complex interactions between patient, physician and disease factors in particular circumstances, but may also represent the effects of confounding, incomplete covariate adjustment or chance.
