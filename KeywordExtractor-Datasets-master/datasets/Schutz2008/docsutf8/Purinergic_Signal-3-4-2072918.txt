onformation (ADAPINCs). Such antibodies are especially useful for immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation analyses, whereas antibodies against synthetic peptides usually function well only in Western-blot analyses. Here we illustrate the utility of the new antibodies to monitor the cell surface expression of and to purify some key players of purinergic signalling.

]. ENTPD5 and ENTPD6 lack the second transmembrane region. Moreover, in ENTPD5, the region corresponding to the first transmembrane domain of the other family members is N-terminal and functions as a signal peptide, resulting in the secretion of ENTPD5 into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. ENTPD6 is a type II transmembrane protein. ENTPD orthologues show high (ca. 80–90%) sequence identity; the paralogues within a given species show lower (30–50%) identity.

Then, 20 h after transfection, cells were fixed for 10 min in 2% paraformaldehyde (PFA) and then stained with serial dilutions of immune serum for 30 min at room temperature. To detect ENTPD5, which is not bound to the cell surface, cells were fixed in 4% PFA and subsequently permeabilized with 0.5% IGEPAL (Sigma) before staining. Bound antibody was detected with PE-conjugated antirat or antirabbit IgG (1:100) (Dianova). Cell nuclei were counterstained with Hoechst 33342. Cells were analyzed with a Zeiss Axiovert 25 microscope equipped with the Canon PowerShot G2 digital camera and appropriate filters for visualizing Hoechst stain (Zeiss filter set 01), green fluorescent protein (Zeiss filter set 10) and PE fluorochrome (Zeiss filter set 15). Photographs were taken at 40× magnification with fixed camera settings (digital zoom: 4.3×, aperture: 5.0, exposure time: 2 s for GFP and PE, 1/8 s for Hoechst 33342). GFP and PE images were merged using Adobe Photoshop software.

Beads were washed four times in PBS/1% Triton X-100. Proteins were eluted from the beads by incubation in SDS-PAGE sample buffer for 15 min at 70°C. Eluted proteins were size-fractionated on precast SDS-PAGE gels (Invitrogen) and blotted onto PVDF membranes. Purinoceptors and ecto-enzymes were detected with serially diluted serum followed by peroxidase (PO)-conjugated antirabbit IgG (1:5,000) using the ECL system (Amersham).

]. These antibodies are valuable tools for assessing the expression levels of the native protein by immunofluorescence analyses and flow cytometry, i.e., assays in which antipeptide antibodies often fail. The antibodies described here provide useful tools for further characterization of the structure and function of these purinoceptors and ecto-enzymes.
