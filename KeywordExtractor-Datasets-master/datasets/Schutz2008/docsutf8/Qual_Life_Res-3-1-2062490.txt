Aim
Whether a prostate cancer diagnosis induces response shift has not been established so far. Therefore, we assessed response shift in men who were diagnosed with localized prostate cancer.

Patients and methods
Out of 3,892 men who completed a questionnaire before screening, 82 were subsequently diagnosed with prostate cancer. Response shift was assessed in 52 (response 63%) by the then-test (EuroQol self-rating of health, Short-Form 36 mental health and vitality) and a novel method: rating of vignettes relating to side effects of prostate cancer treatment (urinary, bowel and erectile dysfunction). Three then-tests were conducted: two referencing pre-diagnosis (measured pre- and post-treatment), and one referencing pre-treatment (measured post-treatment).

Results
P 
< 0.001, moderate effect size).

Conclusions
We found evidence for response shift in men who were diagnosed with prostate cancer. Men evaluated urinary, bowel, and erectile dysfunction as less bad after they had become patients who can expect to experience these side effects. The rating of vignettes is a promising additional technique to assess response shift.

]. These three forms of response shift are illustrated in the following example. Imagine a woman X. When asked to rate her QoL she thought of her (50-h a week) job, her partner and playing volleyball with friends, and rated her QoL as very good. Unfortunately she fell ill. For some months she was not able to work. Her partner and relatives supported her a great deal, which she appreciated enormously. Gradually she recovered and started working again for 20 h a week, but was no longer able to play volleyball. She rated her new QoL again as very good, but this time the main aspects of her QoL consisted of her partner, her family and work. Her ratings did not change, i.e. twice ‘very good’, but in fact three forms of response shift had occurred. ‘Work’ changed from a 50-h a week job to 20 h a week (recalibration), her partner became more important (reprioritization), and her concept of QoL has changed: no more sports, but relatives instead (reconceptualization).

] enabled us to include a cohort of men shortly before they were screened and subsequently diagnosed. We aimed at assessing the magnitude and direction of response shift effects after diagnosis and again after primary treatment. We employed two methods: the common then-test and a novel approach including rating of vignettes related to side effects of prostate cancer treatment (urinary, bowel, and erectile dysfunction).

As a novel method to assess response shift we used vignettes that each described a health state relating to side effects of therapy for localized prostate cancer, i.e. urinary, bowel or erectile dysfunction. The vignettes contained items of the EQ-5D self-classifier complemented with items on dysfunction, for instance, ‘Mr. A has no problems in walking about, has no problems washing or dressing himself, experiences urinary leakage daily, has no pain or discomfort, is not anxious or depressed’. Respondents were asked to indicate how good or bad they evaluated these health states on visual analog scales anchored at the lower end (0) by ‘very bad’ and at the upper end (10) by ‘very good’. We used the vignettes to explore reprioritization. We hypothesized that men would value the health states as less detrimental after diagnosis than before. After diagnosis they knew they might experience these dysfunctions themselves in the context of prostate cancer treatment.

. If we measure only EQ-VAS preceding diagnosis and at 1-month post-diagnosis, the difference between these scores is regarded the ‘observed change’. However, if the retrospective pre-diagnosis assessment provides a more valid comparison with the post-diagnosis assessment, the ‘true change’ is reflected by the difference between the retrospective pre-diagnosis assessment and the post-diagnosis assessment. The difference between the pre-diagnosis assessment and the retrospective pre-diagnosis assessment provides an indication of the size and direction of the ‘response shift’ induced by the diagnosis. Similar explanations are valid for the other data points in the figure

The results of the then-test were significant in 4 out of 9 comparisons, the results of the vignettes in 5 out of 6. The overall type I error rate, which is the ratio of significant findings to the number of comparisons, was 0.6 (9 out of 15).

Discussion
Men diagnosed with prostate cancer evaluated their pre-diagnosis health in retrospect as better than at the reference point itself. Post-diagnosis–pre-treatment health was rated worse in retrospect than at the reference point. This suggests that ‘true’ changes in health between the first assessment before diagnosis and the second one at 1 month post-diagnosis were larger than the original scores disclosed, and that  response shifts were induced by first, the diagnosis, and second, subsequent treatment. The sizes of the response shifts induced by the diagnosis were larger than those induced by the treatment. The negligible to small effect sizes indicated that only some recalibration occurred. The directions of the effect sizes were interpretable and consistent with our hypotheses.
Additionally, men evaluated vignettes relating to side effects of prostate cancer treatment as less detrimental after they were diagnosed than before diagnosis. We interpreted this change as a reprioritization of respondents who became aware after being diagnosed with prostate cancer that they were at risk of experiencing these health states themselves as a consequence of being treated for prostate cancer. In this new context dysfunctional health states were evaluated as less bad than before. The effect sizes were moderate for erectile dysfunction and small in the two other ones, indicating that reprioritization also occurred. The directions of the effect sizes were interpretable and consistent with our hypotheses.
The overall type I error rate was 0.6, which indicated that the statistical significance is very unlikely to be caused by chance. This is an additional indication that our findings reflect real differences. We conclude that the results of the then-tests and the ratings of the vignettes both indicate the presence of a response shift and adaptation of the patients to their new situation.

The present study has several strengths and limitations. The study design is one of its strengths; the unique context of the ERSPC enabled the inclusion of respondents before they (or anyone else) were aware that they had prostate cancer, which is usually unfeasible. To our knowledge this is the first study to measure response shift in men who were diagnosed with cancer. An additional strength is the compliance of the respondents; 51 of the 52 respondents completed the 7-month assessment.
For the then-test we selected measures that are considered subjective (i.e. SF-36 mental health and vitality, and EQ-5D of own health) but no objective items, which can be considered a drawback of the study. Furthermore, we acknowledge that offering questionnaires in two different modes (self-administered questionnaires before diagnosis vs. telephone interviews afterwards) may have been less than optimal. This design was chosen based on practical considerations, because assessments by telephone in 3,892 screen participants was not feasible, and self-administered questionnaires at 1 month after diagnosis undesirable since we wanted these assessments to be completed before the initiation of treatment. The unavailability of information on marital status and education is also a drawback. Another potential limitation of our study is that the interval between the initiation of treatment and the assessment at 7-months post-diagnosis was not the same for all respondents; it is possible that response shift may vary according to the length of time that elapsed since treatment. However, information on this interval had been of limited use. The most common therapies for localized prostate cancer nowadays are surgery, radiotherapy, and active surveillance. These therapies differ greatly (by nature) in duration, the onset of side effects and their course over time.
It may be that particular groups may be more prone to response shift than others, e.g. depending on age or prognosis. We plan to address this issue further, preferably in a larger sample than used in the current study.

Conclusions
Using two complementary techniques we found that a diagnosis of prostate cancer induces response shift. From a methodology point of view, the vignette-method needs to be explored further.
