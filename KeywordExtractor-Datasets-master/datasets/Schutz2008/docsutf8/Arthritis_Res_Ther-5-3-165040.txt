The intervertebral disc is a cartilaginous structure that resembles articular cartilage in its biochemistry, but morphologically it is clearly different. It shows degenerative and ageing changes earlier than does any other connective tissue in the body. It is believed to be important clinically because there is an association of disc degeneration with back pain. Current treatments are predominantly conservative or, less commonly, surgical; in many cases there is no clear diagnosis and therapy is considered inadequate. New developments, such as genetic and biological approaches, may allow better diagnosis and treatments in the future.

It alters disc height and the mechanics of the rest of the spinal column, possibly adversely affecting the behaviour of other spinal structures such as muscles and ligaments. In the long term it can lead to spinal stenosis, a major cause of pain and disability in the elderly; its incidence is rising exponentially with current demographic changes and an increased aged population.

In this short review we outline the morphology and biochemistry of normal discs and the changes that arise during degeneration. We review recent advances in our understanding of the aetiology of this disorder and discuss new approaches to treatment.

Disc morphology
The normal disc

], who demonstrated an age-associated change in morphology, with discs from individuals as young as 2 years of age having some very mild cleft formation and granular changes to the nucleus. With increasing age comes an increased incidence of degenerative changes, including cell death, cell proliferation, mucous degeneration, granular change and concentric tears. It is difficult to differentiate changes that occur solely due to ageing from those that might be considered 'pathological'.

The integrity of the matrix is also important for maintaining the relatively avascular and aneural nature of the healthy disc.

]; this may be due to extensive cross-linking, which appears to occur more within the disc matrix than in other connective tissues.

Changes in disc biochemistry with degeneration

]. The aggrecan molecules become degraded, with smaller fragments being able to leach from the tissue more readily than larger portions. This results in loss of glycosaminoglycans; this loss is responsible for a fall in the osmotic pressure of the disc matrix and so a loss of hydration.

Nutritional pathways to disc degeneration

New therapies

Because disc degeneration is thought to lead to degeneration of adjacent tissues and be a risk factor in the development of spinal stenosis in the long term, new treatments are in development that are aimed at restoring disc height and biomechanical function. Some of the proposed biological therapies are outlined below.

At present, although experimental work demonstrates the potential of these cell-based therapies, several barriers prevent the use of these treatments clinically. Moreover, these treatments are unlikely to be appropriate for all patients; some method of selecting appropriate patients will be required if success with these therapies is to be realized.

). Moreover, the research effort in, for instance, the kidney in comparison with that in the disc is completely disparate to the relative costs of the disorders associated with each organ and the number of people affected. Unless more research attention is attracted to interverterbal disc biology, little will come from these new technologies, and back pain will remain as it is at present – a poorly diagnosed and poorly treated syndrome that reduces the quality of life of a significant proportion of the population.

Figures and Tables
Figure 1
A schematic view of a spinal segment and the intervertebral disc. The figure shows the organization of the disc with the nucleus pulposus (NP) surrounded by the lamellae of the annulus fibrosus (AF) and separated from the vertebral bodies (VB) by the cartilaginous end-plate (CEP). The figure also shows the relationship between the intervertebral disc and the spinal cord (SC), the nerve root (NR), and the apophyseal joints (AJ).



Figure 2
The normal and degenerate lumbar intervertebral disc. The figure shows a normal intervertebral disc on the left. The annulus lamellae surrounding the softer nucleus pulposus are clearly visible. In the highly degenerate disc on the right, the nucleus is desiccated and the annulus is disorganized.
