Background and aims
Little is known about the intestinal epithelial expression and secretion of CXCL10 (IP-10), a chemokine involved in recruiting T cells and monocytes. We aimed to study CXCL10 gene expression and regulation by the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1β, interferon (IFN)-γ and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α in intestinal epithelial cell lines.

Materials and methods
CXCL10 expression and secretion kinetics were assessed in Caco-2, HT-29 and DLD1 human colon epithelial cells, treated with IL-1β, TNF-α, IFN-γ alone or in combination with each other by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), Northern blotting and enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA). Transient transfections with TGL-IP10 (CXCL10 promoter) and TGL-IP10-κB2 mutant promoter and gelshifts and supershifts for nuclear factor (NF)-κB were also performed.

Results
Real-time PCRs and ELISA experiments revealed that IL-1β was the strongest and earliest inducer of CXCL10 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression and protein secretion in Caco-2 cell line, whereas INF-γ had a delayed kinetics. There was a strong synergistic effect of either TNF-α or IL-1β with IFN-γ both on CXCL10 mRNA expression and protein secretion in all three cell lines. Real-time PCR and ELISA experiments using a specific NF-κB inhibitor and transfection experiments with a NF-κB-binding defective CXCL10 promoter construct revealed that the induction of CXCL10 by IL-1β and its synergism with IFN-γ is NF-κB dependent.

Conclusion
These data demonstrate that in colonic epithelial cells, depending on the cellular context and utilizing the NF-κB pathway, IL-1β alone and/or in synergism with IFN-γ may play a major role in the induction of CXCL10.

], in inducing CXCL10 expression by IECs and its possible signalling mechanisms was given importance. To consider possible influences of cellular differentiation on cytokine responsiveness, we performed studies on three different colonic epithelial cell lines. Our findings will get an insight into the role of intestinal epithelium in immune responses and in evaluating pathways, which might be targets of present and future pharmacotherapy of IBD and possibly colorectal cancer.

Materials and methods
Biological reagents
The recombinant cytokines IL-1β, TNF-α and IFN-γ were purchased from Roche applied science (Mannheim, Germany). An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit for CXCL10 was purchased from RnD systems (Weisbaden, Germany). The nuclear factor (NF)-κB inhibitor BAY11-7082 was purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA).

 cells per well for real-time polymerase chain reactions (PCRs), ELISA, Northern blotting and electrophoresis mobility shift assay (EMSA) experiments unless until stated and grown till they reached 70–80% confluence. These cells were then stimulated with IL-1β (0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, 10 and 50 ng/ml), TNF-α (2, 10 and 50 ng/ml) and IFN-γ (2, 10 and 50 ng/ml) based on the type of experiments.

RNA isolation, real-time PCR
Ribonucleic acid (RNA) was isolated by using Qiagen RNeasy mini kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The RNA concentrations were determined photometrically using a Gene Quant RNA/deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) calculator (Pharmacia, Freiburg, Germany). RNA was subsequently used for real-time PCR and Northern blot analysis. Reverse transcription of messenger RNA (mRNA) was performed using 1 μg of total cellular RNA. To determine the mRNA expression of CXCL10, real-time PCR was carried out using gene-specific primers for human CXCL10 (Invitrogen GmbH, Karlsruhe) forward 5′-CCA GAA TCG AAG GCC ATC AA-3′, reverse 5′-CAT TTC CTT GCT AAC TGC TTT CAG-3′ and β-actin (Invitrogen GmbH) forward 5′-CTG GCA CCC AGC ACA ATG-3′, reverse 5′-CCG ATC CAC ACG GAG TAC TTG-3′ in an ABI Prism 7000 sequence detection system. PCR reaction was set up with Sybr® Green PCR Master mix (Invitrogen) containing 0.3 μmol/l primers each and 1 μl of RT-product in 25 μl volume. A two-step amplification protocol was chosen consisting of initial denaturation at 95°C for 10 min followed by 45 cycles with 15 s denaturation at 95°C and 30 s annealing/extension at 60°C. Finally, a dissociation protocol was performed to control specificity of amplification products.

Luciferase assays
Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were stimulated with IL-1β (0.1,1, 2, 10 and 50 ng/ml), TNF-α (2, 10 and 50 ng/ml), IFN-γ (2, 10 and 50 ng/ml), IL-1β (1 ng/ml) + TNFα (50 ng/ml), IL-1β (1 ng/ml) + IFN-γ (50 ng/ml) and TNFα (50 ng/ml) + IFN-γ (50 ng/ml) for 24 h, harvested and lysed, and luciferase was assayed by using a luciferase kit (Promega). Values were normalised to renilla luciferase.

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
To study the synergistic effects of cytokines on CXCL10 secretion, supernatants were collected at 0, 3, 6, 12 and 24 h in Caco-2 and HT29 cells stimulated with IL-1β (1 ng/ml), TNF-α (50 ng/ml), IFN-γ (50 ng/ml), IL-1β (0.5 ng/ml) + TNFα (50 ng/ml), IL-1β (0.5 ng/ml) + IFN-γ (50 ng/ml) and TNFα (50 ng/ml) + IFN-γ (50 ng/ml) and stored at −70°C until measured. CXCL10 protein secretion was measured by ELISA according to the manufacturer’s protocol.

Centrifuged briefly, excess PBS was removed, and the pellet was resuspended in ice-cold extraction buffer (20 mM hydroxyethyl piperazineethanesulfonic acid [HEPES] pH 7.8, 10 mM KCL, 0.1 mM ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid [EDTA], 1 mM dithiothreitol and 0.5 mM phenylmethanesulphonylfluoride [PMSF]) by gentle pippeting. Cells were then kept on ice for 15 min, and 30 μl of 10% Nonidet NP-40 was added and vortexed briefly for 10 s. The lysed cell suspension was centrifuged for 30 s, and the supernatant was discarded. The pellet was resuspended in 50 μl extraction buffer containing 400 mM NaCl, agitated vigorously for 15 min at 4°C. Then, the cell suspension was centrifuged for 5 min at 4°C, and the supernatant containing the nuclear extract was collected and stored at −80°C until further use.

Evaluating the role of NF-κB in CXCL10 gene expression
To evaluate the possible role of NF-κB in cytokine-induced CXCL10 gene expression, experiments with a specific NF-κB inhibitor were performed. The effect of BAY 11-7082 on NF-κB inhibition was evaluated by reporter assays. BAY11-7082 was able to dose-dependently inhibit IL-1β-induced pNF-κB-SEAP gene reporter activity in Caco-2 cells (data not shown). Based on this experiment, we could determine that 10 μM of BAY11-7082 was sufficient to inhibit the NF-κB activation.

Super shifts were performed with anti-p65 antibody. Similar results were obtained in two separate experiments






Discussion
In addition to its many homeostatic functions such as barrier protection, mucus production and resorption, the intestinal epithelium plays an important role in regulating local inflammation and immune responses. The intestinal epithelium participates in inflammatory responses in part through the generation of numerous cytokines and chemokines that mediate recruitment and activation of inflammatory cells. The epithelium is involved in local cytokine networks allowing first response to noxious agents as well as cross-talk with immune cells to help provide an effective inflammatory response. These bi-directional inflammatory communications are necessary for normal host defence, but they also play an important role in the pathogenesis of IBD and might be also of importance in modulating anti-tumoural immunity in colonic malignancies. In this report, we demonstrate that pro-inflammatory cytokines, which may be produced by sub-mucosal immune cells, can differentially and co-ordinately regulate CXCL10 gene expression in IECs.

Especially, the role of IL-1β alone and its synergism with both TNF-α and IFN-γ on CXCL10 gene expression in IECs has been given no attention.

]. We here report for the first time that in intestinal epithelial cell lines, IL-1β alone or in combination with IFN-γ induced CXCL10 gene expression. In Caco-2 cells, the combination led to an early synergistic induction of both CXCL10 mRNA and protein compared to the combination of IFN-γ+TNF-α. This early induction of CXCL10 mRNA and protein by IL-1β+IFN-γ in Caco-2 might be due to the early convergence of signalling pathways that activates transcription factors like NF-κB, IRF-1, STAT1 or other factors that mediate transcription factor interactions.

] clearly showed that in Caco-2 cells, none of the cytokines and their combinations were able to induce the CXCL10 promoter activity. In HT29 cells, the combination of IFN-γ + TNF-α led to a weaker induction of TGL-IP10κB-2 mutant activity, whereas in DLD1cells, the combination of IL-1β + IFN-γ and IFN-γ + TNF-α led to a weak induction of TGL-IP10 κB-2 mutant activity. Based on these data, we can conclude that NF-κB plays a critical role in CXCL10 gene expression induced by cytokines in IECs, and this is mainly dependent on the κB-2 site present in its promoter. Moreover, IFN-γ-induced CXCL10 mRNA and protein secretion was inhibited upon NF-kB inhibition.

] showed that co-operation between IFN-γ induced STAT1, and the constitutively active or inducible NF-κB is necessary for the transcriptional activity of IFN-γ-inducible genes like MIG and CXCL10. Therefore, we suggest a similar mechanism for IFN-γ-induced CXCL10 in IECs.
46
] recently showed that in contrast to HT29 where IFNγ up-regulated CXCL8 secretion, the same was unaffected in Caco-2 cells or even down-regulated in primary colonic epithelial cells. Future studies on chemokine regulation should therefore include primary cells, keeping well in mind that the presence of contaminating immune cells, culture conditions and cell stress during isolation may influence results.
Taken together, our data suggest that while IFN-γ, TNF-α and IL-1β may work individually through disparate signalling pathways in CXCL10 gene regulation, a combination of these cytokines enhances transcription of the CXCL10 gene in an NF-κB-dependent manner. The fact that IL-1β via activation of NF-κB is able to mimic the effect of TNF-α in augmenting CXCL10 expression might be of importance in patients with IBD, who do not respond to anti TNF-α antibody therapy. In those cases, an additional inhibition of IL-1β might be desirable as a future therapy option in treating IBD.
