Abstract
d
-galactose, using NMR relaxation and molecular dynamics simulation. These two approaches present an entirely consistent view of the dynamic changes that occur in the protein backbone upon ligand binding. Increases in the amplitude of motions are observed throughout the protein, with the exception of a few residues in the binding site, which show restriction of dynamics. These counter-intuitive results imply that a localised binding event causes a global increase in the extent of protein dynamics on the pico- to nanosecond timescale. This global dynamic change constitutes a substantial favourable entropic contribution to the free energy of ligand binding. These results suggest that the structure and dynamics of ABP may be adapted to exploit dynamic changes to reduce the entropic costs of binding.

Introduction
An important goal of structural biology is to predict and manipulate the interactions between proteins and small-molecule ligands. To this end, extensive research efforts have been aimed at relating the known structure of protein–ligand complexes to the thermodynamics of that interaction. The success of these attempts has been limited, in part because of their neglect of the role of protein and ligand conformational dynamics in determining ligand-binding thermodynamics.
1,2

 One can contrast this former view of protein–ligand interactions with one that considers the restriction in conformational degrees of freedom, which must necessarily be entailed by binding. From this perspective, an unfavourable change in entropy is expected to characterise these interactions. This requires a larger, favourable enthalpic contribution, which may arise directly from the protein–ligand interaction or from solvation effects.

 yet there is no clear understanding of the basis of either the large favourable binding enthalpy or the unfavourable entropy change on binding.

 Even if the cost of confinement of the water molecules in the binding site of ABP is much less than this maximal value, it is clear that the overall cost of constraining these water molecules in the binding site will be substantial.

 We investigate this latter possibility by examining the contribution of protein dynamics to the entropy of interaction of ABP with its ligands.

Small chemical shift differences are seen at sites distal to the binding site and hinge region. These differences suggest that subtle changes in conformation or dynamics throughout the molecule occur on binding.

Figure 2
) showed apoABP to be “opened” by a domain hinge motion of ∼ 20° with respect to the crystal structure of the ABP–galactose complex. This represents a conformational change similar to those seen in other members of the periplasmic-binding protein family. In addition, small changes to individual domain structures are required for optimal agreement with RDCs. This supports the inference from chemical shift changes, that ligand binding has subtle conformational consequences throughout the protein.

Dynamics of ABP

Figure 3
(a) and (b)). In both apoABP and the complex we see almost exclusively the large order parameters typical of the relatively rigid backbone of globular proteins. Remarkably, order parameters for apoABP are generally larger than for the ABP–galactose complex, indicating that pico- to nanosecond motions are more extensive in the complex than in the apo protein.
Figure 3
(c)).
To confirm and further explore the basis of this result, we have performed molecular dynamics simulations for ABP in the apo state and in complex with galactose. By several measures, we see significant increases in backbone dynamics in the complex as compared with the apo protein. RMS deviations from the average structure for both the N and C domains are significantly larger for the ABP–galactose complex than for apoABP. In addition, fluctuations of backbone heavy-atom positions across the trajectory are generally larger in the complex than in the apo protein (data not shown). Furthermore, these dynamic changes are seen to be more pronounced in the N domain than the C domain, consistent with the experimental observations.

) determined by the two methods is identical, at 0.038; the uncertainty on this average value, derived by propagation of experimental uncertainties in the individual order parameters, is 0.005. The correlation coefficient between the experimental and simulated order parameters is 0.83 for the complex protein and 0.47 for the apo-protein.
Figure 4
(b)). Several residues in the binding site display increases in flexibility upon binding, consistent with the trend seen throughout the rest of the molecule. Other binding site loops display a decrease in flexibility, more in keeping with the intuitive expectation that ligand binding will reduce the conformational freedom of binding site residues.
24

 This assumption is generally robust for globular, single-domain proteins, but might be called into question in the case of ABP, where flexibility of the domain hinge may result in a complex interaction between local protein conformation and rotational diffusion.
Table 1
). This suggests that inter-domain flexibility has only a minor influence on the measured relaxation rates. The orientation of the diffusion tensors for each domain is consistent with the RDC-derived structure of apo ABP, highlighting a consistency between the RDC and relaxation data that would not be expected if the relaxation data were influenced substantially by domain motions. Importantly, the Lipari–Szabo dynamic parameters derived from this analysis are identical, within error, with those of the initial analysis.

 = 188(± 37) kJ/mol at 308 K). Clearly, this latter value amounts to an overestimate, as the assumption of un-correlated motion is not likely to hold for all residues of the protein. It is evident, however, that the entropy change associated with the change in pico- to nanosecond dynamics contributes significantly to the favourable free energy of binding, and in effect amounts to protein dynamics paying some of the unfavourable entropic cost of ligand binding.
The experimental data available for this system is limited to probes of backbone dynamics. Given the good agreement between experiment and the molecular dynamics simulations, it is perhaps reasonable to infer something of the side-chain dynamics from these simulations. We observe considerably more variability in side-chain order parameters than is evident for the backbone, consistent with findings in other proteins. Furthermore, there is much greater variability in the change in order parameter observed upon ligand binding. Despite this, the changes in side-chain dynamics are broadly similar to those seen for the backbone, with the majority of residues showing a small increase in flexibility on ligand binding. As fast side-chain dynamics are correlated with local backbone dynamics only weakly, this suggests an additional source of favourable entropy change accompanying binding. A number of residues around the binding site show larger changes in dynamics on binding, reflective of both increases and decreases in flexibility. These changes reflect similar heterogeneous dynamic changes seen in the protein backbone of the loops that comprise the binding site.

We are actively exploring the mechanism of this phenomenon in ABP, and the contribution of other degrees of freedom to the binding entropy, particularly ligand and protein side-chain dynamics.

Default Xplor-NIH parameters were used throughout, and force constants were ramped using default values. Square-well potentials were used for all RDC constraints.

 For ABP–galactose, an axially symmetric diffusion tensor produces an optimal fit, while the fit to the apo ABP data is improved significantly by the use of a fully anisotropic diffusion tensor. Similar results were obtained using data collected at each field strength.
