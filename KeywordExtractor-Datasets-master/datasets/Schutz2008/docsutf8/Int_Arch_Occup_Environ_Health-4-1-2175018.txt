Objective
To study differences between working and sick-listed chronic repetitive strain injury (RSI) patients in the Netherlands with respect to indices of quality of life and illness perception.

Methods
P
-values < 0.01 were considered significant.

Results
Data from 1,121 questionnaires were used. Two-thirds of the respondents worked and one-third were sick-listed. Average duration of complaints was over 5 years in both groups. The sick-listed patients reported significantly more severe and extensive complaints than did the working patients. In addition, sick-listed patients reported significantly poorer mental health, physical (role) functioning, emotional role functioning, pain, vitality, and work-ability. With respect to illness perception, both groups showed the same concerns about their complaints, but sick-listed patients had significantly more distorted perceptions in their emotional response, identity, treatment control, personal control, timeline, and life consequences. Complaint-related decrease in quality of life was 31% in the working patients and 49% in the sick-listed patients.

Conclusion
The study found a greater number and severe complaints among sick-listed chronic RSI patients and a considerably decreased quality of life because of their complaints. These findings may allow for a better treatment focus in the future.

). Therefore, in 2005 a study that aimed to describe the working vs. sick-listed RSI patients’ perspectives in the Netherlands with respect to their complaints, quality of life, and illness perception was begun in a large group of chronic RSI patients.

Methods
Population
Patients with RSI were identified by approaching all 3,250 members of the Dutch RSI patients’ association. The Dutch RSI patient association was started 11 years ago. In the Netherlands, patients with the same disease are allowed and administratively helped by Governmental Services to join and start an association. Their goal is to gather and spread relevant information to all patients with the same disease in The Netherlands. In addition, their input in sickness-related policy matters is increasingly asked for. Members that were registered in March 2005 were eligible for inclusion. This group defined the study population in this cross-sectional study.

Data collection
In April 2005 questionnaires were sent by the secretariat of the RSI patients’ association to the home addresses of all their current members. An accompanying letter was included from the patients’ association. Patients were requested to complete a set of self-report measures. Return envelopes that were addressed directly to the research institute were included as well. One week later, a reminder letter was sent to all members. Data collection was stopped four weeks after sending the reminder. A total of 1,185 (36%) questionnaires were returned by mail.

). VBBA subscale scores ranged between 0 and 100, with higher scores being more unfavourable.
In order to compare the two groups of RSI patients, we classified the “working” group as those patients that had been present at their work for a minimum of 8 h during the previous week, and the “sick-listed” group were RSI patients with a sickness absence certificate following the Dutch social system (i.e. longer than 1 year sick-listed, or those that stated that they did not work according to their contract hours during the previous week before they filled in the questionnaire).

RSI patients in the sick-listed group were two years older on average, and this group contained a relatively higher proportion of women and lower proportion of highly educated persons. In the sick-listed group, 76% was sick-listed longer than one year.
In both groups, complaints were present for several years and extended over several upper body regions. In both groups, over 85% received a diagnostic label, provided by a medical professional, that belong to the umbrella term RSI. With respect to complaint-related variables, the patients in the sick-listed group reported significantly more pain in more regions, and they reported more stiffness/tingling complaints. The sick-listed group reported significantly lower ability to work, and no differences between groups were found in the psychosocial work characteristics experienced. With respect to co-morbidity, no other diseases were reported by 46% in the sick-listed group compared to 64% in the working group; depression and burnout were reported by 12 and 11% in the sick-listed group versus 6 and 5% in the working group. In the working patient group, 35% filled some kind of administrative function, 11% worked in IT, 10% worked in a physical job, and 10% in a management function. In both groups, almost 80% reported long- or short-term overexertion during work as the only main cause of the onset of their illness.

With the exception of the dimension timeline and comprehensibility, there was a significant difference in the six other illness perception dimensions between the two groups. Clinically relevant differences between the two groups to the detriment of the sick-listed RSI patients were found for the illness perception dimensions of “consequences”, “personal-” and “treatment-control”, and “identity”.

Discussion
The aim of the present study was to describe working vs. sick-listed RSI patients’ perspectives in the Netherlands in 2005 with respect to their complaints, quality of life, and illness perception. The sick-listed RSI patients reported more severe and extensive complaints in the upper extremity, but the long duration (6 years) of their complaints was comparable to the working RSI patients. The sick-listed patients, however, experienced a considerably more decreased quality of life because of their complaints, as well as more distorted illness perceptions.

). If an average difference of over 1 on a 0–10 point scale is considered clinically relevant, illness consequences, personal control, treatment control, and identity (i.e. the number of symptoms because of the illness) clearly differed between sick-listed and working RSI patients. We believe that it would be useful to focus future informational treatment strategies in the sick-listed patient group on changing their illness perception.

). In addition, comparisons between two groups of this specific group of patients were reported upon for this study. Summarizing, besides its possible shortcomings, this study is thought to be unique with respect to studying a large group of chronic RSI patients as most of the published literature on work-related upper extremity musculoskeletal disorders deal with acute and sub-acute populations.

This study was performed in cooperation with the Dutch RSI patients’ association. We would like to thank their scientific board and all the patients who were willing to share their experiences.
