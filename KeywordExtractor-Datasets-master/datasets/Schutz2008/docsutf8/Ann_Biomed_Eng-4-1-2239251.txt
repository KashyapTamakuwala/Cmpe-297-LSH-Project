Effective stabilization of the sacroiliac joints (SIJ) is essential, since spinal loading is transferred via the SIJ to the coxal bones, and further to the legs. We performed a biomechanical analysis of SIJ stability in terms of reduced SIJ shear force in standing posture using a validated static 3-D simulation model. This model contained 100 muscle elements, 8 ligaments, and 8 joints in trunk, pelvis, and upper legs. Initially, the model was set up to minimize the maximum muscle stress. In this situation, the trunk load was mainly balanced between the coxal bones by vertical SIJ shear force. An imposed reduction of the vertical SIJ shear by 20% resulted in 70% increase of SIJ compression force due to activation of hip flexors and counteracting hip extensors. Another 20% reduction of the vertical SIJ shear force resulted in further increase of SIJ compression force by 400%, due to activation of the transversely oriented M. transversus abdominis and pelvic floor muscles. The M. transversus abdominis crosses the SIJ and clamps the sacrum between the coxal bones. Moreover, the pelvic floor muscles oppose lateral movement of the coxal bones, which stabilizes the position of the sacrum between the coxal bones (the pelvic arc). Our results suggest that training of the M. transversus abdominis and the pelvic floor muscles could help to relieve SI-joint related pelvic pain.

 This simulation model calculates forces in muscles, ligaments, and joints that are needed to counterbalance trunk weight and other external forces. It was shown that this simulation model underestimated antagonistic muscle activity, but a good agreement was found for agonist muscle activity. The number of passive structures in the model was small, for example no joint capsules were incorporated. Therefore, the model was only valid for postures in which none of the joints were near an end position. The aim of the present study was to determine which muscles have to become active in the 3-D pelvic simulation model when there is an imposed reduction of the vertical SIJ shear force.

Simulations and Data Analyses

;

Lowering of the maximum vertical SIJ shear force must result in reduction of the total SIJ shear force (combination of vertical and horizontal shear);

Ligament force must not exceed 250 N.



A muscle was included for further analysis when it produced at least 15% of the maximum muscle stress during the simulation. For all muscles, the maximum muscle stress depended on the calculated minimum muscle stress (see optimization criterion 1 in the Appendix). Two muscle groups were analyzed separately: (1) the muscles that increased at least 80% in force after the first simulation step and (2) the muscles that increased at least 10 times in force after completion of the simulation series.

c. The MM. gluteus medius and minimus contributed to some extent to this increased compression due to a distinct force component in the transverse direction. To maintain force equilibrium, increased SIJ compression led to loading of the iliolumbar and posterior sacroiliac ligaments to the preset maximum value of 250 N.

 This muscle is considered as one of the self-bracing muscles of the SIJ. It was hypothesized that when standing on one leg, the shear load on the contralateral SIJ is diminished. Posterior tilt of the pelvis with less lumbar lordosis may than lead to less M. psoas major muscle load on the spine meaning less shear load on the SIJ. These findings indirectly support our findings that transversely oriented muscles reduce SIJ shear forces. We emphasize that the present model served as a tool to investigate the general relations between muscle and ligament forces in the pelvic region. The present simulations results may lead to the development of a new SIJ stabilizing training-program to reduce pain induced by high SIJ shear forces. The effectiveness of such a program, however, can only be tested with an intervention study.

 In the future, we intend to extend the model with co-contraction between the M. transversus abdominis, the M. multifidus, and the pelvic floor muscles to study prevention of (over)loading of pelvic ligaments at different static postures.

Conclusions
Effective stabilization of the SIJ is essential in transferring spinal load via the SIJ to the coxal bones and the legs. A biomechanical analysis of the upright standing posture showed that activation of transversely oriented abdominal M. transversus abdominis and pelvic floor, i.e., M. coccygeus and M. pubo- and iliococcygeus muscles would be an effective strategy to reduce vertical SIJ shear force and thus to increase SIJ stability. The force equilibrium in this situation induced loading of the iliolumbar and posterior sacroiliac ligaments. The M. transversus abdominis crosses the SIJ and clamps the sacrum between the coxal bones. Moreover, the pelvic floor muscles oppose lateral movement of the coxal bones, which stabilizes the position of the sacrum (the pelvic arc).

b. The simulation model quantifies the muscle, ligament, and joint forces to warrant force equilibrium of the complete model. In the present study, the trunk load is the only external force applied. It is also possible to include an external reaction force as a backing support. The trunk load transfers from the lumbar spine, via the pelvis to the lower legs on the basis of the prescribed posture. The static equilibrium equations for the trunk, the coxal bones, and the sacrum are based on a free-body diagram of each part. All forces and moments exerted on each part, including the weight, the external loads, the muscle, and ligament forces, and the joint reaction forces, have to be in equilibrium. Reaction forces in joints balance the other forces. The trunk has a reaction force in the L5-S1 joint, the sacrum has additional reaction forces in the SIJ, and the two coxal bones have reaction forces in the SIJ and the hip joints. In the present study we focus on the vertical SIJ shear forces. These are the net sum of trunk load, muscle, and ligament forces, and reaction forces acting in vertical direction on the vertebrae, the sacrum, and the coxal bones. Reaction forces are calculated in this order, that is starting with the trunk and ending with the ground reaction force (which is not given as output of the model). Leaving out the ground reaction forces on the feet does not mean that the model floats: these forces are just not needed in the equilibrium equations of the trunk, the pelvis, and the femurs.

Force Vector Optimization Scheme

 was used to determine the optimum solution for the forces. It calculated the magnitudes of 130 force vectors based on a preset load (e.g., the trunk load) using first a linear and second a quadratic optimization criterion. Since the present study focused on static postures, the first linear criterion was as follows:
The maximum muscle stress was minimized. The upper limit for muscle stress valid for all muscles was minimized, which was considered as maximizing the endurance time. This criterion only minimized muscle stresses, not the ligament forces. The ligament and joint reaction forces were just part of the optimum solution for the muscle forces.



This criterion did not necessarily lead to a unique solution. For example: in case a trunk muscle, e.g., the M. erector spinae determined the lowest possible value for the maximum muscle stress, still an infinite number of solutions may exist for balancing muscle forces around the hip. Thus, a supplementary, quadratic criterion was used:
The sum of squared muscle stresses was minimized, with the additional constraint that no muscle stress was allowed to exceed the value that followed from the first criterion. This led to distribution of the load over synergic muscles within the boundary of the first criterion. However, strictly upholding this additional constraint led to unrealistic activity of muscles when a small decrease of the maximum muscle stress was achieved by recruiting many muscles. In addition, this second criterion could enhance the increase of ligament forces, since the constraint was only applied to muscle stresses. To prevent that ligament forces became too high, the maximum muscle stress was allowed to exceed the calculated lowest maximum muscle stress from the first criterion by 10%. This increase of the maximum stress was allowed to reduce the recruitment of inefficient muscles, but it also tempered excessive loading of ligament forces.

) and calculated muscle stresses at different hip flexion angles showed good proportionality (correlation coefficient of 0.904). This was not the case for the activity of the M. quadratus lumborum (slightly higher EMG value) and the M. erector spinae (slightly lower EMG value). Overall, a good agreement was found for agonist muscle activity, but antagonistic muscle activity was underestimated. The aim of the present model was the development of a tool to investigate the general relations between muscle and ligament forces in the pelvic region, rather than to focus on the contribution of individual muscles. To enable the use of EMG data as input in the model, a facility was made to define upper and lower limits for each muscle force vector. It also provides the possibility to simulate co-contraction of antagonistic muscles in the pelvic region. A similar facility was made for ligament and joint reaction forces. In the present study, the ligament forces were not allowed to exceed a maximum of 250 N.
