 of 0.68. The model correctly predicted two patients who were unable to obtain a posttreatment AHI of 10 or less. This study was designed to demonstrate two models of collaboration between a dental sleep medicine specialist and a sleep medicine physician in the monitoring of a patient treated with a MAD. The outcome data suggest that the limited channel recording system can be used as an alternative to laboratory polysomnography to reduce the cost of MAD treatment, and to improve the quality and consistency of posttreatment patient care.

The primary goal of this study was to use a self-applied limited channel recorder to objectively assess the effectiveness of MAD therapy when the dentist determined the patient had reached the titration endpoint. A second goal was to determine factors which might predict successful treatment outcomes and provide a more refined method for identifying patients who may be appropriate for MAD therapy as the initial treatment option. Finally, we wanted to demonstrate two potential models of collaboration between the dentist and sleep medicine physician in monitoring MAD treatment outcomes.

Materials and methods
Eleven females and 19 males were recruited from two dental practices before treatment with an oral appliance and enrolled in the study. Twenty-five of the patients had failed CPAP therapy. After obtaining an informed consent (approved by the BioMed IRB, San Diego, CA, USA) patients completed a two-night pretreatment in-home study with the Apnea Risk Evaluation System (ARES TM) Unicorder  TM (Advanced Brain Monitoring, Carlsbad, CA, USA). This pretreatment recording was conducted between the time the dental impressions were taken and when the TAP II Mandibular Advancement Device (MAD) (Airway Management, Dallas, TX, USA) was fabricated and ready for insertion.
The TAP is a custom-made oral appliance with separate upper and lower appliances joined by a titration or advancement mechanism on the upper and a transverse bar or socket on the lower. The titration mechanism uses a hook to engage the bar or socket on the lower once each device is placed in the mouth. A jackscrew controls the position of the hook and thus the amount of protrusion. The patient can self-titrate the device using a removable hex key which engages the screw.
On the day of insertion of the MAD, patients completed the Beck depression index, Epworth sleepiness scale, and the Flemons’ quality of life questionnaire. At the insertion appointment, both study sites attempted to achieve a starting MAD titration position whereby the patient could just hook the lower tray with the upper tray using active protrusion with both trays in place. In the rare occasion that this level of advancement was not tolerated by the patient, the starting protrusion was reduced. Patients were instructed to begin adjusting the MAD in one-half turn increments as soon as it was tolerable, until a cessation in snoring or the symptoms had resolved. As a result, the titration endpoint was determined by the dentist based on the patient’s self-report. At the follow-up appointment, which was typically scheduled 3 to 4 weeks subsequent to the MAD insertion, the assessment questionnaires were completed again and the ARES Unicorder study was repeated. Twenty-seven of the 30 patients reached their endpoint within 34 days. The other three patients completed their endpoint in 40, 61, and 75 days; the delay in reaching the endpoint was due to patient illness unrelated to this study.
In between the time that treatment was initiated and the titration endpoint, each patient maintained a daily journal that recorded the time the appliance was inserted each night, and the time it was removed in the morning.

]. Using a diagnostic AHI cutoff of >10, the concurrent in-lab comparison yielded a sensitivity of 97.4, a specificity of 85.6, a positive predictive value of 93.6, and a negative predictive value of 93.9. The in-home comparison sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 91.5, 85.7, 91.5, and 85.7, respectively. The failure rate was 2%.

].
Automated scoring algorithms were applied off-line to detect sleep disordered breathing. The AHI was computed using a time-in-bed measure based on recording time with acceptable signal quality minus periods when the patient was upright or presumed to be awake based on actigraphy. Apneas, based on a 10-s cessation of airflow detected by the automated algorithms, were included in all apnea–hypopnea indexes (AHI). Hypopnea events required a 50% reduction and recovery in airflow and were further stratified based on the depth of desaturation. The AHI-4% criteria required a minimum 3.5% reduction in SpO2 and at least a 1.0% recovery. Hypopneas included in the AHI-3% and AHI-1% criteria required SpO2 desaturation and resaturation using stepped thresholds. For the AHI-3%, if the SpO2 at the point of maximum saturation before the event was greater than or equal to 95% then a 2.2% reduction and a 2.2% recovery in SpO2 was required. For maximum saturations of between 95–93% the required SpO2 change was a 2.5% reduction and 2.5% recovery; between 93–91% a 3.0% reduction and 2.7% recovery; between 91–88% a 3.5% reduction and 3.0% recovery; and below 88% a 4.0% reduction and 3.5% recovery. For the AHI-1%, if the point of maximum saturation before the event was greater than 93%, then a 1.0% reduction and 1.0% recovery was required; and for events with a starting SpO2 between 93–91%, a 1.2% reduction and 1.2% recovery was required. For an AHI-1% event to be called, the change in flow and desaturation needed to be associated with a behavioral arousal (i.e., an abrupt change in pulse rate, snoring sound or a head movement). After the automated scoring was applied, the full disclosure recordings were visually inspected by a sleep medicine physician to confirm the accuracy of the automated scoring, and to reclassify as central and/or exclude autodetected events if necessary. At the time of the review, the clinician was blinded to the study status (i.e., pre- or posttreatment). The physiological data, including AHI values, percent time with SpO2 below 90, 85, and 80%, and percentage time snoring greater than 30, 40, 50, and 60 dB were then calculated.

To develop and validate the prediction of the posttreatment AHI using pretreatment data, patients were paired and assigned into either the model development or cross validation group based on similarities in the pre- and post-4% AHI and 1% AHI. Correlation analysis was used to identify anthropomorphic variables and measures of obstructive breathing before treatment which might be useful in estimating the posttreatment 4% AHI (post-T 4%). Variables with significant correlations were then used in a linear regression to derive predicted posttreatment values (predict AHI).

Daily self-reported compliance for the MAD revealed that out of a total of 693 nights in bed recorded across all subjects, only 20 nights were reported as not wearing the MAD. The mean usage per night was 7.34 ± 1.3 h. Three of the 30 patients had incomplete paperwork due to either confusion on the part of the patient or problems in collecting the paperwork at the study sites. Although all three patients said that they had worn the MAD for the duration of the study, there was no written record available that allowed the investigators to assess compliance/usage.

Discussion
Consecutive patients who were referred to the dentist for a MAD were provided the opportunity to enroll in the study. The only exclusion criteria applied were ages less than 18 or older than 70 years. The inclusion of 25 subjects who had previously failed CPAP therapy contributed to the wide OSA severity range: nine of the subjects (30%) were considered to have severe OSA (i.e., AHI-4% ≥ 30) and an additional 30% were considered to have moderate OSA (AHI-4%>15 and <30). Seventy-seven percent of the patients (23/30) had at AHI-1%>25, a clinical cut-off which was considered at least moderate.
In this study, a treatment efficacy rate for the MAD was 90% using an AHI-4% clinical cut-off of 10, and 97% when a 50% reduction in AHI was included in determining a successful outcome. Eighty-seven percent of the patients showed improvement using an AHI-1% with a clinical cut-off of 15 or a 50% reduction in AHI. Eighty percent of the patients (24/30) had a posttreatment AHI-1% ≤ 16.

]. Using a definition of treatment success that required achieving a posttreatment respiratory disturbance index below 10, success was achieved on average across all studies for 52% of patients treated with oral appliances. When the more liberal criteria of a 50% reduction in RDI were applied to assess outcome, 65% of patients were shown to have a positive result with MAD.
In an attempt to compare these previous finding to this data set, a clinical cut-off of 10 was applied to the AHI-1%. The differences between the AHI-1% and RDI include a 50% reduction in flow vs 30%; a 1% desaturation vs no desaturation; arousal indicators based on changes in snoring, pulse rate, and head movement vs cortical arousals; and the use of time-in-bed vs total-sleep-time. Using this alternative clinical cut-off, 33% of the patients had a successful outcome. When a 50% reduction in AHI-1% was included, 77% had a successful outcome. Results are more consistent with the previous research.

r
 = 0.63) between posttreatment % time snoring >30 dB and the posttreatment AHI-4% suggests that the current clinical practice of relying on residual snoring to asses MAD titration is valid. It is interesting to note that there was no apparent correlation between snoring levels and pretreatment AHI values. Given the discrepancy between the self-reported and objectively measured snoring at the titration endpoint, it appears that the bed-partner or patient’s observation may not provide the most accurate means for titrating a MAD.

]. Supine positionality did not appear to influence the treatment outcome in our study, possibly, because there were so few MAD treatment failures. This may be a result of the appliance which was used or that the small sample size was not representative of the population treated with oral appliances.
14
.
 In this study, compliance was only monitored during the titration period which may have contributed to the favorable finding (i.e., 97%). Other factors that may have influenced this outcome were a relatively small sample size and/or patient compensation being provided. Given that 80% of the study participants were CPAP failures, the influence of prior CPAP use on MAD compliance should be explored. While an objective measure of MAD compliance would eliminate potential bias contributed by self-reported use, practical methods are not currently available.

]. Weight and neck circumference also appeared to influence the posttreatment apnea/hypopnea index. These variables make sense: the upper airway tends to be narrower in patients with more fatty tissue around the neck and the additional mass combines with gravity to contribute to greater collapsibility when sleeping supine.
The successful treatment outcome of patients with severe sleep apnea suggests that a more quantitative approach should be investigated to identify candidates appropriate for a MAD therapy. The results from the predictive model, once fully validated, could provide the guidance needed for sleep medicine physicians to recommend an oral appliance as an initial treatment option for more severe patients. Alternatively, substantial differences between the predicted and actual posttreatment AHI could help dentists determine when a patient has not been fully titrated.
n

 suggested additional variables would be predictive. It is expected that the error between the predicted and actual posttreatment AHI can be reduced with larger data sets. In addition to expanding the database used for the predictive model, future investigations should be conducted to determine if the accuracy of the predictive model is influenced by the type of MAD.

].
A follow-up PSG is generally not affordable in cases where it is not covered by an insurance company or health ministry; sleep centers do not tend to offer less expensive level III studies as an alternative. This creates a situation whereby treatment outcomes are simply not assessed, or the dentist conducts the study independently, without the assistance or oversight of the sleep medicine professional. Left on their own, many dentists rely upon oximetry and other level IV devices to monitor treatment outcomes, in part because of their limited experience in interpreting the more sophisticated signals obtained by level III devices. Although several level III devices have automated scoring algorithms, the physiological data should still be reviewed by a trained professional. In two patients, the review of the full disclosure recording allowed recognition of complex sleep apnea (i.e., central sleep apnea was revealed posttreatment after the obstructive breathing was resolved) suggesting the importance of having an experienced professional review the data. This study suggests an alternative approach for assessing MAD treatment outcomes that is based on a collaborative relationship between dentists and sleep medicine physician using a limited channel recording system.
