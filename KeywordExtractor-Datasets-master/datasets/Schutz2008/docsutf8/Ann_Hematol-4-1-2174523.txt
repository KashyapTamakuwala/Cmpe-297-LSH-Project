 items (concordance was analysed by weighted kappa index), and a systematic analysis of the potential biases of each study was assessed. We carried out the meta-analysis with the data extracted from the studies. We recovered eight cases-control studies. The relation between the antecedent of a long travel and subsequent VTED varied from OR = 1.1 to OR = 4.0 and was found to be significant in four studies. The studies were highly heterogeneous in methodology and so the results obtained about the relation between the long travel and the VTED and the score at SIGN50. Two meta-analysis were carried out: only with travels by plane in which the relation was not significant (OR = 1.21; CI 95%, 0.95–1.55) and with all types of transport, with a slightly significant relation (OR = 1.46; CI95%, 1.24–1.72). We may deduce from this systematic review that there does exist a weak association between episodes of VTED and a long travel, but not by plane specifically. The heterogeneity and the methodological quality of the studies published preclude of more robust conclusions.

Our objective was to carry out a systematic review and meta-analysis of case-control studies to analyse the association between long travels and the development of VTED.

Materials and methods
We carried out a bibliographic search using a combination of keywords and MeSH headings in the Medline, Embase and Cochrane Library bibliographic databases. We selected only case-control studies, in any language, with no limit on the date of publication, and performed a cross search of the references cited in these studies. The corresponding author named in each study was requested to inform us of any relevant data that had not been described in the original manuscript.

 indexes.
We also analysed the limitations and potential biases that might reduce the validity of the studies examined. The sources of bias analysed were grouped into three categories: exposure misclassification (recall bias), selection bias (including detection bias, effect misclassification, survival bias, self-selection bias and Berkson’s bias) and confounding factors. Memory bias was defined as the fact that when subjects know they have suffered VTED, it makes them more likely to remember prior exposure to the antecedent of a long travel. Effect misclassification was minimised by considering only those studies in which VTED was diagnosed by objective complementary examination. Detection bias was suspected when the odds ratio (OR) in the days immediately after the travel was less than that corresponding to subsequent days. We only selected data published for VTED incidence at 30 days after the travel because was the time lapse most frequently analysed in the studies. Survival bias was considered to be that occurring when the study included prevalent cases, which could give rise to confounding of the variables related to the origin and those concerning the prognosis of the disease. Self-selection bias was considered to be present if the controls participated on their own initiative in the study and were not selected in a consecutive or random way; thus, they might be related to the results being sought. Berkson’s bias would be derived from the use of hospital patients as controls.
The confounding factors were judged to be influential if no account were taken of the possibility that the exposure factor and the disease might be related through a third variable which was related to each of the other two.

] and Der Simonian–Laird tests, and fixed and random effects methods were used, respectively, for the cases of homogeneity and heterogeneity between the studies. We assessed possible publication bias using Begg and Egger tests and carried out a sensitivity analysis by evaluating the influence of the absence of each individual study on the global measure of association of all the other studies.

], the controls selected were not derived from the same population as that of the cases; the means of transport and the duration of the travel, as well as the type of VTED episode evaluated were different in all the studies; and, in general, no multivariate or stratified analysis was carried out to attribute the increased risk of developing an episode of VTED to the long travel.

]. Another possibility could be to adjust for this variable (which might be considered that of comorbidity) by means of multivariate analysis.
Given the methodological heterogeneity of the published studies of cases and controls, it was not possible to carry out a detailed meta-analysis of different aspects of the relation under study, and so its scope was limited to those studies that assessed the association between DVT or between DVT and PE and prolonged travels by plane or by any other form of transport. In any case, the association that was found in the latter case was only weak, and there was a large degree of variation in the methodological quality applied in the various studies.

].
The methodological quality of the studies examined in this systematic review means that we must be cautious concerning the results reported. Although there does seem to be a likely relation between a long travel and the development of an episode of VTED, such an association must be of such a magnitude that a small bias or modification to the study could increase or decrease the strength of the association recorded.
In conclusion, we may deduce from this systematic review that there does exist a real, but weak, association between episodes of VTED and the antecedent of a lengthy travel, and this relation with the travels by plane is only nearly significant. The heterogeneity and the methodological quality of the studies published on the question limit the robustness of the conclusions obtained.
