The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is separated from the photoreceptor outer segments by the subretinal space. While the actual volume of this space is minimal, the communication that occurs across this microenvironment is important to the visual process, and accumulating evidence suggests the purines ATP and adenosine contribute to this communication. P1 and P2 receptors are localized to membranes on both the photoreceptor outer segments and on the apical membrane of the RPE which border subretinal space. ATP is released across the apical membrane of the RPE into this space in response to various triggers including glutamate and chemical ischemia. This ATP is dephosphorylated into adenosine by a series of ectoenzymes on the RPE apical membrane. Regulation of release and ectoenzyme activity in response to light-sensitive signals can alter the balance of purines in subretinal space, and thus coordinate communication across subretinal space with the visual process.

) by a series of ectonucleotidases present on the apical membrane of the RPE. By controlling the balance of extracellular purines available to stimulate these receptors these mechanisms can control levels of endogenous purines available to activate the receptors. While theoretically possible, it remains to be determined whether these subretinal purines can actually stimulate photoreceptors

Regulation of purine levels in subretinal space
While synthesized purinergic agonists may prove useful in treating some ocular disorders, the endogenous activation of P1 and P2 receptors in the subretinal microenvironment will ultimately be determined by availability of agonists. These levels are largely controlled by the release of ATP into the subretinal space, its conversion into other purines including adenosine, and the manipulation of adenosine by enzymes or transporters. Recent work has increased our understanding of both the stimuli that initiate changes in subretinal purine levels and the mechanisms that mediate these changes.

] and may reflect the multiple roles of purinergic signaling within a given tissue. As both stimuli lead to release across the apical membrane into subretinal space, both are expected to influence signaling in the microenvironment.

Interconversion of purines in subretinal space
The interconversion of nucleotides and nucleosides each capable of stimulating distinct receptors makes the purinergic signaling system of particular interest in a confined region such as the subretinal space. The main enzymes responsible for dephosphorylating extracellular ATP on the RPE cells have been analyzed and a basic understanding of their regulation has begun. This section first describes the enzymes that act on ATP and ADP, followed by enzymes which convert AMP into adenosine.

 receptors on photoreceptor outer segments. The impact of purinergic signaling on chronic ocular diseases is also of interest, such as the role of ischemia-driven ATP release in VEGF production. While the small size of subretinal space can complicate pharmacologic manipulation within the intact RPE-photoreceptor complex, molecular approaches may provide new insight into how endogenous purines in subretinal space affect the physiology, and pathophysiology, of both RPE and photoreceptors.
