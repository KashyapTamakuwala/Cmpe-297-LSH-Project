Raman spectroscopy is a versatile technique that has frequently been applied for the investigation of art objects. By using mobile Raman instrumentation it is possible to investigate the artworks without the need for sampling. This work evaluates the use of a dedicated mobile spectrometer for the investigation of a range of museum objects in museums in Scotland, including antique Egyptian sarcophagi, a panel painting, painted surfaces on paper and textile, and the painted lid and soundboard of an early keyboard instrument. The investigations of these artefacts illustrate some analytical challenges that arise when analysing museum objects, including fluorescing varnish layers, ambient sunlight, large dimensions of artefacts and the need to handle fragile objects with care. Analysis of the musical instrument (the Mar virginals) was undertaken in the exhibition gallery, while on display, which meant that interaction with the public and health and safety issues had to be taken into account.

In this work we evaluate the use of a mobile fibre-optic-based Raman instrument to perform investigations in a museum context. Different types of artefacts were investigated in a variety of locations, testing and demonstrating the flexibility in instrumental set-up. In particular the experimental conditions during the examination of a virginals on exhibition were challenging. Instrument stability after travelling overseas (between Belgium and Edinburgh, UK) was also thoroughly evaluated.

The examination of Egyptian sarcophagi, both in the National Museums of Scotland (Edinburgh) and in the Burrell Collection (Glasgow Museums & Art Gallery) illustrate the comparative ease of transportation of the instrument. The capability of the technique to analyse pigments on artefacts covered by a thick varnish layer as well as to undertake the investigation with interference from sunlight are shown. During the examination of a Renaissance painted panel (one of the panels from Dean house, Edinburgh), strong inteference from a fluorescing varnish layer was also encountered. The possibilities of the technique for the non-invasive investigation of fragile artefacts on paper are illustrated by the yellow pigment identification on Indian Kalighat paintings and on a painted textile banner. During the latter survey the articulating arm was used to allow analysis of a large artefact displayed horizontally. Finally, working in the galleries represented an interesting experience as it involved undertaking analytical research whilst taking into account ambient conditions and visitors’ curiosity. This approach is illustrated by the study of the Mar virginals.

] indeed identified Egyptian blue with FT Raman spectroscopy (although the sample did not come from exactly the same area), so this illustrates one of the disadvantages of using mobile equipment. In contrast to many laboratory instruments, mobile instrumentation is usually equipped with a single laser, which makes it impossible to switch to another laser wavelength to overcome fluorescence interference.

]. The panel representing the sense of hearing (KL 72) is exhibited on a wall, at a height of about 3 m, which would have required the construction of scaffolding in the gallery. Therefore it was considered more practical to remove the panel temporarily from the exhibition and bring it to the conservation lab for analysis. The painted surface was found to be covered with a varnish layer, which contributed to the fluorescence background, although it still was possible to identify the pigments in the investigated areas of the artefact.

). Under the ambient conditions of the conservation laboratory, which did not have full light exclusion, and using the 785-nm laser, it was impossible to obtain a spectrum of sufficient quality to identify the green areas on the artefact. One solution to overcome this problem would be to use a Raman instrument with a different laser, with a smaller absorption cross section for the green pigments.

. 1560 and 1660, and its lid and soundboard contain three separate painted panels, the central one depicting Orpheus playing to the animals. We wished to compare the paintings on the lid to those on the soundboard, since similar or different pigment compositions may support or disprove the idea that the lid is contemporary to the virginals.
This artefact had to be analysed while on display in the museum gallery, which enabled us to evaluate the feasibility of undertaking the analytical work in a public space. It was necessary to ensure that there were no health and safety risks, especially from direct or scattered light from the laser beam, as well as keeping the electronics and power supply cables and units away from enquiring fingers. The visiting public were clearly intrigued with what was going on and to help explain this, a poster informed the visitors about the experiments.

], are needed to be more definite. Since the investigation of this rare musical instrument was performed in one day, time was confined and only a limited number of areas could be examined. In fact, except for the absence of lead–tin yellow, none of the pigments were rare for an artwork of this period.


Conclusions
This work reports on the application of mobile Raman spectroscopy to the non-invasive investigation of a range of object of arts in a museum context. The different cases presented here illustrate different obstacles and analytical challenges that are often encountered during direct Raman investigations of museum objects. The investigation of two antique Egyptian sarcophagi shows the possibilities of the technique to deal with artefacts covered by a thick varnish layer as well as the investigation with the interference of ambient sunlight in the conservation laboratory. The investigation of the Dean House panel illustrates the possibilities of pigment investigation although a fluorescing varnish layer is present; the suitability of the method to analyse fragile artefacts was demonstrated by the investigation of Indian Kalighat paintings on paper; the textile banner was both fragile and large. Finally, the Mar virginals has been examined for the first time directly in the exhibition gallery with normal lighting conditions and with visitors present. All these examples illustrate that non-destructive, mobile Raman spectroscopy is able to cover a broad field of research questions on artistic and historical objects, in a range of different experimental conditions, encountered in a museum context.
