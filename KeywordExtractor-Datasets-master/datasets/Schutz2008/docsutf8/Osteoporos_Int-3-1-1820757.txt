Introduction and hypothesis
Epidemiological observations suggest links between osteoporosis and risk of acute cardiovascular events and vice versa. Whether the two clinical conditions are linked by common pathogenic factors or atherosclerosis per se remains incompletely understood. We investigated whether serum lipids and polymorphism in the ApoE gene modifying serum lipids could be a biological linkage.

Methods
This was an observational study including 1176 elderly women 60–85 years old. Women were genotyped for epsilon (ɛ) allelic variants of the ApoE gene, and data concerning serum lipids (total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL-C, LDL-C, apoA1, ApoB, Lp(a)), hip and spine BMD, aorta calcification (AC), radiographic vertebral fracture and self-reported wrist and hip fractures, cardiovascular events together with a wide array of demographic and lifestyle characteristics were collected.

Results
Presence of the ApoE ɛ4 allele had a significant impact on serum lipid profile, yet no association with spine/hip BMD or AC could be established. In multiple regression models, apoA1 was a significant independent contributor to the variation in AC. However, none of the lipid components were independent contributors to the variation in spine or hip BMD. When comparing the women with or without vertebral fractures, serum triglycerides showed significant differences. This finding was however not applicable to hip or wrist fractures. After adjustment for age, severe AC score (≥6) and/or manifest cardiovascular disease increased the risk of hip but not vertebral or wrist fractures.

Conclusion
The contribution of serum lipids to the modulators of BMD does not seem to be direct but rather indirect via promotion of atherosclerosis, which in turn can affect bone metabolism locally, especially when skeletal sites supplied by end-arteries are concerned. Further studies are needed to explore the genetic or environmental risk factors underlying the association of low triglyceride levels to vertebral fractures.

]. A possible explanation the discrepancies could be that the true driver of the association is obstructive vascular disease, meaning that the association of lipids to bone is not detectable before the severity of intraluminal lesions reaches a critical grade when blood supply to the anatomical region is considerably hampered. Until now there have been no epidemiological studies that investigated associations of lipids and lipoprotein components with bone independent of a direct surrogate of the atherosclerotic burden.
The aim of the present study was to test this hypothesis and investigate associations of a wide array of serum lipids and lipoproteins as well as of a genetic determinant of lipid profile with different surrogate measures of osteoporosis (BMD, fractures) and cardiovascular disease (AC, acute events) in 1176 Danish postmenopausal women providing full-set of data for such analyses.

Subjects and methods
Study population
20
]. This subpopulation was selected based on those whose BMD and body composition were measured by the same DXA scanner. The population characteristics were not statistically significant from the total PERF population indicating that the results reported herein are generally applicable to elderly Caucasian women 60–85 years old. None of the women received any approved antiresorptive treatment or any other drugs with known effect on bone mass for more than 1 year. Forty-two patients reporting ongoing treatment with lipid-lowering drugs was excluded when analyzing associations of allelic variation in the ApoE gene with lipid profile.
All women gave written their informed consent to participation and the study was carried out in compliance with the Helsinki Declaration II and the European Standards for Good Clinical Practice. The study protocol was approved by the local ethical committee.

Fracture diagnosis
Lateral X-rays of the thoracic and lumbar spine were performed using standard X-ray equipment. Vertebral deformities from T4 to L4 were assessed by digital measurements of vertebral deformations using the Image Pro Image Analyzer software (version 4.5 for windows, Media Cybernetics Inc., Silver Spring, MD, USA). The ratio of the anterior and posterior heights of each vertebral body was determined and a difference between the anterior and posterior edges exceeding 20% was considered as a radiographic vertebral fracture. Information on prevalent non-vertebral fractures (wrist, hip, humeral fracture, rib, ankle, and foot) was collected during personal interview and later verified by X-rays or hospital discharge summaries.

Laboratory parameters
Blood samples were collected in the morning after fasting overnight (>12 h). Serum total cholesterol, triglyceride, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol were determined by enzymatic assay using a Vitros-250 (Johnson & Johnson, Taastrup, Denmark). LDL cholesterol was calculated by Friedewald formula (LDL−C = TC−HDL−C−0.45 × TG). Lipoprotein(a), ApoA1, and ApoB were measured by the Cobas Mira (Hoffman-La Roche, Mannheim, Germany) automatic blood analyzer.

Statistical analysis
Results are presented as mean ± SD, unless otherwise indicated. Confounders of hip BMD and AC were identified by univariate correlation analysis. We classified ApoE genotypes into two categories marked by absence or presence of the ɛ4 allele. General linear models (GLM) tested the differences in selected dependent variables after adjustment for possible confounders. Similar approach was used to identify factors showing differences between women with or without fractures. Logistic regression models were established to assess the age-dependent and age-independent relative risk of wrist, hip, or vertebral fractures in women with advanced aorta calcification or cardiovascular disease. Statistical analyses were carried out using the SPSS data analysis software (version 12, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). All statistical tests were two-tailed and differences were considered significant if the p-value was less than 0.05.

. Women with fractures were on average older and had a tendency for being physically less active. However, no significant differences in BMI, body adiposity, or body fat distribution were apparent. In addition, no significant differences in a wide array of lifestyle factors were apparent.
When comparing the lipid profile of women with or without osteoporotic fractures after adjustment for potential confounders (i.e., age, years since menopause, BMI, TFM%, CFM/PFM ratio, smoking, ApoE ɛ4 allele, physical exercise, alcohol consumption, and severity score of AC), only triglycerides showed significant differences between the two groups (p < 0.05). Thus, triglycerides in women with and without fractures were 1.31 ± 0.04 mmol/l and 1.42 ± 0.03 mmol/l, respectively. When analyzing fracture types separately, the difference between women with or without hip or wrist fractures were not statistically significant.

Discussion
In the present study, we investigated whether serum lipid and lipoproteins represent a biological linkage between osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease. The main findings were as follows: 1) neither allelic polymorphism in the ApoE gene nor serum lipids per se were independent correlates of BMD at any skeletal site, 2) ApoA1 levels were independent correlates of AC, which seem to play a role in the determination of hip BMD, 3) decreased triglycerides were independently associated with vertebral fractures, but not with non-vertebral fractures (hip and wrist), and 4) advanced vascular disease was a significant contributor to risk of hip fractures, but not to vertebral or wrist fractures. These observations suggest that the role of lipids as linking factors between cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis is indirect via promotion of atherogenesis, which in turn can contribute to bone loss, especially at skeletal sites with end-arterial blood supply. Antiatherogenic measures can also be expected to contribute to decreasing the burden of hip fractures among the elderly.

]. Although traditional views considered obesity a protective factor due to endogenous estrogen production, these more recent findings emphasize that other factors deriving from adipose tissue, e.g., adipokines, inflammatory cytokines, and perhaps even lipids/lipoprotein metabolism are also to be taken into account. In addition, these findings also draw attention to the need of proper adjustment for overall adiposity and body fat distribution when addressing the direct implication of selected potential mediators.

]. Since triglycerides were not associated with spine BMD, their direct contribution to fracture risk, if any, is via modulation of bone quality or bone strength. Given the cross-sectional design of this study, we cannot exclude the possibility that a confounder or confounders of triglyceride levels, which was not considered herein is the actual modulator of bone fragility and hence fracture risk.

]. These observations provide strong support for the important role of atherosclerosis for the pathogenesis of osteoporosis in the proximal femur.
In summary, the results of the present observational study provide further evidence for the independent association of peripheral vascular disease with osteoporosis in the proximal femur. Since the association of lipids and lipoproteins to BMD and non-vertebral fractures is not independent of the severity of AC, it seems unlikely that these metabolites exert direct and clinically significant effects on bone turnover in postmenopausal women. Their contribution is via promotion of atherogenesis, in which regard ApoA1 levels seem to take a leading role. The remaining issue to be clarified is which genetic or environmental factors underlie the association of low triglycerides levels to vertebral fractures.
