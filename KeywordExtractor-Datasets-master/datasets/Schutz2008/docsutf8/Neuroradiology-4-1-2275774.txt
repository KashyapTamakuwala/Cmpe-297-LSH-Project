Intracranial angioplasty and stenting (ICAS) is a therapeutic option in symptomatic intracranial atherosclerotic disease. Adequate follow-up examination is necessary to exclude in-stent restenosis. Conventional intraarterial digital subtraction angiography (ia-DSA) is the current gold standard, but it is an invasive technique and carries the risk of neurological complications. Angiographic CT (ACT) is a new technique that provides a volume dataset of the highest spatial resolution and high contrast resolution derived from a rotational acquisition of a c-arm-mounted flat-panel detector. The feasibility of ACT with intravenous administration of contrast medium (iv-ACT) for follow-up after ICAS is demonstrated. In two patients iv-ACT was performed as a follow-up examination 12 months after ICAS. High-resolution volume data from the rotational acquisitions were processed to provide delineation of the stent lumen as well as imaging of the brain parenchyma and vessels. In both patients the patency of the stent lumen was assessed successfully. In addition, all other brain vessels were displayed in a manner similar to their appearance on CT angiograms. The brain parenchyma was also adequately imaged in a manner similar to its appearance on CT images. We demonstrated the feasibility and diagnostic value of iv-ACT for follow-up imaging after ICAS. This new application has the potential to become the imaging method of choice after ICAS since it not only enables visualization of the patency of the stent lumen but also is minimally invasive and provides additional information about all brain arteries and the brain parenchyma.

]. In addition, ia-DSA is not offered on an outpatient basis at every medical center so patients have to be admitted for at least one night, significantly increasing the treatment costs. Furthermore, patient compliance with follow-up examinations may be a problem because the ia-DSA procedure is not very comfortable.

. The ACT datasets were further processed to multiplanar reconstructed (MPR) slices with the thin-slice and thick-slice maximum intensity projection (MIP) technique parallel and perpendicular to the stent-supplied section of the vessel, respectively. The contrast medium used in the follow-up ACT examination was Imeron 350 (Bracco ALTANA Pharma, Konstanz, Germany). The contrast medium was injected to a volume of 100 ml into a cubital vein at a flow rate of 5 ml/s, and the start delay for rotational acquisition was 20 s. The patient was asked to close his or her eyes and to breathe calmly during the examination.

]. Additionally, not every center is able to perform ia-DSA on an outpatient basis. The risk may be less with ia-ACT if the injection is performed in the aortic arch. However, this is still an invasive procedure.

Possible drawbacks of the iv-ACT technique first include movement artifacts. The patient has to lie nearly motionless for about 20 seconds, which requires a high level of compliance and is not always feasible in patients suffering from cerebrovascular disease.

]. Our second patient demonstrates that the lumen of these stents can be visualized as well. This issue is not unimportant because until recently dedicated intracranial stents were not available. Therefore, the majority of stents implanted into intracranial vessels are still coronary stents.
Iv-ACT is a promising new technique for minimally invasive follow-up after intracranial stenting. Other possible applications can be envisaged, such as diagnostic and follow-up imaging before and after endovascular treatment of intracranial aneurysms or arteriovenous malformations.
