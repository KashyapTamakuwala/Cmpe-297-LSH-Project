Medicinal plants used to treat hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic conditions are of considerable interest to ethno-botanical community as they are recognized 
				to contain valuable medicinal properties in different parts of the plant. The active principles of many plant species with desired properties are isolated 
				to cure ailments such as diabetes type-1 and type-2, respectively. Here, we describe DiaMedBase, a database containing information of medicinal plants for 
				diabetes.

] Hence, we created 
			DiaMedBase, a diabetes literature database of medicinal plants with abstract, plant parts, objective and a ‘disease link’ to diseases other 
			than diabetes for each medicinal plant.

. However, the list is not complete. They are provided alphabetically and the records are organized 
			to simplify the task of finding relevant data for any plant. The database can be accessed alphabetically using genus name for information on specific plants.

Features of DiaMedBase

. Of the collected data, 36% whole plant, 
             26% leaves, 12% seeds, 10% roots, and 4% fruits. The characteristic feature of DiaMedBase is ‘Disease Link’, provided in each record displays 
             the list of diseases other than diabetes as a pop-up window indicating the importance of medicinal values of plants.


Utility
DiaMedBase emphasizes the importance of hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic properties possessed by medicinal plants. The database finds utility to the scientific 
			community for a quick review on the number of plants and plant parts for diabetes medicinal plant research.

Future development
Continuous updates shall be released to include other plants of medicinal value periodically. The present access method shall be upgraded to browse records 
			on the studied plant parts. We plan to develop provisions to search the database to identify plants of interest using keywords.
