) from 660 to 611 nm, and to an increase of fluorescence intensity. Time-resolved fluorescence and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) measurements showed that Nile red detected large aggregates with hydrodynamic radii around 130 nm. By steady-state fluorescence measurements, it was possible to detect 1 nM of denatured and aggregated β-galactosidase in solution. The comparison with size exclusion chromatography (SEC) showed that native β-galactosidase and small aggregates thereof had no substantial effect on the fluorescence of Nile red. Large aggregates were not detected by SEC, because they were excluded from the column. The results with β-galactosidase demonstrate the potential of Nile red for developing complementary analytical methods that overcome the size limitations of SEC, and can detect the formation of large protein aggregates at early stages.

In this study, steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy experiments with Nile red are used for the sensitive detection of large β-galactosidase aggregates, present in solution at concentrations in the low nanomolar range. Denaturation and aggregation of native protein is induced by incubating aqueous solutions below and above the experimentally determined unfolding temperature of 57.4°C. The presence of aggregates in heat-treated solutions is confirmed by light scattering. Time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) are used for analyzing the size of the aggregates detected by Nile red. The results obtained with Nile red are compared with results from SEC analysis.

 was prepared with reverse osmosis water, and rendered isotonic by the addition of NaCl. Upon preparation, buffer solution was filtered through a 0.2 μm cellulose acetate filter (Schleicher and Schuell, Dassel, Germany), and stored at 4°C for at most 4 weeks. 0.2 μm HPLC filters were obtained from Alltech (Deerfield, IL). Nile red (9-diethylamino-5H-benzo[α]phenoxazine-5-one) was obtained from Fluka. A stock solution containing 0.25 mM Nile red was prepared with water-free dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and stored at −20°C.

]. Reproducibly, a protein concentration close to 0.10 μM was found after filtration.
For incubation at elevated temperatures, 1 ml aliquots of β-galactosidase solution containing 0.10 μM protein were filled into 1.5 ml polypropylene Eppendorf tubes. They were heated for a defined period of time without shaking using an Eppendorf Thermomixer (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany), and then cooled at room temperature.


Steady-state fluorescence measurements
Instrument and measurement settings
Steady-state fluorescence measurements were performed with a Fluorolog FL3-21 spectrofluorometer (Jobin Yvon – Horiba, Edison, NJ), equipped with a short-arc xenon lamp. The slit openings of the excitation and emission monochromators were set to a bandwidth of 3 nm. The integration time was 0.05 s, and the signals were corrected for lamp intensity fluctuations by a simultaneously recorded reference signal. Each sample was measured 3–5 times, and the average spectrum was calculated. The sample temperature was controlled by a water bath with a temperature sensor connected to the sample holder. Samples were measured in quartz cuvettes (Hellma GmbH, Muellheim, Germany).

Intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence
Measurements of intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of β-galactosidase were performed by exciting 0.10 μM protein solutions at 298 nm and scanning emission between 310 and 450 nm. To establish a protein denaturation curve, the sample temperature was increased from 25 to 70°C in one degree steps. At every temperature, the sample was equilibrated for 5 min and then measured.

Nile red fluorescence

]. Nile red fluorescence was measured by exciting at 550 nm and scanning emission between 565 and 750 nm. All measurements were performed at 25°C. Fluorescence spectra were measured immediately after addition of Nile red. However, Nile red emission in water remained unchanged for at least 25 min upon sample preparation.

Measurements were performed at 25°C, and consisted of repeated 10 s sequences of measuring parallel and perpendicularly polarized fluorescence emission until a maximum peak content of at least 50,000 counts in the data files was reached. Samples of β-galactosidase solution without Nile red were measured for background correction. To minimize background luminescence, all solutions, including buffer, were prepared with fluorescence spectroscopy grade water (Fluka, Buchs, Switzerland). For the performance of a deconvolution procedure in data analysis, the dynamic instrumental response of the experimental setup was recorded using the fast and single-exponential fluorescence decay of the reference compound erythrosine B in water.

Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy measurements
Instrument and measurement settings
Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy measurements were performed with a system composed of a krypton-argon laser and an MRC1024 confocal laser-scanning microscope (Biorad, Hercules, CA), a TE300D inverted microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) with a water immersion objective lens (Plan Apo 60×, NA 1.2, collar rim correction, Nikon), and ALV-5000/E avalanche photodiode detectors (ALV GmbH, Langen, Germany). The 568 nm line of the krypton-argon laser was used for excitation of Nile red samples. Fluorescence emission above 585 nm was detected.
Samples were prepared by mixing heated 0.10 μM β-galactosidase solution, non-heated 0.10 μM β-galactosidase solution or phosphate buffer with diluted Nile red stock solution in polypropylene Eppendorf tubes. Heated β-galactosidase solution was mixed with Nile red in the same tubes that were used for heating. The final concentration of Nile red in the samples was 18.75 nM. One hundred μl sample was transferred into a well of a 96 glass bottom well plate (Bio-one, Greiner, Frickenhausen, Germany). For measurements, the focal volume was positioned 100 μm above the bottom of the well. Raw data, i.e. fluctuations of fluorescence intensity with time, were collected during 30 s. The laser power was minimized to prevent photobleaching during this period. Every sample was measured ten times, and ten experimental autocorrelation functions were subsequently obtained from the raw data.

Light scattering
Detection of β-galactosidase aggregates in solution was done with static light scattering measurements using a fluorometer (Fluorolog FL3-21, Jobin Yvon–Horiba, Edison, NJ). The excitation and emission wavelengths were set to 400 nm, and measurements were performed at 25°C.

The emission of Nile red in the presence of non-heated protein was almost identical to the dye’s emission in buffer. This indicates that the surface area of native β-galactosidase is highly polar, and that possible apolar sites are not accessible to Nile red. Storage of unheated β-galactosidase solutions containing Nile red for up to 25 min at room temperature did not lead to a change of the dyes fluorescence, showing that the presence of Nile red does not lead to a change of β-galactosidase surface hydrophobicity over time.

The fluorescence of Nile red did not depend on the time that protein solutions were kept at room temperature upon heating at 49°C (not shown), which indicates that irreversibly denatured β-galactosidase species were detected.

With all samples, anisotropy decreased at short times, then increased again, and finally remained at an almost constant value. The practically constant value of anisotropy at long times indicated rotational diffusion that was too slow to be detected by Nile red fluorescence. Therefore, although indicating that Nile red was in fact bound to large particles such as aggregates of β-galactosidase, it was not possible to estimate the size of these particles by time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy.

The former is full of high-intensity peaks that were caused by large aggregates with bound Nile red crossing the focal volume. The latter contains only one high-intensity peak, representing a single large aggregate crossing the focal volume. As a consequence of the low aggregate concentration in samples heated at 49°C, only 3 out of 100 measurements contained high-intensity peaks. In spite of their rare occurrence, these peaks were not artifacts. No high-intensity peaks were detected in a total of 150 control experiments with Nile red in buffer and in non-heated β-galactosidase solution.

), which means that Nile red was equally sensitive to aggregates formed by heating at 49 and 62°C.


Conclusions
Using the model protein β-galactosidase, it was shown that the presence small amounts of large, denatured protein aggregates in solution can be detected by Nile red fluorescence. Aggregates detected by Nile red had hydrodynamic radii around 130 nm with a broad size distribution. Native protein and small aggregates thereof had no substantial effect on Nile red fluorescence intensity. By steady-state fluorescence measurements, it was possible to detect 1 nM denatured and highly aggregated β-galactosidase in solution.
The spectroscopic detection of protein aggregates by Nile red is potentially useful for formulation screening or quality control of protein pharmaceutics. The presence of even minute fractions of aggregates in protein formulations needs to be avoided, because this can cause immune reactions in patients. Since large aggregates are particularly potent for breaking immune tolerance, their analytical detection is very important. SEC, which is the standard method for studying protein aggregation, is not reliable for detecting large aggregates, because they may be excluded from the separation column. In this work we showed that an analytical detection method with Nile red is a possible approach to overcome this shortcoming of SEC. After establishing the method with time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy and FCS, as was done for β-galactosidase, steady-state fluorescence measurements, which can be performed in most labs, may enable an experimentally simple and sensitive detection of large protein aggregates.
