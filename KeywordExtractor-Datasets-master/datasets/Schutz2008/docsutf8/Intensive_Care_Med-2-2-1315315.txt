Objective
To develop a model to assess severity of illness and predict vital status at hospital discharge based on ICU admission data.

Design
Prospective multicentre, multinational cohort study.

Patients and setting
A total of 16,784 patients consecutively admitted to 303 intensive care units from 14 October to 15 December 2002.

Measurements and results
 p
 p
=0.16). Customised equations for major areas of the world were computed and demonstrate a good overall goodness-of-fit.

Conclusions
The SAPS 3 admission score is able to predict vital status at hospital discharge with use of data recorded at ICU admission. Furthermore, SAPS 3 conceptually dissociates evaluation of the individual patient from evaluation of the ICU and thus allows them to be assessed at their respective reference levels.

]. To overcome this problem, we chose to adopt a new strategy for the development of the SAPS 3 score and to apply statistical modelling techniques that control for the clustering of patients within ICUs instead of assuming the independence of observations. Conceptually, the SAPS 3 admission core comprises the following parts:
 SAPS 3 ADMISSION SCORE
Box I:
 What we know about the patient characteristics before ICU admission: age, previous health status, co-morbidities, location before ICU admission, length of stay in the hospital before ICU admission, and use of major therapeutic options before ICU admission.

Box II:
 What we know about the circumstances of ICU admission: reason(s) for ICU admission, anatomic site of surgery (if applicable), planned or unplanned ICU admission, surgical status and infection at ICU admission.

Box III:
 What we know about the presence and degree of physiologic derangement at ICU admission (within 1 h before or after admission).


 SAPS 3 PROBABILITY OF DEATH
 during a certain period of time (in the case of the main model, the probability of death at hospital discharge).
 data available at ICU admission or shortly thereafter
. This model will be completely open and available free of any direct or indirect charges to the scientific community.

Methods and statistical analysis
Primary variable selection

] were applied to check the cutoffs.
Missing values were coded as the reference or “normal” category for each variable. When dual data collection was used—maximum and minimum values recorded during a certain time period—missing maximum values of a variable were replaced by the minimum, if documented, and vice versa. Some regression imputations were performed if noticeable correlations to available values could be exploited. For a detailed description of data collection and handling, see Part 1 of this report.
Selection of variables was done according to their association with hospital mortality, together with expert knowledge and definitions used in other severity of illness scoring systems. The objective of using this combination of techniques rather than regression-based criteria alone was to reach a compromise between over-sophistication of the model and knowledge from sources beyond the sample with its specific case mix and ICU characteristics.

Cross validation
11
]. In a second approach, partitioning was based on ICUs and not on patients. It was thus possible to run the model-building procedure five times in each of the two approaches, each time taking four parts of the sample as a development set and the remaining one as the validation set. This allowed to estimate the variability of prediction resulting from the construction process of the prognostic score. A further check of the stability of the predictions was made by partitioning the sample according to major patient characteristics, such as surgical status and infection status.

Reducing model complexity
 p
12
]. At this stage we also evaluated if interactions among these predictors would influence results. Interactions, however, did not make a valuable contribution for the prediction.
Significant predictors (n=70) were in a second step entered into a logistic regression model. The criterion for a predictor to enter the model was homogeneity across the five model-building processes: in principle, predictors should enter the model in all five development sets, but depending on the frequency of the predictor in the samples, the magnitude of the effect, and medical reasoning, some predictors were included if they appeared in the model in at least three subsamples. An example is the presence of Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS): it was selected as a comorbidity in only 81 patients (0.48%), but the mortality—without controlling for other variables—in these patients was 42%. By taking all the above steps to identify the set of predictors, although deliberately not using any formal numeric criterion, we reduced the complexity of the model to minimize the amount of overfitting: This process resulted in 61 item classes (representing 20 variables) remaining in the final model.
Using the parameter estimates from the logistic regression as starting values, a multilevel model was applied in the next step, using patient characteristics as fixed effects and ICUs as a random effect. Estimates were again calculated for the five development sets (for both, patient and ICU -based development subsamples).
At this stage it was checked if rounding of coefficients (which allows for an easier manual computation of the score) would influence results, which was found not to be the case. Consequently, this was the approach chosen for the final construction of the SAPS 3 admission score sheet.
The stability of the processes of variable selection and reducing complexity was further checked by bootstraping with replacement the total sample 100 times, both at patient level and at ICU level.

Predicting hospital mortality
 g
) scores were used to predict hospital mortality. Conventional logistic regression was used in the evaluation of this step because of convergence problems for the corresponding multilevel model in a few subsamples. The best shrinkage model then was selected (excluding the trivial model with the SAPS 3 score as the single predictor) by checking which of the terms in the model contributed best to the prediction and was moreover stable over the respective validation sets and specific subsamples. This procedure was applied on both, patient and ICU -based subsamples.
After finishing these steps of cross-validation, the final estimates for the selected predictors of the SAPS 3 score as well as the selected shrinkage procedure were then calculated from the total sample of patients.
 g
) admission scores computed as described above to the vital status at hospital discharge. This process allows both the intercept and the slope of the curve relating the SAPS 3 admission score to change across different regions. The goodness-of-fit of these equations was evaluated by means of the same methodology used for the global sample.

Five variables for evaluating Box I: age, co-morbidities, use of vasoactive drugs before ICU admission, intrahospital location before ICU admission, and length of stay in the hospital before ICU admission;

Five variables for evaluating Box II: reason(s) for ICU admission, planned/unplanned ICU admission, surgical status at ICU admission, anatomic site of surgery, and presence of infection at ICU admission and place acquired;

Ten variables for evaluating Box III: lowest estimated Glasgow coma scale, highest heart rate, lowest systolic blood pressure, highest bilirubine, highest body temperature, highest creatinine, highest leukocytes, lowest platelets, lowest hydrogen ion concentration (pH), and ventilatory support and oxygenation.

Third, since computation of predicted mortality is based on a reference database, the user should be able to choose between them, i.e., a global database, which provides a broader comparison at the potential cost of less relevance to local conditions, and a regional database, which provides a better comparison with ICUs in geographic proximity but at the cost of losing comparability with ICUs in other parts of the world. A third possibility could be added—a country-representative database—but such a database would raise the problem of whether the ICUs selected were representative of a certain country.

]. The results of the SAPS 3 study showing that different O/E ratios were observed in different regions of the world should be explored further, since, apart from regional differences in case mix (not taken into account by the model), they can also be related to regional variations in structures and organization of acute medical care, to different lifestyles (e.g., prevalence of obesity, or alcohol and tobacco use) and/or—though less likely—to genetic differences among populations.

Further studies should be done of factors occurring after ICU admission that influence risk-adjusted mortality. We should keep however in mind that this approach comes with one potential pitfall: a possible decrease in the amount of data available for the computation of the model; also, the shorter time period for data collection can eventually increase the likelihood of missing physiological data and the reliance on the assumption that missing physiological data are normal. This effect should be small, considering the widespread availability of monitoring and point-of-case analysers.

The SAPS 3 system was developed to be used free of charge by the scientific community; no proprietary information regarding the scientific content is retained. All the coefficients needed for the computation of outcome probabilities are available in the published material. The SAPS 3 can even be computed manually, using a simple scoresheet, although it was designed to be integrated into computerised data acquisition and storage systems that allow the automatic check of the quality of the registered data.

 patient-dependent problems
 by expanding the reference database and making it more representative of reality, in order to include the maximum possible range of variations for patient-centred variables and resulting patient-centred outcomes. This approach was complemented by the development of specific customised equations for major areas of the world, allowing ICUs to choose a reference line for outcome prediction—the global database or the regional database for their own area.
Users of these models should keep in mind that benchmarking is a process of comparing an ICU with a reference population. The appropriate choice of reference population is difficult, and we cannot simply change it because the observed-to-predicted mortality rate is not the one we want. For this reason, the choice should depend on the objective of the benchmark: more precise estimation will need local or regional equations, developed from a more homogeneous case mix. A generalisable estimation will, on the other hand, need more global equations developed from a more representative case mix.
Last but not least, we have successfully addressed some of the problems of prognostic model development, especially those related to the underlying statistical assumptions for the use of specific methods for selection and weighting of variables and the conceptual development of outcome prediction models. In the future, multi-level modelling with varying slopes (and not just random intercepts) might be able to give a better answer to researchers but for the moment they would make the models to complex to be managed outside a research environment.
