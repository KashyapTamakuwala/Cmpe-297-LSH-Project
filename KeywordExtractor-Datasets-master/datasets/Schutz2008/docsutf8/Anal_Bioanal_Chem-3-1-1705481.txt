Analytical methods for the analysis of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) are widely available and are the result of a vast amount of environmental analytical method development and research on persistent organic pollutants (POPs) over the past 30–40 years. This review summarizes procedures and examines new approaches for extraction, isolation, identification and quantification of individual congeners/isomers of the PCBs and OCPs. Critical to the successful application of this methodology is the collection, preparation, and storage of samples, as well as specific quality control and reporting criteria, and therefore these are also discussed. With the signing of the Stockholm convention on POPs and the development of global monitoring programs, there is an increased need for laboratories in developing countries to determine PCBs and OCPs. Thus, while this review attempts to summarize the current best practices for analysis of PCBs and OCPs, a major focus is the need for low-cost methods that can be easily implemented in developing countries. A “performance based” process is described whereby individual laboratories can adapt methods best suited to their situations. Access to modern capillary gas chromatography (GC) equipment with either electron capture or low-resolution mass spectrometry (MS) detection to separate and quantify OCP/PCBs is essential. However, screening of samples, especially in areas of known use of OCPs or PCBs, could be accomplished with bioanalytical methods such as specific commercially available enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assays and thus this topic is also reviewed. New analytical techniques such two-dimensional GC (2D-GC) and “fast GC” using GC–ECD may be well-suited for broader use in routine PCB/OCP analysis in the near future given their relatively low costs and ability to provide high-resolution separations of PCB/OCPs. Procedures with low environmental impact (SPME, microscale, low solvent use, etc.) are increasingly being used and may be particularly suited to developing countries.

Introduction
Scope of the review
1
]. For countries where PCBs and OCPs are still in use or loosely regulated, the NIPs will eventually lead to the phase-out of OCPs for agricultural use and reduced use for disease vector control. However, many countries will be faced with the legacy of past use of these persistent chemicals. Residues in soils, sediments and biota will pose a risk for wildlife and human consumers. The problems of destroying existing stockpiles, especially of OCPs and PCBs in electrical equipment, as well as preventing migration of contaminants from storage areas, will need to be solved. There is a need to monitor levels and trends now and into the future in order to assess compliance with the POPs Convention within each country as well as on a regional and global basis.
Methodology is available for PCBs and OCPs as a result of a vast amount of environmental analytical chemistry research and development over the past 30 to 40 years. However, the establishment of an analytical laboratory and the application of this methodology at currently acceptable international standards is a relatively expensive undertaking. Furthermore, the current trend to use isotope-labeled analytical standards and high-resolution mass spectrometry for routine POPs analysis is particularly expensive. These costs limit participation of scientists in developing countries and this is clear from the relative lack of publications and information on POPs from countries in Africa, south Asia and South/Central America. Thus, this review will summarize the best practices in developed countries and new advances in PCB/OCP analysis, while bearing in mind the need for low-cost methods easily implemented in developing countries.

Furthermore, in North America, most datasets for toxaphene are still based on quantification with technical toxaphene, which yields a single value and no congener-specific information. Capacity for determining toxaphene outside of the USA, Canada and western Europe is very limited judging from the relatively large number of measurements from these countries and the dearth of measurements elsewhere.

These authors recommended that multilevel calibration at 4–6 levels should be used to define the response profile, that calibration solutions should be checked against independent solutions, either from another reliable laboratory or by preparing duplicate solutions, and that calibrants should be ampouled (in sealed glass vials) for long-term storage. They noted that refrigerator storage can loosen the caps on screw-top vials. Thus, storage of calibrant solutions in this manner should only be temporary.

]. The advantages of GPC are that it is nondestructive and that columns can be reused. A disadvantage is a requirement for large volumes of purified solvent (low-pressure or gravity systems) or expensive columns (HPLC). Automated GPC units are commercially available and allow for unsupervised elution of 12–24 samples. Due to required rinses of the unit sample lines, a portion of the sample is lost and must be accounted for when calculating final analyte concentrations. GPC eluates generally require an adsorption column fractionation step on silica or Florisil to remove remaining low molecular weight lipids, waxes and pigments that are not completely separated from the PCB/OCPs.

Preparation for GC analysis
Following fractionation on silica or Florisil, final extracts are prepared in GC vials for analysis. Addition of an internal standard to check solvent volume is recommended at this stage. Careful evaporation is required at this step, and only high-purity compressed gas (usually nitrogen) should be used. This can be done using a stream of regulated gas via a disposable glass pipet and heating block or via multineedle devices (e.g., “N-Evap”).

], particularly with the advent of bench-top instruments. Current GC–low-resolution (quadrupole) mass spectrometry (LRMS) instrumentation is capable of determining most PCB/OCPs at low pg concentrations using electron ionization (EI) in selected ion mode. Electron capture negative ion ionization (ECNI) is capable of detection of low femtogram amounts of highly chlorinated OCPs such as chlordane and toxaphene congeners. In this mode, a reagent gas, usually methane, is introduced into the ion source and negative ions are monitored. The ECNI mode also has a more limited linear range than the EI mode, is more difficult to operate routinely due to greater sensitivity to temperature variations, and needs more frequent cleaning due to the reaction of the reagent gas with surfaces in the ion source.

As a routine measure, spiking surrogate recovery standards into each sample provides useful information on losses of analyte from the extraction step onwards. However, no single PCB or OCP can be representative of all of the organochlorines being determined, and thus recovery correction should be performed with caution. Isotopically labeled surrogates are ideal for analyses of PCBs and OCPs that are being performed by LRMS and HRMS, and isotope dilution techniques correct for the recoveries of these surrogates.

In the context of implementation of the Stockholm POPs Convention, global comparability is the goal and thus successful participation in international programs should be a requirement of any participating lab. The challenge for future POPs monitoring, especially in developing countries, will be to assess the quality of data and to provide guidance for best laboratory practices.

Emerging issues in analytical methods and future directions

]. Although PCB/OCP analysis is a mature area within environmental analytical chemistry, with basic methods that have remained unchanged for the past 20 years, there have been many new technologies that have been gradually adopted and undoubtedly more will emerge in the future. Some emerging procedures with low environmental impact (SPME, microscale glassware, low solvent use, etc.) may be particularly suited for developing countries where analytical budgets are small and product delivery times are lengthy. Thus, strategies must be considered that will allow improved techniques to be adopted by such labs.

Conclusions
6
].
The analytical methodologies discussed here refer to an “analytical system” encompassing information on the collection and storage of samples, the procedures used to extract, isolate, concentrate, separate, identify, and quantify POPs residues in samples, as well as specific quality control and reporting criteria. All aspects of this system must be in operation for POPs to be analyzed and reported.
The chemical analytical methodology for the determination of PCBs and OCPs is a mature area within environmental analytical chemistry as a result of research and development over the past 30–40 years. Basic steps in the quantification of OCPs and PCB congeners have hardly changed in the past 20 years. Analytical methods for the determination of OCP/PCBs in foods, soils, sediments, fish, birds, mammals (including human milk and blood) are available and could be implemented at relatively low cost in developing countries. However, access to modern capillary GC equipment with either electron capture or mass spectrometry (MS) detection to separate and quantify PCBs/OCPs is required in order to conduct the analysis and to take part in regional and international intercomparsons.
In general, ELISAs are very useful tools for the rapid assessment of PCB/OCPs contamination, especially in areas of former heavy use. They are particularly well-suited to laboratories in developing countries which may have access to spectrophotometric equipment but not to GC instrumentation.
Existing analytical methods for PCB/OCPs can determine over 100 individual components at low ng/g concentrations in many environmental media using high-resolution capillary GC–ECD. However, the number of certified values for OCP/PCB congeners in certified reference materials is more limited (approximately 23 PCB congeners and 15 OCPs in NIST 1588a cod liver). At a minimum, the OCP/PCBs for which there are certified values in readily available CRMs should be determined (approximately 38). With this number of analytes, the information would be useful for both regulatory actions as well as for source identification using multivariate analysis or other “fingerprinting” methods.
Interlab comparisons of POPs analysis over the past ten years have shown that availability of accurate analytical standards is a fundamental requirement of an analytical program designed to quantify trace organic contaminants such as POPs. Agencies such as GEF and UNEP Chemicals should give top priority to ensuring that certified analytical standards are available to all labs on a continuing basis.
Quality assurance programs are critically important for demonstrating the performance of analytical methods for POPs within a lab and between labs. QA requirements for PCBs/OCP analysis are well known and include the use of certified reference materials, field and laboratory blanks, the use of quality control charts to monitor long-term lab performance, participation in interlaboratory studies, and the use of guidelines for sampling and analysis.
Determination of PCBs/OCPs requires the analysis of blank samples because of the ubiquitous nature of these contaminants. If blanks are significant (for example, averaging greater than 10% of the average level of total PCBs), then blank correction should be carried out.
As a routine measure, spiking surrogate recovery standards into each sample provides useful information on losses of analyte from the extraction step onwards. However, no single PCB or OCP can be representative of all the organochlorines being determined, and thus recovery correction should be performed with caution. Isotopically labeled surrogates are ideal for the quantification of PCBs and many OCPs via LRMS and HRMS; the application of isotope dilution techniques can correct for the recoveries of these surrogates.
Detection limits depend not only on the analytical method used but also on the sample size and QA considerations, e.g., on information available from blank or control samples and recovery studies. Detection limits should be calculated as described by US EPA or by IUPAC/ISO methodology. Comparison of detection limits for widely used instrumentation for POPs with action limits for POPs in food and tissue residue guidelines suggests that current GC–ECD and GC-MS analytical methodology for PCB/OCPs can meet and exceed these limits, in some cases by orders of magnitude.
Some emerging new analytical techniques, such 2D-GC and “fast GC” using GC–ECD, may be well-suited for use in developing countries in the near future given their relatively low cost and their ability to provide high-resolution separations of OCP/PCBs. Procedures with low environmental impacts (microscale, low solvent use, etc.) may be particularly well-suited to developing countries where analytical budgets are small and product delivery times are lengthy. Thus, strategies must be considered that will allow improved techniques to be adopted by such labs.
