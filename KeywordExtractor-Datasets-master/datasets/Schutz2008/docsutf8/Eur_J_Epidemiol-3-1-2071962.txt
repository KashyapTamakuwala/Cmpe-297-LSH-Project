] the intake of potassium was inversely related to risk of stroke. Data on dietary potassium in relation to coronary and all-cause mortality in humans are scanty. We examined the relationship of sodium and potassium intake with cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality in the older cohort of the population-based Rotterdam Study.

Methods
The Rotterdam Study
22
]. The Medical Ethics Committee of the Erasmus Medical Centre Rotterdam approved the study, and written informed consent was obtained from all participants. From August 1990 until June 1993, a trained research assistant collected data on health, medication use, lifestyle, and risk indicators for chronic diseases during a home interview. Subjects were subsequently invited at the study centre for clinical examination and assessment of diet.

Assessment of diet
23
24
]. No information on salt use was obtained and therefore data on dietary sodium were considered unreliable for this analysis.

Clinical examination

Assessment of sodium and potassium excretion
®
 250 (formerly Ektachem 250) Chemistry System (Johnson & Johnson, Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics Inc., Rochester, New York). Determination of electrolytes and creatinine were based on potentiometry and enzymatic conversion, respectively. Urinary sodium and potassium concentrations (mmol/l) were standardized to 24-h values using recorded collection times and urinary volumes (ml). In addition, urinary sodium/potassium ratio was computed.

Follow-up procedures
International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision
26
]. Coded events were reviewed by a medical expert in the field, whose judgment was considered definite in case of discrepancies.
Myocardial infarction comprised ICD-10 code I21 and stroke comprised ICD-10 codes I60-I67. Both fatal and non-fatal incident events were recorded. For the present study, only first events were considered. Events followed by death within 28 days were classified as fatal. CVD mortality comprised fatal myocardial infarction, fatal stroke, sudden cardiac death and other forms of fatal CVD (ICD-10 codes I20-I25, I46, I49, I50, I60-I67, I70-I74, and R96).

Data analysis
Pearson correlations were computed to examine inter-relationships between urinary and dietary measures of electrolyte intake and associations with total energy intake.

]. We used the method according to Barlow in which the random cohort is weighted by the inverse of the sampling fraction from the source population. Members of the random cohort are included from baseline until failure or censoring, whereas cases outside the cohort are included at the time of their event. For the Cox models we used Proc MI and Proc MIanalyze, in conjunction with Proc Phreg (SAS 8.2).

), smoking status (current, past, or never), diabetes mellitus (yes/no), use of diuretics (yes/no), and highest completed education (three categories). In a third analysis (model 3), dietary confounders were additionally adjusted for, i.e. daily intake of total energy (kJ), alcohol (g), calcium (g), and saturated fat (g). In the analysis for urinary sodium we additionally included urinary potassium in this model, and vice versa.

), using model 3.
Also in the sub-cohort free of CVD and hypertension, the distribution of 24-h urinary sodium excretion was divided into quartiles to be able to examine the relationship with all-cause mortality at extreme intakes. Quartiles of urinary sodium (cut-off levels: 66, 105 and 151 mmol/24 h) were entered categorically into the fully adjusted model (model 3), using the lower quartile as the reference.

Discussion
In an unselected population of older Dutch subjects we found no consistent association of urinary sodium and potassium with CVD events or mortality. Dietary potassium estimated by food frequency questionnaire, however, was associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality. Urinary sodium/potassium ratio was positively associated with mortality risk, but only in overweight subjects without CVD and hypertension at baseline.

31
]. In that study, on a randomly selected day, both 24-h and nocturnal sodium excretion estimated the daily intake reasonably well. Nevertheless, it is likely that misclassification has attenuated the relationships with CVD events and mortality in our study. Incomplete urine collection was partly adjusted for by adding urinary creatinine excretion to the multivariate models. In addition, we examined the urinary sodium/potassium ratio, which is less influenced by incomplete urine collection. To exclude bias due to dietary changes, we repeated all analyses in a subgroup without CVD or hypertension at baseline.

], although this may be confined to specific subgroups with overweight, hypertension or high salt intake. In overweight subjects, we did find a positive relationship between urinary sodium/potassium ratio and overall mortality (19% increase in risk per unit change in sodium/potassium ratio).
19
21

]. Data on potassium intake in relation to mortality, however, are sparse and more prospective population-based studies are needed to draw conclusions. Preferably, the effect of dietary potassium on CVD should be examined in a randomized trial.

]. From this and other epidemiological studies we conclude that effect of dietary salt on clinical cardiovascular endpoints and overall mortality within the range of intake commonly observed in Western countries has not yet been established. More research is needed to settle the discussion regarding this major public health issue.
