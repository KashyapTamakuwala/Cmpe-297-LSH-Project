 < 0.0001), a finding confirmed by western blot on a subset of 20 tissue pairs. Moreover, the tumor-to-normal ratio of MDM4 levels for each individual was significantly lower in late tumor stages, suggesting a specific downregulation of MDM4 expression with tumor progression. In comparison, MDM2 messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein levels were frequently upregulated with no correlation with MDM4 levels. Lastly, we frequently detected overexpression of MDM4-S mRNA and presence of the aberrant form, MDM4-211 in this tumor group. These findings indicate that MDM4 alterations are a frequent event in PTC. It is worthy to note that the significant downregulation of full-length MDM4 in PTC reveals a novel status of this factor in human cancer that counsels careful evaluation of its role in human tumorigenesis and of its potential as therapeutic target.

]. This form derives from an aberrant splicing and produces a protein containing essentially the RING finger COOH-terminus, where the MDM2 binding site resides. As a consequence, this variant is able to stabilize MDM2 protein levels, thus contributing to inactivation of p53. These data, while underlying the complexity of MDM4 expression in human tumors, strongly encourage studies on the comparative analysis of this protein and its derivative forms in human cancer.

]. However, the overall frequency of MDM2 overexpression is only about 30%, suggesting the existence of other pathways of p53 inactivation.
The aim of our study has been to analyze papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTC), the most frequent thyroid cancer, for the presence of MDM4 and its derivative forms to investigate alterations of these proteins in this tumor histotype and correlate them with histopathological features. In addition, we have analyzed MDM2 levels to assess the potential relationship between alterations of the two MDM family members. Our data have revealed the aberrant presence of variants MDM4-S and MDM4-211 messenger RNA (mRNA) in PTC as well as lack of correlation between MDM4 and MDM2 mRNA levels. Of note, levels of MDM4 mRNA were significantly downregulated in tumor samples in comparison to normal counterparts, and such downregulation appears significantly associated with tumor stage.

Materials and methods
Tissue samples and patients
Fifty-seven papillary thyroid carcinomas and 57 matched normal thyroid tissue samples from the contra-lateral lobe (CTRL) of 57 patients were studied. In addition, to confirm statistical analyses, 26 papillary thyroid carcinomas and three normal thyroid tissues from independent individuals were analyzed. All specimens were obtained from patients undergoing surgery at the University of Perugia from 1997 to 2007. Before the surgical procedure, all patients signed informed consent forms for collection of fresh thyroid samples for genetic studies. All specimens were sampled from the primary tumor at the time of surgery, snap frozen, and stored at −80°C until use. Tumors containing at least 70% of tumor cells based on the hematoxylin–eosin staining were selected. All normal thyroid tissue from the contra-lateral lobe were histopathologically analyzed for the presence of tumor. Available medical records of the patients were consulted to gain information about the clinical features of the disease and, when possible, the tumor stage was defined according to the sixth edition of the “American Joint Committee on Cancer” Cancer Staging Manual (American Joint Committee on Cancer 2002) based on pathological tumor–node–metastasis parameters and distinguishing patients in two groups: (1) patient age < 45 years (stage I and II), (2) patient age ≥ 45 years (stage I, II, III, IV).
The total of 83 papillary thyroid carcinomas included 55 of the classic variant, 20 of the follicular variant, five of other variants (tall cell, solid, diffuse sclerosing), and three showing the coexistence of PTC histology with areas of dedifferentiation. The mean period of follow-up was 45.8 ± 30.4 months.

Purified PCR products were sequenced in both directions with the use of the BigDye terminator Cycle sequencing Kit (version 1.1, Applied Biosystems) and an ABI Genetic Analyzer (Model 3130, Applied Biosystems). Sequence data were analyzed by means of SeqScape software (version 2.1, Applied Biosystems) followed by manual review.

]. Briefly, samples were lysed in radio-immunoprecipitation assay buffer (50 mM Tris–Cl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% Na desoxicholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) supplemented with a cocktail of protease inhibitors (Boehringer). Whole lysates were boiled in SDS Laemnli sample buffer, resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on precast 10% gels (Invitrogen) and subsequently transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Millipore). After protein transfer, membranes were blocked for 30 min with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween-20 and 5% nonfat dry milk and incubated with specific antibodies. The following primary antibodies were used: rabbit anti-MDM4 polyclonal antibody R1 (raised against full-length MDM4 protein) and (Bethyl Laboratories) mouse anti-MDM2 monoclonal antibody 2A10 and monoclonal antibody Ab-1 (oncogene), mouse anti-α-tubulin monoclonal antibody DM-1A (Sigma), and mouse α-actin monoclonal antibody AC-40 (Sigma). MDM4 was probed with both Bethyl and R1 antibodies, giving similar results although, in comparison, the polyclonal antibody R1 was more sensitive. The homemade R1 antibody has been raised using the entire MDM4 protein. Experiments of epitope mapping by using MDM4-deletion mutants have shown that R1 does not recognize the NH2-terminus of MDM4. It is therefore unable to recognize the MDM4-S form.

Statistical analysis

 < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Intraindividual variation was calculated by utilizing the T-to-N ratio that derives from the ratio of corrected tumor (mRNA or protein) levels to corrected normal tissue levels of MDM4 and MDM2.

]. However, lack of detection of any of the most frequent mutation of TP53 gene in this PTC group does not support this hypothesis, at least in this type of cancer. Similarly, in the prestate tumor study TP53 was found to be wild type by sequencing (A. Farsetti, personal communication).

]. Whether these mechanisms occur in PTC remain to be elucidated.

]. Further, the association between MDM4 levels and tumor multifocality is of particular clinical relevance. Indeed, the possibility of early diagnosis of tumor multifocality might allow discrimination between partial or total thyroid gland ablation. The extension of this type of analysis to a broader set of samples, including benign lesions, should help to confirm these findings and to investigate potential applications of this molecule in clinical practice.

) does not allow to confirm this association. For MDM4-211, this is the first frequency report in a large group of tumor samples and indicates that its presence is appreciable in PTC (18%). Interestingly, these MDM4 variants forms show in vitro an even stronger inhibitory activity toward p53 than the full-length protein. Their presence may concur to modify the activity of flMDM4, making more complex the assessment of its function in tumor cells. It has to be mentioned that in many PTC samples we observed the presence of a MDM4 minor form whose nature is unclear, supporting the hypothesis that MDM4 variants may concur to MDM4 oncogenic functions.

]. At least in some of these samples, the simultaneous presence of MDM4-211 variant may cause such upregulation. These data further confirm the general view of the antagonistic role of MDM2 toward the oncosuppressor p53. Finally, in this study, we did not find any correlation between MDM2 and MDM4 mRNA levels, suggesting that the alterations we observed occur independently from one another.

], our findings counsel acquisition of more information on the molecular functions of this protein in different human tumors in order to carefully evaluate the application of such therapies.
