To investigate environmental factors that protect against or exacerbate obsessive-compulsive (OC) symptoms, we selected 25 monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs discordant, 17 MZ twin pairs concordant high and 34 MZ pairs concordant low on OC symptoms from a large longitudinal Dutch sample of adult twin pairs and their family members, applying stringent criteria for OC symptomatology. Data were collected on psychopathology, family structure, health, lifestyle, birth complications and life events. Unique environmental factors were studied using within-discordant MZ pair comparisons, whereas between-concordant MZ pair comparisons were used to study environmental factors that are shared by the twins of an MZ pair. The high-scoring MZ twins of the discordant group reported more life events (especially sexual abuse) than their low-scoring twin-siblings. The between-pair comparisons showed lower birth weight in the discordant MZ pairs than in the concordant MZ pairs. Further, the concordant high MZ pairs as well as their spouses had a lower educational level than the two other groups. On scale scores of anxious-depression, neuroticism, and somatic complaints, concordant high MZ pairs showed highest scores, and the discordant MZ pairs scored intermediate, except for neuroticism, on which the high-scoring twins of discordant MZ pairs were equal to the concordant high pairs. Discordance on psychological scale scores between the concordant MZ pairs was evident from 1991 onward, and within the discordant MZ pairs from 1997 onward, confirming previous reports of an association of early-onset OC symptoms with higher genetic load. Parent scores of OC symptoms and anxious-depression suggested intermediate genetic load in the discordant MZ group. In conclusion, this study reports on both unique and shared environmental factors associated with OC symptomatology. Whether these factors operate in addition to or in interaction with genetic disposition is to be elucidated in future studies.

). Environmental factors explain about half of persistence in boys and two-third of persistence in girls. Thus, environmental factors are of substantial importance in the likelihood to obtain and persist or remit with respect to OC symptomatology.

). Differences between the MZ concordant and discordant groups were described using measures of anxiety and depression co-occurring with OC behavior. The aim of this explorative study was to replicate and extend the information from previous studies on both unique and shared environmental influences that might protect against or exacerbate OC behavior. Unique environmental factors were studied using within-discordant MZ twin pair comparisons. To study environmental factors shared by both twins of a pair, between-MZ pair comparisons were used. Parent data on level of education and on drinking and smoking behavior were used to compare the groups of twin pairs on these common environment influences. Further, measures of anxiety, depression and personality were compared between the parents of the concordant and discordant twin pairs, with the following reasoning: concordance between MZ twin pairs on OC behavior most likely results from genetic similarity between the twins of a pair. Thus, the contrasts between twin pairs who are concordant high and low reflect differences in genetic vulnerability to OC behavior. As a consequence, the parent scores on OC symptoms, on anxious depression and on neuroticism (the latter characteristics are known to be related to OC symptoms) are expected to reflect these differences in genetic vulnerability and therefore to be highest in the parents of the concordant high MZ pairs, to be intermediate in the parents of the discordant MZ pairs and to be low in the parents of the concordant low MZ pairs.
2005
). We hypothesized that the concordant high MZ twin pairs, in whom the OC symptoms are theoretically more genetically determined, would show lower age at onset than the high-scoring twins of the discordant group in whom unique environmental factors might be more important.

Of the final 76 MZ twin pairs selected for this study, 18 pairs participated in wave 2002 only, 28 pairs participated in two waves, 4 pairs in three, 8 pairs in four, 13 pairs in five, and 4 pairs in all six waves.

Measures and instruments
The NTR survey contains a broad range of longitudinal measurements taken at six time points between 1991 and 2002, as well as cross-sectional measurements. Information is obtained on life events, perinatal adversities, physical and mental health, lifestyle factors such as physical activity, religiosity, drinking, smoking and drug behavior, and on demographic variables such as relationships, number of children, level of education, living situation, and work status. Since this is an exploratory study, all available information was taken into account.
Religiosity was assessed by asking whether the respondent had had a religious upbringing (yes/no), the person’s current religion, and whether the respondent currently was an active church member.

This scale gathers information on: death of a spouse, father, mother, child, sibling or significant other; serious illness or injury of self or a significant other; divorce/break-up of a relationship; traffic accident; violent and sexual assault or rape, and robbery. Response categories are: never experienced; 0–6 months ago; 6–12 months ago; 1–5 years ago, and more than 5 years ago.

Socio Economic Status (SES) in 2002 was assessed using a full description of the occupation of the twins according to the descriptions provided by the Central Office for Statistics in the Netherlands. The work level was coded into three levels based on the mental complexity of the work, ranging from low skilled (1) to academic work (3). Living situation was coded between 1 and 3 (1 = with parents; 2 = alone; 3 = with partner).
Finally, we used child-derived information on their parents’ level of education. Direct parent information was used to collect information on their smoking and drinking behavior and on their scores of OC behavior, anxiety and depression.

-tests (ordinal data). Post hoc Scheffé testing, although more liberal than Bonferroni correction, provide some correction of type I error. Two-tailed probabilities were used in all analyses, since we had no clear expectation of the direction of the findings.
To adjust for correlated error in the between-group comparisons of common environment variables, separate regression analyses (multiple regression for continuous measures and logistic regression for categorical measures) were conducted in STATA 9.2 for these variables (StatCorp, College Station, TX, USA). The robust cluster option was used to account for nonindependence of the twin pairs on the variables that reflected common environmental influences (i.e., caesarean section, birth weight, and religious upbringing of the twin; parental death and divorce, death of a sibling, and level of education, alcohol use and smoking behavior of the parents). Alpha was set at 0.05.



Results
Within-pair analyses of discordant pairs
Twenty-five MZ twin pairs discordant on OC behavior were included, of whom 18 pairs were female. Their mean age was 29.6 years (SD 6.8 years). Mean PI-R ABBR OC scores in the high-scoring twins of the discordant pairs were 21.4 (SD 5.9), in the low scoring twins 4.5 (SD 2.0).

Discussion
The most important aim of this MZ twin study has been to explore unique and shared environmental factors involved in OC symptoms.
Unique and shared environmental factors

). However, two of the low-scoring twins of the discordant pairs reported on sexual assault as well, underscoring the complexity of presumed causality in the interplay between environmental and genetic factors in OCD. Interestingly, no sexual assault was reported by the concordant high-scoring MZ twin pairs. Thus, although the high-scoring respondents of the discordant pairs show similar OC symptomatology when compared with the concordant high MZ pairs, the pathways along which similar OC symptoms develop seem to differ between the high-scoring discordant twins on the one hand, and the high-scoring concordant pairs on the other. Although one can only speculate about causal relationships in this explorative study, the OC symptoms in the high-scoring twins of the discordant pairs seem to be associated more with environmental stressors (i.e., sexual assault) than are the OC symptoms in the concordant high-scoring pairs.

). Although it might be a chance finding, one can speculate that—since caesarean section is intended to decrease perinatal adversities—the discordant group of this sample has been ‘under treated’, providing an additional negative environmental factor to explain between-group differences.
1999
). Apparently, different problem behavior is associated with different environmental risk factors.
Finally, level of education of the parents (as a measure of socio-economic status, a risk factor reported in OCD) was not found to be associated with OC symptoms in this study, although the parents of the twins who were concordant low on OC symptoms tended to have a higher level of education than the other groups, a difference that may have failed to reach significance due to the small sample size.
Finally, between-twin pair comparisons on unique life events revealed an elevated rate of dismissal in the concordant high-scoring twin pairs compared with the other pairs. Since dismissal typically represents a unique negative environmental influence on each twin of a pair, instead of being an environmental influence shared between the twins of a pair, its elevated rate among the high-scoring concordant MZ pairs is better explained as being the consequence of OC symptomatology rather than causing OC symptoms; elevated dismissal rates in these OC twin pairs might result from over-scrupulosity and slowness in work—characteristics well known in OC symptomatology—and subsequent dysfunction.

The parent data
As parent scores on OC symptoms and related psychopathology were expected to reflect genetic vulnerability, we expected scores to be highest in the concordant high parents, to be intermediate in the discordant parents and to be low in the concordant low parents. On most measures of psychopathology, this assumption was confirmed. Thus, the intermediate scores in the parents of the discordant twins on OC, anxious-depression and neuroticism scales may be the consequence of the intermediate amount of genetic vulnerability to OC symptoms in this group. Therefore, these parent data suggest that the symptoms in the high-scoring twins of the MZ discordant group are likely to be the consequence of a moderate genetic vulnerability to OC pathology in addition to or in interaction with environmental mediators.

Limitations
First, sample size is small; although we sampled from a large group of MZ twins, only a small sample was retained due to the use of rigorous criteria. Consequently, especially in the within-discordant pair comparisons, some of the negative outcomes might in fact be the result of lack of power to detect within-pair differences. Alternatively we could have relaxed the stringent selection criteria, with the disadvantage of including twin pairs not scoring in the clinical range of OCD, thus representing an unclear group of problem behavior.

).
Finally, the database used in this study was not primarily designed to specifically inquire about environmental factors, leaving some questions unanswered, especially with respect to protective environmental mediators of OC symptomatology.


Conclusion
This study has been a first attempt to identify characteristics of the environment associated with OC symptoms using a twin study design. Some important environmental factors involved in OC symptomatology have been identified. Two crucial questions to be addressed in future studies are: (1) what is the differential impact of the various environmental mediators on OC symptoms, and under which circumstances and at which age are they most harmful? (2) Along which lines do the environmental factors found in this study operate? Do they add to genetic risk factors, are they causal in themselves, or do they operate through gene–environment interaction? Future studies are needed to study the differential effects of environment and genes on phenotypes (and endophenotypes), and to elucidate the nature of the interplay between genes and environment.
