Aims/hypothesis
Insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes are associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. The aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that oxidative phosphorylation and electron transport capacity are diminished in the skeletal muscle of type 2 diabetic subjects, as a result of a reduction in the mitochondrial content.

 flux was normalised for mitochondrial DNA content or citrate synthase activity, there were no differences in oxidative phosphorylation or electron transport capacity between patients with type 2 diabetes and healthy control subjects.

Conclusions/interpretation
Mitochondrial function is normal in type 2 diabetes. Blunting of coupled and uncoupled respiration in type 2 diabetic patients can be attributed to lower mitochondrial content.

Introduction
It has been reported that insulin resistance is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction in several tissues. While mitochondria are considered central to altered metabolic pathways, leading to pathogenic processes in type 2 diabetes, the mechanisms by which mitochondrial function contributes to the disease remain to be elucidated. Whether it is insulin resistance per se, chronic hyperglycaemia, or accumulation of intracellular lipid and associated alterations in metabolic pathways that affect mitochondrial function, or vice versa, is also unclear.

 flux capacity in intact cells in human type 2 diabetes have been reported. We hypothesised that oxidative phosphorylation and electron transport capacity are diminished in the skeletal muscle of type 2 diabetic subjects, and that these changes are attributable to a reduction in muscle mitochondrial content. In the present study we tested these hypotheses by using high-resolution respirometry to quantify oxidative phosphorylation and electron transport capacity in permeabilised muscle fibres from biopsy samples of the quadriceps in healthy subjects and patients with type 2 diabetes.

Therefore, it could be argued that specific cellular signals that alter levels of mitochondria, and thus reduce electron transport (and oxidative phosphorylation capacity) per unit muscle mass, contribute to a variety of aberrant metabolic pathways, including intracellular fat accumulation, insulin resistance and glucose intolerance.

). The fact that the increase was similar in the two groups also testifies that electron transport capacity is not impaired in type 2 diabetes, and that the phosphorylation system (adenine nucleotide transporter, phosphate transporter and ATP synthase) exerts control over electron transport in patients and control subjects to the same degree.
In conclusion, the results of the present study provide the first direct evidence of normal mitochondrial function in the skeletal muscle of type 2 diabetic subjects. An apparent impairment of oxidative phosphorylation and electron transport capacity is fully accounted for by a diminished mitochondrial content in the diabetic muscle.
