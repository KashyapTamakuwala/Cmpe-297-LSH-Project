One explanation for the observed effects could be that target genes of this silencing pathway play a positive role on the vegetative phase change and their down-regulation consequently promotes juvenility. Hence, mutations in genes involved in this silencing pathway, as the ones described above, cause an accelerated vegetative development.

In order to identify plants containing the mutation we used the following primer combination: 5′-AGTAAGAGGAAACCACCATGGAGATGG-3′ (forward) and 5′-AACCTTCCACTTGGCACCTTGGTATA-3′ (reverse, recognises the insertion).

/s light. To determine sensitivity to photoperiodic induction of flowering, stratified seeds were germinated in a modified SD with a 9 h light period. The developing plants were kept in these conditions for 21 days before they were transferred to similar growth chambers with continuous light provided by Osram HQIT 400 W lamps. Batches of plants were returned to the modified SD conditions after 1, 3 and 5 days.

) was obtained by dividing the number (L) of rosette leaves having reached at least 0.5 cm in length through the number of days (D) between sowing and determination. Note that this value reflects but does not equalize (average) plastochron as it should be corrected for the true start of initiation of the first leaf as well as the time needed for the first adult leaf to reach a size of 0.5 cm.

Phylogenetic comparison
Multiple alignments of amino acid sequences were generated by the program ClustalW of the MacVector 7.2.2 software package (Accelrys Ltd., Cambridge, UK) using the BLOSUM 30 matrix with an open gap penalty of 10 and an extend gap penalty of 0.05. Only the SBP-domain was used for the phylogenetic reconstruction. The tree was constructed using the neighbour-joining algorithm of the MacVector 7.2.2 software package.

Quantifications, in triplicate, were performed using the Brilliant SYBRGreen QPCR kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA), according to the manufacturer’s protocol, in a final volume of 25 μl. PCR was carried out in 250 μl optical reaction vials (Stratagene) heated for 10 min at 95°C to hot-start the Taq polymerase, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation (30 s at 95°C), annealing (30 s at 58°C) and extension (30 s at 72°C).

Therefore, we further investigated the possibility that the observed differences correlate with relative altered timing of the vegetative phase transition.
