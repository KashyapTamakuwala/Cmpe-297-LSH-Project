Cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality is a leading cause of death in adult chronic kidney disease (CKD), with exceptionally high rates in young adults, according to the Task Force on Cardiovascular Disease. Recent data indicate that cardiovascular complications are already present in children with CKD. This review summarizes the current literature on cardiac risk factors, mortality and morbidity in children with CKD.

] of all children and adolescents who were under 20 years of age when renal replacement therapy commenced (study period was 40 years) showed mortality rates 30 times higher than in the age-matched general population; CVD was the most common cause of death (45%).

], these causes are extremely rare in children and adults younger than 30 years of age. The incidence of cardiac arrest in the youngest age group (0–4 years) was five to ten times higher than in other age groups, perhaps, as noted by the authors, a reflection of the difficulty of ascertaining the true cause of death in young children. Some of these young children might have died from other co-morbid conditions such as congenital disorders that are not included in the USRDS database.

]. It is currently unknown if LVH in young patients with CKD is characterized by structural abnormalities similar to familial or idiopathic hypertrophic cardiomyopathies associated with SCD. Whether LVH of children with ESRD can contribute to increased SCD is also not known. Another possibility for deadly arrhythmias in children with ESRD is acute changes in the cardiac extra- or intracellular ionic milieu, especially involving abnormalities of sodium- and potassium-based repolarization currents.

] appear to have an increased risk for cardiac death. Another important observation of this study is that transplant recipients had 78% lower risk of cardiac death than dialysis patients. However, the authors pointed out that the CVD mortality rate in transplanted patients was still significantly higher (approximately ten times) than in the general pediatric population.

] has confirmed that cardiac disease in children is different from adults. A total of 1,454 Medicare incident pediatric (0–19 years) dialysis patients were identified from 1991 to 1996. Among them, 452 (31.2%) developed a cardiac-related event. Arrhythmia was most common (19.6%), followed by valvular disease (11.7%), cardiomyopathy (9.6%) and cardiac arrest (3%). Ischemic heart disease was extremely rare in these children.

], describing the phenomenon of “reverse epidemiology.” The studies have shown that in adults on chronic hemodialysis low blood pressure, low body mass index (BMI), low serum cholesterol and low serum homocysteine are often correlated with an unfavorable clinical outcome. Thus, whereas traditional risk factors of CVD are correlated with an unfavorable outcome in the general population and patients with CKD not yet on dialysis, in hemodialyzed patients, mild hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and being overweight appear to be protective and associated with an improved survival. It has been speculated that a malnutrition-inflammation-atherosclerosis complex underlies, at least partly, the phenomenon of reverse epidemiology, since malnutrition causes a low BMI, hypocholesterolemia and low serum homocysteine levels.

]. The concentric LV remodeling and hypertrophy may be the results of pressure overload as occurs with hypertension, whereas eccentric LVH may be related to volume and sodium retention, anemia and arteriovenous shunt. The patterns of sarcomere formation induced by pressure or volume overload are distinct. Pressure-induced concentric LVH is characterized by a parallel addition of sarcomeres resulting in the increase of cross-sectional area and diameter of the myocytes. Increase in LVM in this case is obtained by a marked increase in wall thickness with a less evident increase in the LV cavity that yields an elevated relative wall thickness and concentric LVH. From the physiological view, increased systolic blood pressure (BP) and pulse pressure, due to increased peripheral resistance and arterial stiffness, are the principal factors opposing LV ejection and leading to an increased LV workload and concentric LVH. An increase in LVM can also be obtained by an increase in the LV cavity with a symmetric increase in wall thickness to maintain the ratio between the wall thickness and LV transversal radius (relative wall thickness) normal, producing eccentric LVH. In this case, the addition of sarcomeres occurs mainly in series resulting in longitudinal cell growth. In the transition to maladaptive LVH, LV dilatation becomes disproportional to wall thickness, with myocytes elongated without an increase in diameter.
62
63
64
]. With time, a maladaptive phase of LVH develops, characterized by decreased capillary density, decreased coronary reserve and subendocardial perfusion, a tendency to arrhythmia, and the development of myocardial fibrosis. All this leads to myocyte death and, finally, to diastolic and systolic dysfunction.
The second process involves vascular injury. Exposure to CV risk factors results in vascular changes, including atherosclerotic and arteriosclerotic processes and vascular calcification.
65
66
]. The EPC number has been shown to be reduced in patients with CVD, leading to speculation that atherosclerosis may be caused by a consumptive loss of the endothelial repair capacity. Animal experiments have shown that EPCs reendothelialise injured vessels and that this reduces neointimal formation, confirming that EPCs have an atheroprotective effect.
67
69
]. Arteriosclerosis is associated with vascular remodeling characterized by increased wall thickness, lumen enlargement and increased length of arteries. This leads to an increase of systolic BP and pulse pressure and arterial stiffening.

Spectrum of cardiovascular abnormalities in children with CKD
Over the last decade, abnormalities of the LV such as LVH and LV dysfunction, abnormalities of the large arteries such as stiffness and increased intima-medial thickness (IMT) of the carotids, and calcification of the coronaries have been accepted as early markers of cardiomyopathy and atherosclerosis. They constitute strong independent predictors of cardiac morbidity and mortality both in the general population and in adults with CKD. In children and young adults with CKD, recent studies have proven that these abnormalities are also present and that risk factors for cardiac and vascular injury in children with CKD are similar to those for adults.

Of 53 children who received a renal transplant between 1981 and 1991, 47 survived and were observed for 10 to 20 years. At the 10-year follow-up, echocardiography showed minor LVH in only two children with hypertension. No child without hypertension at 10 years post transplant had LVH.

Poor diastolic function in patients on dialysis was associated with anemia, hyperphosphatemia, increased calcium-phosphorus ion product and LVH. The clinical significance of diastolic dysfunction in pediatric patients with CKD is not known. Longitudinal studies are necessary to determine if abnormal diastolic function predicts the development of systolic dysfunction and congestive heart failure in these patients.

Five arteries had fibrous or fibroelastic intimal thickening, medial mucoid ground substance and disruption of the internal elastic lamella.

], as a part of the ESCAPE trial, investigated vascular structure and function in children with chronic renal failure and after renal transplantation. The authors demonstrated vascular abnormalities in all patient groups with the most marked changes in the dialysis patients. The degree of arteriopathy in their study was correlated with conventional CVD risk factors such as hypertension and dyslipidemia in pre-dialytic CKD, while in children on dialysis and after transplantation, hyperphosphatemia, hyperparathyroidism and treatment with calcium-containing phosphate binders were determinants of arterial abnormalities. Another important observation in this study was a significantly lower carotid IMT in children post transplant, suggesting that the vascular abnormalities partially regress. Epidemiological studies should determine if vascular abnormalities detected during childhood CKD are associated with future accelerated coronary artery disease.

Evaluation and treatment recommendations
The overall strategy in the prevention of cardiovascular complications in children with CKD is avoidance of long-term dialysis. The goal is to prevent the development and delay the progression of cardiomyopathy and atherosclerosis. The identification of modifiable risk factors and markers of CVD and early intervention should be initiated at the time of mild-to-moderate renal insufficiency, prior to the need for dialysis. Even though kidney transplantation poses a continuous CV risk (hypertension, hyperlipidemia and allograft dysfunction), it eliminates many uremia-related risks, reduces the risk of cardiac death by approximately 80 percent and prolongs the life span by 20–30 years. Thus, kidney transplantation should be the ultimate goal to minimize cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with advanced CKD. For those patients who must have long-term dialysis, the strategy is directly linked to achievement of optimal dialysis outcomes, which include aggressive monitoring and management of hypertension, dyslipidemia, calcium-phosphorus metabolism, anemia, nutrition, systemic inflammation and other dialysis complications.

]. Current K/DOQI guidelines for treatment of anemia recommend keeping the hemoglobin level above 11 g/dl by using an appropriate iron therapy and recombinant erythropoietin. In the opinion of the Working Group, there is insufficient evidence to recommend routinely maintaining hemoglobin levels above 13 g/dl or more.

].
For adolescents with stage 5 CKD and a level of LDL ≥130 mg/dl, K/DOQI recommends treatment to reduce LDL to <130 mg/dl. If LDL is <130 mg/dl, fasting triglycerides ≥200 mg/dl and non-HDL cholesterol (total cholesterol minus HDL) ≥160 mg/dl, treatment should be considered to reduce non-HDL cholesterol to <160 mg/dl. All children with dyslipidemia should follow the recommendations for therapeutic lifestyle changes (TLC), which include diet modification with a reduction in saturated fat intake and increase in fiber intake, and moderate physical activity. Adolescents should be counseled about avoiding smoking. Unfortunately, non-compliance with TLC is one of the major problems in the management of dyslipidemia in adolescents. Pediatric nephrologists must also recognize that appropriate caloric intake, including calories from fat, should be emphasized to avoid malnutrition and ensure normal growth and development, especially in young children. If LDL cholesterol is ≥160 mg/dl and non-HDL cholesterol ≥190 mg/dl, statin therapy is recommended in children older than 10 years.
