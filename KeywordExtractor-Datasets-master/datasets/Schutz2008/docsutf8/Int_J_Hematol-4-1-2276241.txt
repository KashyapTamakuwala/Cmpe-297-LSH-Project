]. The WHO and FAB classifications differ in several aspects. The blast threshold required for a diagnosis of AML was reduced from 30 to 20%, and new AML categories have been added for cytogenetic abnormalities, the presence of multilineage dysplasia (MLD), as well as a history of chemotherapy and subtypes for acute basophilic leukemia, acute panmyelosis with myelofibrosis, and myeloid sarcoma. The WHO classification comprises more subtypes and is more comprehensive than the FAB classification.

In the present study, we reviewed stained smears of blood and bone marrow from patients who were registered in the Japan Adult Leukemia Study Group (JALSG) AML-97 trial, and classified them into FAB subtypes and WHO categories. We also evaluated their survival on the basis of the WHO classification, the myeloperoxidase (MPO)-positivity of blasts, and cytogenetic findings including 11q23 abnormalities.

Patients and methods
Patients
Between December 1997 and July 2001, 809 patients aged from 15 to 66 years with untreated AML (excluding M3) were registered from 103 institutions in the AML-97 trial of the JALSG. The patients were diagnosed with AML according to the FAB criteria at each institution. Patients with a history of MDS, hematological abnormalities before the diagnosis of AML, or a history of chemotherapy were not eligible for the AML-97 trial.

Discussion
t
(15;17), a history of MDS, or preceding hematological abnormalities, or who had previously undergone chemotherapy, were not eligible for the present study. However, multicenter trials might have some advantages in diagnosing AML according to the WHO classification, because morphological diagnoses and karyotypes are reviewed by the corresponding institutional committees.

]. This method might cause the frequency of the first WHO category to increase. Thus, the multiplex RT-PCR assay might have to be incorporated into the WHO system. The JALSG has started a cohort study in which all AML patients in participating hospitals are registered and analyzed according to the WHO classification. That study should clarify the real ratios of the AML subtypes in the WHO classification.

 = 0.22). Some problems are associated with the analyses of 11q23 abnormalities. We had few patients with these abnormalities, particularly individual translocations, and genetic analysis was not performed. Thus, the prognostic risk of 11q23 abnormalities cannot be concluded from the present study. Nonetheless, these abnormalities were never associated with a favorable risk. To classify 11q23 abnormalities into each prognostic risk group, further investigations and genetic analyses of a large number of patients with 11q23 abnormalities are required.

]. If these genetic markers can be confirmed as being of clinical significance, genetic analyses will probably be incorporated into the WHO classification.
In summary, our results confirmed those of previous studies showing the prognostic significance of cytogenetics, MLD, and MPO-positivity of blasts in AML. Furthermore, we categorized patients with de novo AML according to the WHO classification and showed the clinical characteristics and OS of each category.


We thank the clinicians and leaders of all the institutions who entered their patients into the JALSG AML-97 study and provided the necessary data to make this study possible. This work was supported in part by a grant from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan.
