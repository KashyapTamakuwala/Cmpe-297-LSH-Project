Summary
The present study estimated the 10-year probability using the Japanese version of WHO fracture risk assessment tool (FRAX™) in order to determine fracture probabilities that correspond to intervention thresholds currently used in Japan and to resolve some issues for its use in Japan.

Introduction
The objective of the present study was to evaluate a Japanese version of the WHO fracture risk assessment (FRAX™) tool to compute 10-year probabilities of osteoporotic fracture in Japanese men and women. Since lumbar spine bone mineral density (BMD) is used preferentially as a site for assessment, and densitometers use Japanese reference data, a second aim was to investigate the suitability and impact of this practice in Japan.

Methods
Fracture probabilities were computed from published data on the fracture and death hazards in Japan. Probabilities took account of age, sex, the presence of clinical risk factors and femoral neck BMD. Fracture probabilities were determined that were equivalent to intervention thresholds currently used in Japan. The difference between T-scores derived from international reference data and that using Japanese-specific normal ranges was estimated from published sources. The gradient of risk of BMD for fracture in Japan was compared to that for BMD at the lumbar spine in the Hiroshima cohort.

Results
The 10-year probabilities of a major osteoporosis-related fracture that corresponded to current intervention thresholds ranged from approximately 5% at the age of 50 years to more than 20% at the age of 80 years. The use of femoral neck BMD predicts fracture as well as or better than BMD tests at the lumbar spine. There were small differences in T-scores between those used for the model and those derived from a Japanese reference population.

Conclusions
The FRAX™ tool has been used to determine possible thresholds for therapeutic intervention, based on equivalence of risk with current guidelines. The approach will need to be supported by appropriate health economic analyses. Femoral neck BMD is suitable for the prediction of fracture risk among Japanese. However, when applying the FRAX™ model to Japan, T-scores and Z-scores should be converted to those derived from the international reference.

Against this background, additional aims of the present study were to provide fracture probabilities based on the FRAX™ tool that were equivalent to currently accepted intervention thresholds, explore the impact of using Japanese-specific normative data for femoral neck BMD, and reassess the respective performance characteristics of BMD at the femoral neck and lumbar spine.

In this paper, we focused on its application to decision-making in clinical practice with the estimation of intervention threshold i.e., the fracture probability at which intervention is currently considered to be worthwhile. The approach should be distinguished from intervention thresholds that are based on health economic analysis.

), ranging from approximately 5% at the age of 50 years to more than 20% at the age of 80 years. Against this background, a 10-year probability of 10% for osteoporosis-related fracture may be an acceptable intervention threshold for Japan, though an optimization should take account of health economic consequences for individuals and for the health care budget.

]. The difference was not, however, large (approximately a half a SD). There were also differences in the SD which was smaller in Japanese women than in the NHANES III sample (0.107 and 0.120 g/cm2, respectively). Not surprisingly, the DXA-based T-score obtained from Japanese and USA populations differed as did the computed probabilities. Although the differences were small at low T-scores, when applying the FRAX™ model to Japan, it is preferable to program the system so that the Japanese T- and Z-scores are converted into the appropriate T- and Z-scores based on NHANES III.
In conclusion, a FRAX™ tool has been developed to compute fracture probabilities calibrated to the epidemiology of Japan. The tool has been used to determine possible thresholds for therapeutic intervention, based on equivalence of risk with current guidelines. The approach will need to be supported by appropriate health economic analyses. The present study indicates that the femoral neck BMD is suitable for prediction of the risk for fracture among Japanese people. However, when applying the FRAX™ model to Japan, T-scores and Z-scores should be converted into those derived from the international reference.
