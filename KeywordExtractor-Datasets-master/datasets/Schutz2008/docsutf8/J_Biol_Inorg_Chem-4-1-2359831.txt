Taq
 polymerase recognizes the resulting DNA damage as different from that for unmodified cisplatin. The sequence-selective cleavage has been investigated by high-resolution gel electrophoresis on a 36-bp DNA fragment. Sequence-selective cleavages are observed in the close proximity of the platinum sites for the strand exhibiting the preferential platinum binding sites. The platinum moiety also coordinates to the other DNA strand, most likely leading only to mono guanine or adenine adducts.

Comparison of the platinum–ODN adducts formed with the different complexes
5′-end-labeled ODN I (2 μM) was annealed to 1 equiv of its complementary strand ODN II in 1,100 μL of Tris–HCl (20 mM, pH 7.2) by heating to 90 °C for 5 min, followed by slow cooling to room temperature. Then, 60 μL of this solution was incubated with 60 μL of the complex solution (6 or 20 μM) for 20 h at 37 °C, followed by precipitation with 100 μL of sodium acetate buffer (3 M, pH 5.2) and 1,300 μL of cold ethanol. Pellets were rinsed with ethanol and lyophilized. Samples were dissolved in formamide containing bromophenol blue and xylene cyanol and heated for 3 min at 90 °C before being loaded on the gel. Platinum–DNA adducts were analyzed by denaturing 20% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, then by phosphorimagery.

The noncoordinated complexes were removed by precipitation before the cleavage was initiated by the addition of ascorbic acid (0.2 mM) under aerobic conditions.

However, the smears observed in lanes 10 and 15 are partially converted into bands, indicating that some cleavage products, arising from the oxidation of deoxyribose, are sensitive to alkaline conditions.

 (results not shown). Therefore, these alkaline conditions are sufficient to induce a redox activity of the copper complex part of the hybrid molecule [this phenomenon has not been observed with Cu(3-Clip-Phen), which can be removed during a precipitation step preceding the heating in the presence of piperidine]. Interestingly, only the Pt–ODN I adducts are cleaved; none of the free ODN I is degraded and selective cleavages are observed around the position of adducts detected during primer extension experiments. Unfortunately, this activity of the copper complexes covalently linked to the target does not allow us to analyze whether or not the dual Pt–Cu complexes perform the oxidation of nucleobases.

. The opposite strand also contains Pt–DNA adducts, but no clear sequence selectivity is observed, most likely owing to the lack of preferential platinum binding sites. These atypical platinum adducts lead to the partial damage of the other DNA strand, as is clearly evidenced by comparison of the cleavage products on a single-stranded or duplex DNA.
