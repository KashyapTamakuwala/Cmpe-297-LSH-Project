Biofilms are complex aggregates formed by microorganisms such as bacteria, fungi and algae, which grow at the interfaces between water and natural or artificial materials. They are actively involved in processes of sorption and desorption of metal ions in water and reflect the environmental conditions in the recent past. Therefore, biofilms can be used as bioindicators of water quality. The goal of this study was to determine whether the biofilms, developed in different aquatic systems, could be successfully discriminated using data on their elemental compositions. Biofilms were grown on natural or polycarbonate materials in flowing water, standing water and seawater bodies. Using an unsupervised technique such as principal component analysis (PCA) and several supervised methods like classification and regression trees (CART), discriminant partial least squares regression (DPLS) and uninformative variable elimination–DPLS (UVE-DPLS), we could confirm the uniqueness of sea biofilms and make a distinction between flowing water and standing water biofilms. The CART, DPLS and UVE-DPLS discriminant models were validated with an independent test set selected either by the Kennard and Stone method or the duplex algorithm. The best model was obtained from CART with 100% correct classification rate for the test set designed by the Kennard and Stone algorithm. With CART, one variable describing the Mg content in the biofilm water phase was found to be important for the discrimination of flowing water and standing water biofilms.

The aim of this work is to investigate whether the biofilms grown in different aquatic systems can be discriminated on the basis of their chemical compositions. If the discrimination is possible, the next interesting question will be which measured parameters are responsible for it.

]. The Saale water and biofilm samples were collected within a 2-year period (from September 2003 till October 2005). The sampling point was situated in the village of Kunitz located downstream of Jena (Thuringia, Germany). This place was preferred, because it reflects a characteristic pollution of the nearby town. The Saale river is there about 1.5 m deep and Kunitz is remote from civilisation. These conditions facilitated the sampling campaign.
A small pond of 0.75-m depth was selected as a typical example of a standing water body. It was located in the city of Jena. The sampling campaign duration was the same as for the sampling campaign in the Saale river. At these two locations, the biofilms were artificially grown on polycarbonate plates (10 cm × 10 cm) exposed vertically to the water (in the Saale river, in a streaming direction). The plates were fixed into polypropylene boxes, approximately 10 cm under the water surface and 1 m away from the riverbank. After a definite time of exposure, the biofilm samples were immediately transferred into plastic boxes filled with the river or pond water and transported to the laboratory. The plates were then washed with bidistilled water and the biofilm samples were scraped off the whole surface of the polycarbonate plates using a Teflon spatula. The river and pond water samples were collected every 2 weeks.
The Leutra river, located in the city of Jena, was chosen as the second example of a flowing water body. The stony bed of the river, its small depth and good accessibility facilitated the sampling campaign. The biofilm samples from the Leutra river were scraped off the riverbed stones using a plastic spatula. They were placed into polyethylene bottles and transported to the laboratory. The sampling campaign at the Leutra river was held in autumn 2005 and in spring 2006. Additionally, water samples were collected.
The sampling procedure, for water and uniquely sampled biofilms, was the same as that carried out for the Leutra river. The locations of the sampling sites were selected according to the availability of a suitable sampling device. The samples collected were also placed into polyethylene bottles and transported to the laboratory.

Analytical procedure
The biofilm samples collected were air-dried at 105 °C. Then, the samples containing 10–50 mg biofilm powder were dissolved in 3 ml of 70–72% perchloric acid and were heated for 3 h at 50 °C. The remaining dry matter of each sample was further dissolved in water so that the resulting solution was up to 5 ml. A Fisons Instruments (Beverly, MA, USA) Maxim 112 inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer was used to analyse Al, Ca, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Na and Sr, while Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Ni, P, Se and Zn were determined with a PerkinElmer (Wellesley, MA, USA) Elan 6000 inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer. An external aqueous calibration was adopted for the analysis by ICP-OES, while a standard addition procedure was used for the element analysis by ICP-MS. All contents correspond to the sample dry weight. The trueness of the measurements was tested by analysing a certified reference algae material. The element contents were certified for an aqua regia digestion. Additionally, the element contents were determined after microwave digestion with nitric acid. No differences between these two digestion methods were obtained. All the measurements were done in triplicate and the relative standard deviation of the technique was 10–15% for all the biofilms, indicating good repeatability of the measurements.

The cutoff value is defined as the largest absolute value of all stability values for the random variables added.
The goodness of a discrimination model is characterised by the percentage of correct classification or the so-called correct classification rate. It is commonly agreed that the higher the correct classification rate, the better the model. Additionally, one should consider sensitivity and selectivity of the model. For a two-class problem for instance, sensitivity is defined as the percentage of correctly classified samples of class A, while selectivity is the percentage of correctly classified samples of class B.

] that Mg strongly influences attachment and biofilm structure. The surface colonisation and biofilm depth increase with the increasing Mg concentration. The biofilms collected in Punta Skala, Nin and Majorca contain higher levels of dissolved salts in the water phase and higher Fe and Mg contents in comparison with the biofilms collected in Travemünde, Damp and Steinbeck. The sample originating from Munich shows a high anthropogenic influence, i.e. it has higher Mn, Zn, Cd, Pb, Fe and Co contents in the water phase and lower Fe and Mg contents in the biofilm in comparison with the other samples.
In order to see whether the biofilms developed in standing water could be distinguished from the biofilms grown in flowing water, supervised approaches such as CART, DPLS and UVE-DPLS were applied. Furthermore, it was important to determine if the models constructed could predict the origin of new biofilm samples and how well. Another question to be answered was what variables are responsible for an eventual discrimination of groups. Only seven biofilms were grown in seawater; therefore, they were excluded from the forthcoming analysis.

] algorithms enabling a uniform subset selection. In the Kennard and Stone method, objects in the model set are selected sequentially, starting with the object closest to the data mean. The next object included in the subset is the one situated furthest away from the first one. The third object selected is the most distant one from the objects selected in the model set. The selection of objects continues while a predefined number of objects are not assigned to the model set. The remaining objects form the test set. As a similarity measure, the Euclidian distance was used. With the duplex algorithm, the two most distant objects in the data are found and included in the model set. The next two most distant objects are assigned to the test set. The remaining objects are consecutively added to the subsets, switching over to the most distant unassigned object with respect to the model set and to the most distant unassigned object with respect to the test set. The Kennard and Stone algorithm ensures that the objects in the model set cover all possible sources of data variance, while the duplex method guarantees the representativeness of both subsets. Selection of model and test sets should be done for each group separately. When a preprocessing procedure is required, the selection of objects is applied to preprocessed data. In our study, the model and test sets were selected using autoscaled data in order to remove the scale differences among variables while evaluating the Euclidean distances among objects. It should be mentioned that the performance of CART is not influenced by autoscaling. In our study, the model set of dimension 42 × 34 contains 21 flowing water and 21 standing water biofilm samples, whereas the test set of dimension 22 × 34 includes 15 biofilms of flowing water and seven biofilms of standing water.

).
The best discrimination results are obtained from CART, even though this model shows a misclassification error of 9.5% for the complete tree. Since the splits are done in a univariate way, the correlation between variables is not taken into account. Therefore, CART provides unsatisfactory results when a linear combination of variables is responsible for discriminating the samples. This, however, cannot be verified unless multivariate approaches such as DPLS and UVE-DPLS are used. Although CART and UVE-DPLS have different objective functions, common variables are selected as essential for the discrimination. The primary variable, W-Mg, and two competitive variables, W-Ca and W-Sr, in CART are also selected by UVE-DPLS.

). All the methods allow a correct prediction for 86.4% of samples. The samples collected at Chemnitz and White Dak Pond, Metebach, are improperly classified by all methods. In fact, this is not a striking observation though when the data contain some samples that are different in comparison with the majority of samples. These samples are always assigned to the model set using the Kennard and Stone method and then the test samples are correctly predicted. Using the duplex method, we assigned some atypical samples to the test set, which results in a construction of models with too pessimistic predictive abilities.

d, e), PC 1 is again associated with the salt content of the biofilm water phases, while PC 2 probably is now linked to the contamination of the biofilm water phases, because the variables W-Zn, W-Cd, W-Ni, W-Fe, W-Co, W-Mn and W-Pb possess high loading values. PC 3 consists of Zn, Cd and Pb, which are usually associated with an anthropogenic influence and this factor is therefore associated with contaminants accumulated by the biofilm. Summarising the results of PCA, one can additionally point out that the biofilm samples collected in Majorca, Punta Skala and Nin are richer in Zn, Cd and Pb in comparison with the remaining sea biofilm samples. Moreover, the highest Zn, Cd and Pb contents are characteristic for the biofilm sample from Celle.

]. A remedy for this problem is to reduce the number of variables by the use of a feature selection technique, e.g. UVE-DPLS. The UVE-DPLS model has RMSCV of 0.95. One variable, namely W-Pb, is selected. However, all biofilms grown in flowing water are correctly classified with the model constructed, but all biofilms grown in standing water are improperly classified.


Conclusions
Discrimination between sea biofilms and the remaining standing water and flowing water biofilms is straightforward by investigating the score plots obtained from PCA. The loading plots emphasise the expected higher salt content of the water phases extracted from the sea biofilms as well as their higher levels of Fe and Mg in comparison with the other biofilms. A further discrimination between flowing water and standing water biofilms is possible by means of supervised methods like CART, DPLS and UVE-DPLS. The best discriminant model is obtained from CART. One variable describing the Mg content in the water phase (W-Mg) is enough to build a model with 9.5% misclassification error. All test samples selected by the Kennard and Stone algorithm are correctly classified using the constructed CART model. The DPLS and UVE-DPLS methods do not outperform CART for the data set studied and, therefore, it can be pointed out that a linear combination of explanatory variables does not lead to a better prediction for new samples. Moreover, CART appears as a very simple and efficient discriminant technique leading to a straightforward data interpretation in terms of explanatory variables. Hence, CART can be considered as a pilot discriminant approach. When the CART model is not satisfactory, one can apply discriminant methods, such as DPLS and UVE-DPLS, or if necessary to use a nonlinear multivariate classifier like, e.g., support vector machines.
All discriminant models, CART, DPLS and UVE-DPLS, lead to 86.4% correct classification for the test set designed by the duplex algorithm. However, CART uses only one variable (W-Mg), UVE-DPLS selects nine variables and DPLS uses all explanatory variables to build the model.
Discrimination of flowing water and standing water biofilms that are uniquely sampled, using CART, DPLS and UVE-DPLS models, is done only for a better understanding of the data collected. For a definite conclusion whether these two groups of samples can be discriminated, more samples are required to properly validate the discriminant models.
