Spinal cord injury results in progressive waves of secondary injuries, cascades of noxious pathological mechanisms that substantially exacerbate the primary injury and the resultant permanent functional deficits. Secondary injuries are associated with inflammation, excessive cytokine release, and cell apoptosis. The purine nucleoside guanosine has significant trophic effects and is neuroprotective, antiapoptotic in vitro, and stimulates nerve regeneration. Therefore, we determined whether systemic administration of guanosine could protect rats from some of the secondary effects of spinal cord injury, thereby reducing neurological deficits. Systemic administration of guanosine (8 mg/kg per day, i.p.) for 14 consecutive days, starting 4 h after moderate spinal cord injury in rats, significantly improved not only motor and sensory functions, but also recovery of bladder function. These improvements were associated with reduction in the inflammatory response to injury, reduction of apoptotic cell death, increased sparing of axons, and preservation of myelin. Our data indicate that the therapeutic action of guanosine probably results from reducing inflammation resulting in the protection of axons, oligodendrocytes, and neurons and from inhibiting apoptotic cell death. These data raise the intriguing possibility that guanosine may also be able to reduce secondary pathological events and thus improve functional outcome after traumatic spinal cord injury in humans.

Materials and methods
Animals
Adult female Wistar rats (280–300 g body weight, Charles River) were maintained in a temperature-controlled vivarium on a 12:12-h light-dark cycle with food and tap water freely available. Rats were handled daily for 2 weeks before surgery.

The rats were rated on a scale of 0 to 21, 0 being no function and 21 being normal. If the animal stopped moving for a minute, it was placed again in the center of the open field; otherwise it was left undisturbed for the duration of the 5-min test period.

A normal rat spreads the toes of its hind leg wide apart and generally holds them apart for several seconds. After spinal cord injury, this response is sometimes lost completely, or reduced in magnitude.

After SCI the rats were not capable initially of spontaneous micturition, and their bladders were manually expressed twice daily. The volume of expressed urine was measured each time, and the data were used to estimate the initiation of LUT function after SCI.

]. Briefly, the cryostat sections were thawed, air-dried, and then incubated in hydrogen peroxide to reduce endogenous peroxidase activity, before being rinsed in PBS. The sections were then incubated in 1% sodium borohydride for 15 min. After thorough washing with PBS, the sections were treated with PBS/5% normal goat serum with 0.3% Triton X-100 at room temperature for 30 min. Overnight incubation with primary antibody was performed in humidified boxes at 4°C. Macrophages and reactive microglia were detected with a mouse monoclonal antibody against ED-1 (MCA 341R, 1:500; Serotec, Hornby, ON, Canada) and reactive astrocytes (astrogliosis) were determined with rabbit anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) polyclonal antibodies (Zymed® Lab-SA System Kit, dilution was 1:600, Invitrogen Canada Inc., Burlington, ON, Canada). The following day, sections were rinsed with PBS and incubated with either rhodamine-conjugated or fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated secondary antibodies. Sections were then rinsed, coverslipped, and examined under a confocal microscope.To determine the spared axons and myelin, double fluorescent immunolabeling was performed, combining mouse monoclonal antibodies against neurofilament (RT-97, 1:10; Developmental Hybridoma Bank) and rabbit anti-myelin basic protein (MBP) polyclonal antibodies (1:50; Chemicon Int., Temecula, CA, USA). For double immunolabeling, sections were developed using a mixture of FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG in 1% normal goat serum and 0.25% Triton X-100; 1:200 (Invitrogen Canada Inc., Burlington, ON, Canada) for 2 h. Sections were then rinsed, coverslipped, and examined under a confocal microscope. An investigator who was blinded to the treatment groups conducted histological analysis.

], it seemed likely that increasing the concentration of guanosine in the central nervous system after injury in vivo might also be neuroprotective. We found that within 7 min of systemic administration, guanosine enters and progressively accumulates in the central nervous system (unpublished data), where it is converted to guanine. It remains to be determined whether guanosine, guanine, or both are the active neuroprotective agent. However, guanosine is more readily deliverable than guanine as a potential neuroprotectant.

]. The ascending spinothalamic tracts mediate the perception of pain and temperature below the level of the lesion. Since all of these motor and sensory functions were better in guanosine-treated animals than in control animals, it appears that guanosine preserved the function of multiple long tracts. This was associated with increased axonal survival and myelin preservation.

]. Our data revealed that in guanosine-treated rats, residual urine volume was not only much less than in controls from the first day after the spinal cord injury, but that by 7 days after spinal cord injury micturition had returned to normal. Because guanosine began to exert a neuroprotective effect on both motor and bladder function soon after it was first administered, its neuroprotective effect on each may involve similar mechanisms.
21
61
]. As guanosine attenuated the activation and proliferation of microglia/macrophages following SCI, this may at least in part provide an explanation for its neuroprotective effect.

]. In the present study, guanosine significantly suppressed apoptosis in the injured spinal cords when it was systemically administered daily for 2 weeks beginning 4 h after injury. It seems reasonable to postulate that decreasing apoptosis may be an important mechanism through which guanosine improves neurological outcome after SCI.

]. However, it appears unlikely that increases in intracellular cAMP are responsible for the effects of guanosine since the principal effect of cAMP in enhancing recovery from spinal cord injury appears to be due to its ability to promote axonal regeneration. In contrast, the neuroprotective effects we observed early after administration of guanosine are unlikely to be explained on the basis of outgrowth of damaged axons. A much longer time frame could be required for this to occur.
28
67
]. The ability of guanosine to stimulate production and release of trophic factors may not only have early effects, but also may contribute to the reduced number of apoptotic cells observed 3 weeks after the injury.
This study is important not only because it is the first to demonstrate the neuroprotective effect of systemically administered guanosine in acute spinal cord injury, but also because it indicates some of the potential mechanisms whereby guanosine may exert its neuroprotective effects in vivo. This work provides a basis for further exploration of the purinergic mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective effects of exogenous guanosine. Furthermore, and of potential clinical importance, is that guanosine was effective when it was administered 4 h after the injury—a realistic time frame in which to initiate treatment after spinal cord injury in humans.
