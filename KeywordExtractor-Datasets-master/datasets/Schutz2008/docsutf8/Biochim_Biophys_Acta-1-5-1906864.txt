Abstract

 (oxCRLPs) or incorporation of the antioxidant, probucol (pCRLPs) into the particles. oxCRLPs caused significantly less accumulation of triacylglycerol in the macrophages than CRLPs, and their rate of uptake was lower, while pCRLPs caused more lipid accumulation and were taken up faster. Uptake of all 3 types of particles was inhibited to a similar extent when entry via the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor related protein (80–90%), LDL receptor (− 30–40%), CD36 (− 40%) and phagocytosis (− 35–40%) was blocked using lactoferrin, excess LDL, anti-CD36 and cytochalasin D, respectively, but blocking scavenger receptors-A or -B1 using poly inosinic acid or excess HDL had no effect. These findings show that oxidation of CRLPs lowers their rate of uptake and induction of lipid accumulation in macrophages. However, oxidation does not change the main pathways of internalisation of CRLPs into THP-1 macrophages, which occur mainly via the LRP with some contribution from the LDLr, while CD36 and phagocytosis have only a minor role, regardless of the oxidative state of the particles. Thus, the effects of CMR oxidation on foam cell formation contrast sharply with those of LDL oxidation and this may be important in the role of dietary oxidized lipids and antioxidants in modulating atherosclerosis.

, it is important to establish whether the oxidative state also alters the mechanisms of uptake of CMR by the cells.
The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of the oxidative state of CMR on their uptake by macrophages and on the accumulation of lipid within the cells, and to determine how oxidation affects the pathways involved in the internalisation of the particles. Chylomicron remnant-like particles (CRLPs) at three different levels of oxidation (CRLPs, oxidized CRLPs (oxCRLPs) and CRLPs containing the antioxidant probucol (pCRLPs)) and macrophages derived from the human monocyte cell line THP-1 were used as the experimental model, and the mechanisms of uptake were evaluated using specific inhibitors of the processes believed to be involved. The findings clearly demonstrate that oxidation of CRLPs reduces the rate of their uptake by THP-1 macrophages and decreases lipid accumulation in the cells, and further show that this is due to differential interaction with apoE dependent receptors.

The blocking antibody for CD36 was obtained from Immunodiagnostic Systems Ltd (Tyne and Wear, UK) and cholesterol oxidase from Merck Biosciences Ltd (Nottingham, UK).

). These results clearly demonstrate that oxidation of CMR inhibits their uptake by macrophages and attenuates foam cell formation. This is an important new finding, since this effect is strikingly different from that found with LDL, where oxidation is required to induce macrophages to form foam cells.

, and the present study, which shows a decrease of about 73% in LDLr mRNA and a 2.7fold rise in LRP mRNA after exposure of the macrophages to CRLPs, is in agreement with these findings.
Fig. 5
[39]
[39,40]
. The different rates of uptake of CRLPs oxCRLPs and pCRLPs by macrophages demonstrated here, therefore, could be explained by effects on interaction with the LDLr and the LRP caused by differences both in the conformation of apoE and in the number of apoE molecules able to bind to the receptors, even though the total amount of apoE associated with the particles is not changed. Although we cannot rule out the possibility that the faster internalization of pCRLPs is due a specific effect of probucol on the surface structure of the particles, the finding that CRLPs are taken up more slowly after oxidation and more rapidly when the antioxidant is present suggests the changes are more likely to be related to the amounts of oxidized lipid in the particles.

). Thus, SR-A and SR-B1 do not appear to play a significant part in the uptake of oxCRLPs by macrophages, although CD36 may have a role which is unaffected by the oxidative state of the particles.

[21]
 who were unable to detect binding of chylomicron remnants to a protein with a molecular weight corresponding to the apoB48 receptor in THP-1 macrophages have suggested that it may be specific for VLDL remnants rather than chylomicron remnants.
The results of this study demonstrate that oxidative modification of CMR as compared to LDL has profoundly different effects on the uptake of the particles and the subsequent induction of lipid accumulation in macrophages. Instead of markedly enhancing foam cell formation, oxidation of CMR slows their uptake by macrophages and reduces the amount of lipid subsequently accumulated in the cells. This difference may be due to the different receptor mechanisms involved, since oxidation of LDL shifts the main route of uptake from the regulated LDLr to the unregulated scavenger receptors, while our experiments suggest that CMR are taken up mainly by the LRP with some contribution from the LDLr, with CD36 and phagocytosis playing only minor roles, irrespective of their oxidative state. These findings provide important new information about the way in which oxidation of CMR influences their induction of foam cell formation and the mechanisms involved, and has important implications for the role of dietary factors such as oxidized lipids and antioxidants which are transported in CMR in the promotion of atherosclerosis.
