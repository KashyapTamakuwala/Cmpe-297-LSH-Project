IHI and measures of corticospinal excitability were not intercorrelated. In conclusion, task-related increases in interhemispheric inhibition seem to diminish with advancing age. This phenomenon is specific for long-latency IHI and may underlie the age-related bihemispheric activation seen in functional imaging studies. The mechanism underlying changes in IHI with advancing age and the association with changes in corticospinal excitability need further investigation.

The main purpose of this study was to investigate whether normal aging has an effect on the task-related modulation of IHI measured at two different latencies, 10 and 40 ms. We hypothesized that with increasing age there would be less extra activation in the inhibitory circuits targeting the M1 ipsilateral to the moving hand. In order to gain some insight of the mechanisms and the physiological meaning of these changes we also performed measures of corticospinal excitability on the side contralateral to the moving hand and looked for correlations with age and IHI measures.

Methods
Subjects
Thirty healthy right-handed volunteers (mean age 42.9 years, range 19–78; 30% female) participated in the study after giving informed consent. They reported no history of neurological illness, psychiatric history, vascular disease or hypertension and they were not taking regular medication. The study was approved by local Ethics Committee.

Transcranial magnetic stimulation
Subjects were seated in an armchair with their eyes open. EMGs were recorded via Ag/AgCl electrodes placed over the First Dorsal Intersosseus (FDI) bilaterally, using a belly-tendon montage. Signals were filtered (30 Hz to 10 kHz), amplified using a Digitimer 360 (Digitimer Ltd, Welwyn Garden City, Herts., UK) and stored on computer via a Power 1401 data acquisition interface (Cambridge Electronic Design Ltd, Cambridge, UK). Analysis of data was carried out using Signal Software (Cambridge Electronic Design).
Two figure-of-eight coils connected to two monophasic Magstim 200 stimulators were used for the experiments (all Magstim Co., UK). A 70-mm coil was used for motor hot spot identification and threshold measurements on both sides of the brain. The motor hotspot was defined as the scalp location where TMS consistently resulted in the largest MEP. The resting motor threshold (RMT) was defined as the lowest intensity needed to evoke an EMG response of 50 μV in 50% of the trials with the FDI relaxed; the active motor threshold (AMT) was defined as the intensity which evoked a 200 μV EMG response in 50% of the trials with a background FDI contraction of 10–15% of the maximum voluntary contraction (MVC). For all studies requiring activation of the FDI, visual feedback was provided using an oscilloscope.
A recruitment curve (RC) for the active MEP amplitude elicited in the left FDI was obtained using the 70 mm coil while the subjects maintained a background FDI contraction of 15–20% MVC. Ten MEPs were collected and averaged at the following stimulus intensities: 90, 100, 110, 120, 140, 150, 160 and 170% AMT. The contraction level was tested by measuring the mean value of the rectified EMG in the 80 ms preceding the TMS pulse. The averaged peak-to-peak amplitude of the unrectified MEPs was then expressed as a ratio of the maximum peak-to-peak amplitude of the unrectified compound action potential (CMAP) evoked by supramaximal electrical stimulation of the ulnar nerve at the wrist using a Digitimer pulse stimulator (model DS7).

IHI therefore reflects the change seen in the IHI targeting the right motor cortex when the right hand is active. Values <1 reflect stronger inhibition, while values >1 reflect less inhibition.

Statistical analysis
Analysis was performed using SPSS v.14 (SPSS Inc., USA). Exploratory plotting and statistical tests (Shapiro-Wilk) confirmed normal distribution for most variables. Some of the variables were skewed by a single outlier and this could not be corrected by logarithmic transformations; the outlier was therefore discarded from the dataset to allow use of parametric tests.

), has shown that activation of the target muscle results in a reduction in the IHI targeting the active M1 (the opposite direction than the one studied here) measured at 8 ms but has little effect on the IHI40. We have shown that advancing age has an effect on the modulation of IHI during voluntary muscle contraction at 40 ms but not at 10 ms. We have thus provided additional evidence that IHI10 and IHI40 may respond differently to dynamic changes within the motor system and thus may represent physiologically distinct phenomena. This evidence could be strengthened in the future by testing the effect of age on IHI in both directions, i.e. the IHI targeting the motor cortices ipsilateral and contralateral to the moving hand.

IHI40 does not reflect an adaptation to the failing corticospinal pathways. However, it should be kept in mind that if compensatory mechanisms are indeed operating with increasing age (or decreasing corticospinal output) TMS may not measure the real deficit but the compensated deficit. The next reasonable step could be to study a series of elderly individuals known to have different levels of manual dexterity and look for correlations between electrophysiological and behavioural measures, including mirror movements during performance of complex motor tasks.

). We propose that increasing age does have a detrimental effect on the total output of primary motor cortex and that the mechanisms underlying (or compensating for) this effect are variable; thus a summary variable such as the AUC might be more suitable as a surrogate marker of overall corticospinal output.
In conclusion, this study has shown for the first time that there is an age-related reduction in the extra inhibition targeting the right hemisphere during an isometric handgrip with the right hand. These changes may underlie the bihemispheric pattern of activation seen in functional imaging studies of older individuals performing a unimanual hand task. Should our findings be confirmed, studies of interhemispheric balance may prove to be a useful marker of reorganization in the aging brain.
