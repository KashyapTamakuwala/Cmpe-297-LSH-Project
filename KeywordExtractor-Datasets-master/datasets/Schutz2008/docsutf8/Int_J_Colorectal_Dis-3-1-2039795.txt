Background
Lymph node status is the most important predictive factor in colorectal carcinoma. Recurrences occur in 20% of the patients without lymph node metastases. The sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy is a tool to facilitate identification of micrometastatic disease and aberrant lymphatic drainage. We studied the feasibility of in vivo SLN detection in a multi-centre setting and evaluated nodal micro-staging using immunohistochemistry (IHC).

Materials and methods
Sub-serosal injection with Patent Blue dye was used in the SLN procedure in 69 patients operated for localized colon cancer in six Dutch hospitals. Each SLN was examined with routine haematoxylin–eosin staining. In tumour-negative SLNs, we performed CK7/8 or 18 IHC.

Results
The procedure was successful in 67 of 69 patients (97%). The SLN was negative in 43 patients. In three cases, it was false negative, resulting in a negative predictive value of 93% and an accuracy of 96%. In 24 of 27 patients with lymph node metastases in a successful SLN procedure, the SLN was positive (sensitivity 89%). In 15 patients, the SLN was the only positive node (21%). In nine patients, we only found micrometastases or isolated tumour cells, resulting in 18% upstaging. Aberrant lymphatic drainage was seen in three patients (4%).

Conclusion
The SLN procedure in localized colon carcinoma is reliable in a multi-centre setting. It is helpful to identify patients who would be classified as stage II with conventional staging (18%) and who might benefit from adjuvant treatment.

]. This study presents the results of the SLN procedure in six Dutch hospitals. The primary aim of this study is to test the accuracy and sensitivity of the SLN procedure in a multi-centre setting. Furthermore, we looked at upstaging and possible aberrant lymphatic drainage.

Materials and methods
This study was performed between May 2002 and May 2005 in five teaching hospitals and one university hospital. All procedures were supervised by one of the coordinating surgeons (Plukker, Braat). Only patients with histologically proven primary colon carcinoma were included in the study. Patients with distant metastases or gross lymph node involvement as shown by pre-operative examinations or palpation during surgery were excluded. The procedure was only performed when one of the study coordinators was available for supervision (Plukker, Braat, Kelder). The study was approved by the local scientific ethics committee, and all patients had given informed consent. Patients with rectal cancer were excluded from the study.

]. Upstaging was defined as the presence of micrometastases or isolated tumour cells after immunohistochemistry (IHC) in patients with a negative lymph node status after H&E.

]. Prospective studies are needed to evaluate the potential benefit of systemic chemotherapy in patients with these micrometastases. A reliable SLN procedure might facilitate this intensive pathological examination by allowing focussed examination of only the SLN and thereby aid in a better patient selection for adjuvant therapy in the future.
