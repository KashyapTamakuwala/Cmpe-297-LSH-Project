Certain nuclear morphometric features measured in breast tumor tissue have been shown to predict the prognosis of breast cancer patients. However, the application of these features to predicting risk of breast cancer development has received little attention. We conducted a case-control study to evaluate nuclear morphometric features in benign breast tissue in association with subsequent breast cancer risk. The study was nested within a cohort of 4,888 women with a histopathologic diagnosis of benign breast disease (BBD) and involved 61 cases and 71 controls, amongst whom there were 53 matched case-control sets. Conditional logistic regression models were fitted to assess various measurements of nuclear size and nuclear shape factors in relation to subsequent breast cancer risk. In multivariate analysis, subsequent breast cancer risk was positively associated with a nuclear shape factor that takes the shortest nuclear axis and the longest nuclear axis into consideration simultaneously (highest quartile versus lowest 3 quartiles: odds ratio = 3.07, 95% confidence limits = 1.61, 5.84). In contrast, there was no alteration in subsequent breast cancer risk in association with nuclear size features and other shape factors. In conclusion, our study results suggest that the shape factor that takes both the shortest nuclear axis and the longest nuclear axis into consideration might be of value to predict subsequent development of breast cancer among women with BBD.

] observed that normal breast tissue or usual ductal hyperplasia harbored nuclear morphometric changes that might be used to predict subsequent development of breast cancer. In the study reported here, we conducted a nested case-control study to evaluate whether nuclear morphometric features as evaluated in tissue sections of BBD may be related to the risk of subsequent breast cancer among patients with BBD.

Methods
Study population

19
]. Recruitment took place between 1980 and 1985, and study subjects were followed actively until 1988. Eligibility for the study was restricted to women with no history of breast cancer (in situ or invasive). The NBSS was approved by the appropriate Institutional Review Boards, and the study described here involved the analysis of material and data from that study in accordance with the approved study design. Informed consent was obtained from all study participants.

Diagnosis of BBD
In the NBSS, women who had clinical or radiologic evidence of breast lesion underwent either a needle aspiration or a biopsy. Diagnosis of BBD was performed by a reference pathologist. Our study was restricted to women who had no evidence of either in situ or invasive breast cancer on their initial surgical biopsy. Women with a history of BBD were not excluded from the analyses. During the follow-up period, we identified 4,888 women with a histopathologic diagnosis of BBD, who were followed up for the subsequent development of breast cancer.

Selection of cases and controls
18
19
]. The dates of the linkages varied by province, ranging from late 1988 to early 1991. A total of 16 subjects with ductal carcinoma in situ and 76 subjects with invasive carcinoma were ascertained among the cohort of women with BBD. Potential control subjects were women with BBD who had not developed breast cancer (but were alive at) by the date of diagnosis of the corresponding case subject. Five controls were selected randomly (with replacement) for each case from those non-cases available within strata defined by screening center, NBSS study arm, year of birth (if possible to the nearest year, and mostly within 2 years), and age at diagnosis of BBD. For the study reported here, 61 case subjects and 71 control subjects (including 53 matched case-control sets) were included.

Questionnaire
Upon enrollment in the NBSS, all participants completed a questionnaire that sought information on demographic characteristics and risk factors for breast cancer, including menstrual and reproductive histories and family history of breast cancer.

Morphometry
20
]. Mean and standard deviation of nuclear area, perimeter, diameter, shortest axis, longest axis, and axis ratio were calculated, as well as different shape factors. The shape factors were calculated by the following formulas: Form_AR = (1/4) * pi * longest axis * shortest axis; Form_PE = 4 * pi * area/(perimeter squared); Form_NCI = perimeter/sqrt (area); Contour ratio = perimeter squared/4 * pi * area; and Roundness = perimeter/(2*sqrt (pi * area)). All morphometric assessments were performed by one observer without knowledge of patient outcome.

Discussion
We found that breast cancer risk in women with BBD was positively associated with the shape factor Form_AR, a measurement that takes the shortest nuclear axis and the longest nuclear axis into consideration simultaneously. In contrast, there was no alteration in risk in association with nuclear area, SD of nuclear area, nuclear perimeter, nuclear diameter, shortest nuclear axis, longest nuclear axis, and other shape factors. Although subjects with hyperplasia had greater measures of Form_AR than did subjects without hyperplasia, we adjusted for hyperplasia, suggesting that the association with Form_AR is independent of that due to the presence of hyperplasia.

]. That study found positive associations for mean nuclear area, nuclear diameter, nuclear perimeter, and the longest nuclear axis, but no associations for SD of the nuclear area and the shortest nuclear axis; shape factors were not evaluated. However, potential confounding factors were not controlled for. In contrast to these findings, nuclear size features were not associated with risk in the present study, which may perhaps be explained by differences in tissue processing procedures.
Our case-control study was nested in a cohort of patients with histopathologically confirmed BBD and our findings are likely to be internally valid. Biased measurement of the study exposures was not likely a source of error, given that the morphometric features were assessed without knowledge of the patient outcome status. Our study power, however, was limited by the relatively small sample size, due to which we were not able to evaluate modifying effects by well-documented risk factors of breast cancer. Moreover, residual confounding might still exist, although to minimize confounding we controlled for menstrual and reproductive history, exogenous estrogen use, body mass index, and family history of breast cancer in multivariate analyses.
In conclusion, our study results suggest that the shape factor that takes both shortest nuclear axis and longest nuclear axis into consideration might be of value to predict subsequent development of breast cancer among patients with BBD. Given the limitations of our study, larger studies are warranted to confirm our study results.


We are indebted to the study participants for their dedication and commitment.
