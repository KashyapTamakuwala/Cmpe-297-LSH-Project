Objective
There is no information on the duration of absence of depressed Dutch workers. The aim of this study was to determine the duration of sickness absence due to depressive symptoms in the working population.

Methods
n
 = 9,910) starting between April 2002 and November 2005 diagnosed as depression were selected. For these episodes, Kaplan–Meier survival curves were computed.

Results
The mean (and median) duration of sickness absence due to depressive symptoms was 200 (179) days in men and 213 (201) days in women. In both sexes, older employees had longer absence durations. Depressive symptoms had an estimated rate of chronicity (1 year of absence) of 24%. Employees in educational and public services (232 days in men and 242 days in women), commercial services (213 days in men and 219 days in women) and health care (212 days in men and 214 days in women) had the longest mean duration of absence with depressive symptoms. Men in the industrial sector (189 days) had the shortest absence periods. Employees in large sized companies (188 days in men and 208 days in women) had shorter absence episodes as compared to companies with less than 75 employees (214 days in men and 226 days in women).

Conclusions
Workers with depressive symptoms were absent for a long time. Explanations for the long duration are discussed. It is recommended to develop and apply tools for recognizing employees at risk for chronic depression.

). The results of international studies are not comparable to the Dutch situation, because of differences in social legislation and sickness absence regulations.
As it is very likely that the results of international studies are not comparable to the Dutch situation, the aims of this study were: (a) to investigate the mean (and median) duration of absenteeism due to depressive symptoms in the Dutch working population by sector and company size, and (b) to investigate gender and age influences on the mean (median) duration of absenteeism due to depressive symptoms.

Methods
Data
The prevention, supervision and medical examination of sickness absence is a task of the employer for which he can choose to engage an occupational health department. ArboNed (the second largest occupational health department in the Netherlands) employs an absenteeism registration system for their affiliated companies. We register sickness absence and its causes in about 15% of the total Dutch working population. In our population, commercial services are over-represented (57% vs. 41%) and non-commercial services (e.g. health care, civil servants) are under-represented (17% vs. 34%) as compared to the total working population in the Netherlands.
All absence periods that started between April 2002 and November 2005, and were diagnosed as depression were selected from the registration system. Absence periods were encoded as depression by the occupational physician when symptoms of depressed mood (such as feelings of profound sadness or emptiness) and/or reduced interest in activities that used to be enjoyed lasted for at least two weeks in combination with 3 or more of the following symptoms: decreased energy, decreased motivation, appetite changes, disturbed sleep pattern, agitation or inhibition, guilt feelings, low sense of self-worth, impaired concentration, or self-destructive thoughts. The symptoms must be accompanied by evident suffering and adverse effects on personal as well as social functioning.

 < 0.01). The company size in which the employee worked was divided into four categories: <75 employees, 75–500 employees, 500–5,000 employees and >5,000 employees. In 95% of cases the company size was known. The companies were categorized into the following sectors (mean age ± standard deviation): construction industry (40.2 ± 10.2), health care (39.6 ± 10.1), trade (38.1 ± 10.3), catering industry (37.5 ± 10.0), industry (40.9 ± 9.8), education and public sector (43.9 ± 9.9), transportation and communication (41.0 ± 9.7), commercial services (38.6 ± 9.9), Other/unknown (39.9 ± 9.9). In 72% of cases the sector was known.

Absence duration

. Absence periods of 365 or more calendar days were considered to reach this limit, and therefore the maximal duration of an absence episode was 365 days.
Absence duration was not corrected for part-time return to work, unless mentioned otherwise. When the number of absence days is corrected for part-time return to work, this is done by dividing the number of absence days by 1/reintegration percentage. For example, when the employee returns to work for 50% the number of absence days is divided by 2.

) calculates the risk set at every point in time where at least one recovery occurred. The risk set also includes episodes that are censored at this point in time. A censored episode contains the information that there was no return to work or reaching the one-year absence limit at the end of the study period or the dismissal date. The survival functions were plotted using life tables. The mean number of absence days corrected for part-time return to work in the different groups was compared using analysis of variance.
If the main effect was significant, the Tukey post hoc test was performed in order to determine which groups differed from each other.

In all age categories, women with depressive symptoms were absent longer than men. Elderly employees had a longer duration of absence and a higher risk of reaching disability. Employees in companies with less than 75 employees were absent for a longer period than employees working in large sized companies. Employees in the educational and public sector had the longest absence duration, followed by employees in commercial services and health care. Men working in the industrial sector had the shortest duration of absence due to depressive symptoms.

 even found longer absence durations for men with psychiatric disorders as compared to women. They reported about neurosis, and we investigated depressive symptoms, which might explain part of the difference.

 reported that the longer duration of absence among men could be explained by gender differences in co-morbidity with alcohol problems and other psychiatric disorders. They also mentioned gender differences in seeking health care, diagnostic procedures and treatment of psychiatric disorders. The social consequences of having a psychiatric disorder might be worse for men than for women, leading to under-reporting among men. Men might postpone the use of health care and get into a poorer mental condition. As a consequence, they need a longer period of recovery and are absent longer from work. Gender differences in the (assessment of) severity of psychiatric problems might also explain the different duration of sick-leave. However, if these mechanisms do play a role in our study, they are more unfavourable to depressed women than to depressed men.
2003
) reported that depressed women returned to work more often than men, rather than leaving employment. They defined the end of the absence period as returning to work either part-time or fulltime. In our study men returned more often to work than women. We regarded fulltime return to work as the end of an absence period, because we did not have the exact dates of part-time return to work. It is possible that women returned more often to work part-time than men.

1996
) we found that men in all age groups, especially in the youngest age groups, had fewer days of sick-leave than women in the corresponding age group. Further study is necessary to investigate these gender differences by age.
In accordance with our third hypothesis (H3), the periods of absence due to depressive symptoms were shorter in large-scale companies than in smaller ones. The reintegration percentage is higher in large companies, resulting in a lower number of absence days. Probably, large companies have more opportunities for part-time return to work. Moreover, large companies have structured protocols as to how to deal with long-term absence from work. In the transportation and communications sectors, part-time return to work was most often observed. In our sample, these are mostly large companies in the postal and telecommunications sector, offering more reintegration possibilities. Although blue-collar workers generally have higher sickness absence than white-collar workers, depressed employees in industrial settings had shorter absence durations. A possible explanation might be that employees in the industrial sector are more susceptible to stigmatization of having mental problems, and return to work earlier. Also, in blue-collar workers, depressive symptoms may more often be masked by or diagnosed as somatic diseases.
2000
). Probably they have more severe depressive symptoms at the moment of sick-leave. Another explanation for their longer absence might be the lesser reintegration opportunities in these sectors. Finally, the mean age of employees in the educational and public sectors was higher than average, and it is known from Dutch national sickness absence surveys that elderly employees are absent longer than younger ones. More research is needed to examine these possible explanations.

) investigated sickness absence due to neurosis with a minimum duration of 15 days until the end of the absence. We investigated absence due to depressive symptoms with a minimum duration of 1 day and maximized at 365 calendar days. In our study, 98% of cases had a minimum absence duration of 15 days. The code depressive symptoms was given in the second or third week of absence, when the absent employee consults the occupational physician.
2003
) studied sick-leaves with depression according to DSM-III-R in psychiatric outpatients. They used exact beginning and ending dates of sick-leaves, resulting in durations ranging from 2 to 374 days and a mean duration of 142 days. At this point, it should be reminded that depressive symptoms were not strictly assessed according to the DSM criteria, limiting the comparability of results.
2003
2003
) reported that the economic consequences of depression (e.g. number of lost work days) were influenced to a greater extent by the presence of medical comorbidity than by symptom severity alone.

2002
) in the general population. They found a chronic course (duration 12 months or more) in 24% of cases. Our survival analysis also indicated a chronic course in 24% of cases. It is important to investigate which employees are at risk for a chronic course.
The duration of a depressive episode in The Netherlands is comparable to other countries, whereas the duration of absenteeism is longer. It could be hypothesized that Dutch employees return to work when they are completely recovered, while in other countries employees start working (part-time) during recovery. We think that differences in social legislation and benefits contribute to these differences. In most other European countries compensation schemes apply to work-related diseases (“risque professional”). In The Netherlands, however, the social insurance system does not take into account the cause of the disease (“risque social”). Moreover, social benefits could have contributed to the relatively long absence duration. Dutch employers are obliged to pay the employee on sick-leave at least 70% of his/her salary. In almost all cases the full salary is paid during the first year of sick-leave, which does not motivate employees to return to their work.

Limitations of the study
Our population is not a random sample from the total Dutch working population, because employers voluntarily engage our occupational health department. Therefore, results are not representative of the whole Dutch working population. However, the considerable sample size and the use of registered, rather than self-rated information on sickness absence, are strong points of this study.

Clinical implications
Because of the risk of chronicity, it is important that occupational physicians recognize depressive symptoms in an early stage of the absence episode

It is recommended to develop and apply tools for recognizing employees at risk for chronic depression

Special attention should be given to employees in educational and public services, commercial services and health care as they are at risk for longer absence duration in case of depressive symptoms.




Study limitations
Diagnosis of depressive symptoms in absent employees may be biased towards absences with a longer duration. Mildly depressed employees, who did not report ill or returned to work before consulting the occupational physician, were not included

Depressive symptoms were not strictly assessed according to DSM criteria, limiting the comparability to other studies

Our absence registration system does not account for comorbidity.
