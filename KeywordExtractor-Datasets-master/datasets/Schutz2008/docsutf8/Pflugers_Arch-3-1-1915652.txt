, a clear up-regulation in Abca1, Abcb1/P-glycoprotein (P-gp), Abcb11/bile salt export pump (Bsep), and Abcc2/multidrug resistance protein (Mrp2) was found, whereas Abcc8 was down-regulated. Up-regulation of Abcc2/Mrp2 was accompanied by enhanced calcein excretion. Aminoguanidine attenuated the effects on transporter expression. Our data indicate that NO, produced locally by renal iNOS, regulates the expression of ABC transporters in vivo. Furthermore, we showed, for the first time, expression and subcellular localization of Abcb11/Bsep in rat kidney.

] and, therefore, play a role in the detoxification of tubule cells. The observed effects of NO on Abcc2/Mrp2 in killifish proximal tubule may be part of the normal progression of cellular events that occur during AKI.
In the present study, we hypothesized that iNOS has a role in the regulation of renal ABC transporters during nephrotoxicity in vivo. An endotoxemia model was used in which rats were exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and the gene expression of 20 ABC transporters was evaluated. In addition, we examined the effect of the iNOS inhibitor, aminoguanidine, to determine whether the change in expression of the renal efflux transporters is caused directly by NO generated by iNOS.

Calibration curves were made with sodium nitrite and sodium nitrate in distilled water. The nitrate recovery was 90–100% over the entire range tested (0–50 μmol/l). The coefficient of variation between the different experiments was less than 5%.

Slices were incubated with the primary antibody in PBS 1% BSA overnight at 4°C. Primary antibody was detected using the Vectastain Elite peroxidase ABC kit (Vector) with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine as substrate. Finally, slices were counterstained with hematoxylin, dehydrated, and mounted in mounting medium. Sections were examined with a confocal laser-scanning microscope (Leica lasertechnik GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany).

]. Indeed, blocking Abcb1/P-gp during endotoxemia leads to further renal damage (Heemskerk, Wouterse, Russel, and Masereeuw, preliminary findings). The renal drug transporters are likely to be under direct influence of NO produced by iNOS, as coadministration of the iNOS inhibitor, aminoguanidine, attenuated the LPS-induced effects on transporter expression. Aminoguanidine treatment results in decreased NO production and, subsequently, reduced oxidative stress by decelerating the formation of peroxynitrite. Under these conditions, less toxic metabolites may be produced, explaining the restoration in transporter expression and reversal of proximal tubular damage.

A down-regulation of ABC transporters, as observed for Abcc8/Sur1 and initially also for Abcb4, may be explained by the different functions of these ABC members in the kidney.

, a clear up-regulation in Abca1, Abcb1/P-gp, Abcb11/Bsep, and Abcc2/Mrp2 was found, whereas Abcc8/Sur1 was down-regulated. Abcb4 and Abcc4/Mrp4 show a differential pattern during the course of endotoxemia. The renal drug transporters are likely to be under direct influence of NO produced by iNOS, as coadministration of the iNOS inhibitor, aminoguanidine, attenuated the LPS-induced effects on their expression. Apparently, an up-regulation of important efflux pumps diminishes the renal accumulation of toxic compounds and attenuates further proximal tubular damage during endotoxemia.
