The present study examined whether parental problem drinking affected parenting (i.e., behavioral control, support, rule-setting, alcohol-specific behavioral control), and whether parental problem drinking and parenting affected subsequent adolescent alcohol use over time. A total of 428 families, consisting of both parents and two adolescents (mean age 13.4 and 15.2 years at Time 1) participated in a three-wave longitudinal study with annual waves. A series of path analyses were conducted using a structural equation modeling program (Mplus). Results demonstrated that, unexpectedly, parental problem drinking was in general not associated with parenting. For the younger adolescents, higher levels of both parenting and parental problem drinking were related to lower engagement in drinking over time. This implies that shared environment factors (parenting and modeling effects) influence the development of alcohol use in young adolescents. When adolescents grow older, and move out of the initiation phase, their drinking behavior may be more affected by other factors, such as genetic susceptibility, and peer drinking.

A similar process might be at work regarding alcohol-specific socialization, suggesting that parents with alcohol problems may engage less frequently in alcohol-specific socialization, and as such provide fewer alcohol-specific rules, are more permissive towards alcohol use and exert less alcohol-specific control.

Methods
Participants and recruitment

). A total of 428 Dutch families, consisting of mother, father, and two adolescent children, participated in our study in the first wave (2002–2003). Families were included when the parents were married or living together, and when all family members were biologically related. Families with twins, or with mentally or physically disabled offspring were excluded. Numbers of drop-outs were extremely low in the second (2003–2004) and third wave (2004–2005), with 416 (97%) and 404 (94%) participating families, respectively.

Procedure
The families were visited at home by a trained interviewer. In his or her presence all four family members individually filled out an extensive questionnaire, which took about 2 h to complete. The participants were not allowed to consult each other or to discuss the answers. When all family members had completed the questionnaire, each family received 30 € (39 $). In addition, after completion of the first three waves of the project, 5 traveler cheques of 1,000 € (1,300 $) each were raffled among all participating families. Approval was obtained from the Central Committee on Research Involving Human Subjects on collecting the data.

Measure
Self-reports were used to measure parental problem drinking and adolescent alcohol use. The four parenting practices were based on adolescents’ reports, reflecting how they perceived their parents’ behaviors. The questions regarding the parenting variables were asked in such a way that the adolescents were able to discriminate between the parenting practices of their mothers and fathers.

) tapping several aspects of emotional and instrumental support. Examples of items were ‘My mother shows me that she loves me’ and ‘My father supports me in what I do’. The adolescents had to answer 12 items on a scale from 1 ‘absolutely untrue’ to 5 ‘absolutely true’. The amount of support was the mean score on 12 items. Cronbach’s alpha coefficients were between .76 and .88 across the three waves.

Alcohol-specific parenting

) developed a 10-item scale to measure the degree to which parents permit their children to consume alcohol. Examples of items were: ‘I am allowed to drink alcoholic consumptions when my mother/father is at home’ and ‘I am allowed to drink alcohol on weekdays’. Participants had to respond on a 5-point scale that ranged from 1 ‘completely applicable’ to 5 ‘not applicable at all’. The internal consistency was high, with Cronbach’s alphas between .89 and .92 over the three waves.

) was adapted to measure behavioral control aimed at affecting adolescents’ alcohol consumption. Examples of the 5 items were ‘Do you need your mother’s permission to drink alcohol on weekdays?’ and ‘Does your mother want to know whether your friends drink alcohol?’. As in the original scale, the response categories ranged from 1 ‘never’ to 5 ‘always’. Cronbach’s alpha coefficients were between .74 and .88 across the three waves.

). With respect to problem drinking, the possibility of enhancing resiliency in children and adolescents, by protecting against possible harmful influences from one parent by a strong relationship with the other parent, siblings, or peers, should be a topic of examination in future research. In addition, with regard to the persons in our sample, being part of a stable, nuclear family that consists of two biological parents with two or more children living together may be protective in itself.
Our findings do not imply that problem drinking has no effect on personal cognition or functioning, but suggest that parents are able to regulate their problem behavior with regard to their children and parenting practices. However, parental problem drinking may affect the way in which parents handle alcohol use within the family. Parents with more alcohol-related problems are not more permissive than parents who do not have these problems. Maintaining the set rules by means of alcohol-specific behavioral control, however, does appear to be a problem.

). As such, shared environmental factors, such as parenting and parental modeling, affect alcohol consumption in young adolescence. Drinking in later adolescence may be related to other, non-shared factors, such as genes and peer drinking. Accordingly, future research should apply a longitudinal, behavioral genetic design, preferably examining the different stages of adolescent drinking (initiation, frequency of consumption, drinking to intoxication) in order to partial out the different effects of genetic and environmental factors.

). However, parents did not adjust their levels of permissiveness in response to adolescent alcohol use. Perhaps rule-setting is more stable over time, and is not affected by fluctuations in adolescent alcohol use. The application of those rules, however, by means of exerting control, was influenced by the levels of alcohol that adolescents consumed. Since our study is one of the first to examine reciprocal effects between adolescent drinking and parental factors, more research on this topic is warranted.

Limitations

) for an elaborated discussion on this topic.
Taking these limitations into account, this study is the first to disentangle the prospective relations between parental alcohol-related problems, parenting, and adolescent alcohol use in a community sample using multi-informant data. The results show that parental problem drinking does not substantially and systematically affect parenting, and that parenting influences adolescent alcohol use, but only up to the age of about 14 years. This implies that shared environment factors (e.g., parenting and modeling effects) influence the development of alcohol use in young adolescents. When adolescents grow older, and move out of the initiation phase, their drinking behavior may be more affected by other factors, such as genetic susceptibility and peer drinking.
