Conclusion
Several small but significant improvements in QoL were observed with increasing attendance to the walking program. No effect of vitamin B supplementation was observed.

]. Aspects of QoL were measured as a secondary outcome. In the present paper, the effectiveness of 1 year moderate intensity walking (two sessions of 60 min per week) and daily vitamin supplementation (5 mg folate, 50 mg vitamin B6 and 0.4 mg B12) on both overall QoL and it’s health-related components is examined in community dwelling older adults with MCI. We hypothesize that 1 year moderate intensity walking benefits QoL. Concerning the effect of vitamin supplementation, this paper should be considered as explorative.

Exercise intervention

] aimed at improving cardiovascular endurance. Therefore, duration and intensity of the walking exercises increased gradually during the program. Sessions took place outdoor in municipal parks. Subjects not assigned to the WP participated in a placebo activity program (PAP) with the same frequency, session duration and program duration. However, the PAP consisted of low intensity exercise, such as light range of motion movements and stretching. Sessions were divided into five themes: relaxation, activities of daily living, balance, flexibility, posture and a combination of all. For each theme three sessions were developed and the entire series of 18 sessions was repeated during the intervention period. The PAP was carried out in community centers. Both programs were supervised by qualified and trained instructors. Attendance to both programs was assessed by the percentage of attended sessions.

Vitamin supplementation (FA/B12/B6)
Subjects in the vitamin supplementation group took one pill containing 5 mg vitamin B11 (Folic Acid), 0.4 mg vitamin B12 (Cyanocobalamin) and 50 mg vitamin B6 (Pyridoxine-hydrochloride) daily during 1 year. This vitamin supplement is available on prescription in The Netherlands. Subjects randomized to the control group took an identically looking placebo pill. The pills were packed in blister packs for 1 week, which were labeled for each day of the week. Compliance with the vitamin supplementation was verified by pill counts in returned blister packs during the intervention.

For all analyses, regression coefficients and 95% confidence intervals for the adjusted models were reported, with the regression coefficients directly indicating the difference in QoL ratings between the WP and the PAP or the FA/B12/B6-supplementation versus placebo supplementation.

Discussion
No positive main effect of walking or daily FA/B6/B12 supplementation was observed on QoL in community-dwelling adults with MCI. However, ratings of overall QoL (i.e., feelings of belonging, positive affect) and the mental component of health-related QoL improved slightly with increasing attendance to the walking program. In a subgroup that attended at least 75% of the sessions, a beneficial effect of the walking program was observed on positive affect and self esteem.

] including 36 studies, a small positive effect of exercise was observed on wellbeing in healthy older adults. In that meta-analysis four components of wellbeing were considered, including aspects that were also measured in the FACT-study, such as positive and negative affect, perception of physical fitness and physical symptoms.
32
]. However, adherers rated their mental health-related QoL at baseline significantly better than non-adherers. The difference was three points, which approximately equaled a difference of 5%. The possibility exists that subjects with lower mental health-related QoL were inclined to attend less sessions. Nevertheless, it is not likely that this biased our results, because non-adherers and drop-outs from the exercise programs were included in the modified intention to treat analyses. In future studies in subjects with cognitive decline, session attendance may be improved by informing subjects extensively about the study aims and the consequences of participation. Moreover, if possible with respect to logistic and financial issues, we advice to schedule time and staff for the close personal follow-up of temporary drop-outs.

]. However, in the present study, no interaction between the walking program and baseline physical activity level was observed (results not presented), indicating that inactive participants did not benefit more from the WP than active participants. Therefore, it is not likely that baseline physical activity level was a main cause of the lack of main effects.

]. Thus, the presence of the low intensity placebo activity program in our study may have contributed towards the lack of between group differences.
Nevertheless, several outcomes improved with increasing attendance to the walking program. In the per protocol analyses a beneficial effect was observed on positive affect. Self esteem also tended to improve. However, observed differences were small and approximated 5% differences from baseline QoL ratings. As a rule of thumb, a minimal change of 5% has been mentioned to signify clinical relevance. To obtain a change of 5% by increasing attendance, the required increase in attendance would be 62% for D-QoL-belonging and 94% for D-QoL-positive affect and the SF12-MCS. Therefore, it can be questioned whether the observed effects are clinically relevant.

To conclude, the walking program and vitamin B supplementation were not effective in improving QoL in community-dwelling older adults with MCI within 1 year. However, increasing attendance to moderate intensity physical activity may benefit certain aspects of QoL.
