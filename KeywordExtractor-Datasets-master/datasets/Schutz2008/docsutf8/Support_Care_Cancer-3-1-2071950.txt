Introduction
Previous studies have shown that most people prefer to die at their own home. We investigated whether physicians or bereaved relatives in retrospect differently appreciate the dying of patients in an institution or at home.

Materials and methods
Of 128 patients with incurable cancer who were followed in the last phase of their lives, 103 passed away during follow-up. After death, physicians filled out a written questionnaire for 102 of these patients, and 63 bereaved relatives were personally interviewed.

Results
Of 103 patients, 49 died in an institution (mostly a hospital), and 54 died at home (or in two cases in a home-like situation). Patients who had been living with a partner relatively often died at home. Bereaved relatives knew of the patient’s wish to die at home in 25 out of 63 cases; 20 of these patients actually died at home. Thirty-one patients had no known preference concerning their place of dying. Most symptoms and the care provided to address them were equally prevalent in patients dying in an institution and patients dying at home. Bereaved relatives were in general quite satisfied about the provision of medical and nursing care in both settings.

Conclusion
We conclude that most patients’ preferences concerning the place of dying can be met. In about half of all cases, patients do not seem to have a clear preference concerning their place of dying, which is apparently not a major concern for many people. We found no indication that dying in an institution or at home involves major differences in the process and quality of dying.

Little is known about the experiences of dying patients and their caregivers in different health care settings. We investigated to what extent dying in an institution or at home involves differences in care and its appreciation by physicians and bereaved relatives.

]. Obviously, the number of cases in our study was limited, and we did not assess all possibly relevant factors, which precludes firm conclusions on determinants of the place of dying. However, whereas access to the available public end-of-life care services, both institutional and home-based, is virtually unlimited in The Netherlands and financially covered by either private or public insurance, care needs of patients are probably a predominant factor.
27

].
It is remarkable that a substantial number of patients in our study did not have a clear preference concerning their place of dying. Obviously, we only have information about the preferences that patients had discussed with their interviewed relative. Patients may also have had wishes that relatives were not aware of. Nevertheless, the data in our study suggest that the place of dying is not a great concern for a substantial number of terminally ill cancer patients in The Netherlands.
28

]. Medical decision-making may also be less complex or controversial for patients who die at home.
34
35
]. In contrast, bedsores were more common at home.
36
]. Further, most relatives were closely involved and appreciated their personal involvement very much, both for patients who died in an institution and patients who died at home. Nevertheless, caring for a dying relative often affected their own social life, especially when dying occurred at home, and took a lot of energy.
37
]. This is also true for physicians’ assessment of their patients’ condition. Secondly, our group of patients is probably not representative for all patients dying from one of the five major types of cancer because patients with a very poor health status and patients who died shortly after the diagnosis of incurable cancer were not included in the cohort study upon which the data collection for this study was based. Moreover, data from bereaved relatives could only be obtained for 61% of all patients, which may have resulted in an overestimation of the degree of satisfaction of relatives. The fact that patients of whom no bereaved relative participated in the study had a shorter disease duration at inclusion than other patients suggests that a rapidly progressive disease process makes it more difficult for bereaved relatives to talk about the last phase of life of the patient.
In summary, we did not find major differences in the process and quality of dying between institutional settings and the home setting. Most patients with clear preferences concerning their place of dying were able to die at their preferred place. In about half of all cases, relatives were not aware of any preference of the patient concerning the place of dying, which is apparently not a major concern for many people. We conclude that the current situation in The Netherlands, in which the place of dying is mainly determined by the availability of informal caregivers at home and the care needs of the patient, involves no major threats to the process and quality of dying.


Acknowledgment
We are very grateful to the patients and their relatives who participated in this study, to the medical doctors who invited the patients to participate and filled out questionnaires, and to the oncology nurses who were very supportive during the data collection. The study was supported by the Dutch Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport, the Center for Development of Palliative Care in Rotterdam, The Netherlands, and the Comprehensive Cancer Center South in Eindhoven, The Netherlands.
