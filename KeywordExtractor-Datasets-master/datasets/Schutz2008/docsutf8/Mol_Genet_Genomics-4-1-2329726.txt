Escherichia coli
 strains are the major cause of urinary tract infections in humans. Such strains can be divided into virulent, UPEC strains causing symptomatic infections, and asymptomatic, commensal-like strains causing asymptomatic bacteriuria, ABU. The best-characterized ABU strain is strain 83972. Global gene expression profiling of strain 83972 has been carried out under seven different sets of environmental conditions ranging from laboratory minimal medium to human bladders. The data reveal highly specific gene expression responses to different conditions. A number of potential fitness factors for the human urinary tract could be identified. Also, presence/absence data of the gene expression was used as an adaptive genomics tool to model the gene pool of 83972 using primarily UPEC strain CFT073 as a scaffold. In our analysis, 96% of the transcripts filtered present in strain 83972 can be found in CFT073, and genes on six of the seven pathogenicity islands were expressed in 83972. Despite the very different patient symptom profiles, the two strains seem to be very similar. Genes expressed in CFT073 but not in 83972 were identified and can be considered as virulence factor candidates. Strain 83972 is a deconstructed pathogen rather than a commensal strain that has acquired fitness properties.

Closeness to CFT073
Given the different growth conditions analysed, it is not unrealistic to assume that most genes present in strain 83972 would be expressed, to some extent, under at least one of these seven different conditions/environments, i.e. growth in liquid and on solid media; during exponential phase, in biofilm and during colony-forming conditions; in different growth media (human urine and minimal lab medium); as well as in vivo in three different individuals.

Discussion
E. coli
2004
E. coli
 83972 is an example of an organism that has adapted to a commensal-like existence through gene deletions and point mutations. Using primarily the CFT073 as a scaffold, we used presence/absence data from seven sets of different gene expression profiles (in total 21 microarrays) to model the gene pool of strain 83972. Given the limitations of the approach, i.e. genes not present on the employed chip have been ignored, a substantial body of information was gathered concerning the genomic content of the strain. As it turned out the strain was highly similar to CFT073; 96% (3,959) of the genes found to be expressed on the employed microarray by 83972 are also found in CFT073, and genes on six of the seven pathogenicity islands of CFT073 were expressed by 83972; furthermore, CFT073 genes not found in any other UPEC isolate were expressed by 83972. An estimated ∼900 CFT073 genes are not expressed by 83972. Arguably, in the light of the difference in patient symptoms invoked by encounters with the two strains, this list represents virulence gene candidates.

 genes were not expressed in the ABU strain. These stand out as potential virulence candidates together with a number of uncharacterised genes encoding hypothetical proteins.
Thus from the analyses performed here we can make predictions about several gene categories such as potential virulence genes, fitness genes and “household-class” genes. It is also noteworthy that the information reported herein complements a potential genome sequence of strain 83972. Whole genome sequencing can identify the presence of genes but is unable to reveal if they are transcribed. Genes can be silenced not only due to lesions in the actual gene and its promoter but also due to mutations of genes encoding regulatory factors. The methodology employed in the present work reveals the active genome of strain 83972.
ABU strain 83972 is closely related to fully virulent uropathogenic strains. All evidences suggest that the strain is a deconstructed pathogen. This study dispels the commonly held idea that ABU strains are commensals that have picked up niche-adaptation genes by horizontal gene transfer. Rather, strain 83972 was originally a true pathogenic strain that has lost whole or part of operons that contribute to virulence.
