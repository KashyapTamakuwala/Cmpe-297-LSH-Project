 by preventing breakdown), affect hPepT1 function. The dietary phosphodiesterase inhibitors caffeine and theophylline and the orally-delivered drug pentoxifylline all inhibit dipeptide uptake across the brush-border membrane of human intestinal epithelial Caco-2 cell monolayers. This inhibition is not a direct effect on hPepT1 but rather is indirect through inhibition of NHE3.

Biotrak cAMP enzyme immunoassay was from GE Healthcare (Chalfont St. Giles, UK). 2′,7′-Bis(2-carboxyethyl-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein) acetoxymethyl ester (BCECF-AM) was from Invitrogen (Paisley, UK). Transwell polycarbonate filters were from Corning (Schiphol-Rijk, The Netherlands). S1611 was obtained from H.J. Lang (Aventis Pharma Deutschland GmbH, Frankfurt/Main, Germany). Forskolin, phosphodiesterase inhibitors, cell culture media and supplements were from Sigma-Aldrich (Poole, UK).

Uptake was measured at apical pH 5.5 or pH 6.5 (10 mM MES, adjusted to the correct pH by Tris) with the basolateral solution being pH 7.4 (10 mM HEPES, adjusted to the correct pH by Tris) in all experiments. Uptake was measured over 15 min (37 °C) at the end of which the monolayers were rinsed thoroughly (in 3 × 500 ml, ice-cold, pH 7.4 Krebs' solution). Various compounds were added to the buffers for the duration of uptake (see figure legends for details). Cell monolayer-associated radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting.

C shows that when Caco-2 cell monolayers were incubated with PACAP (5 nM) in the basolateral solution for the duration of uptake, Gly–Sar uptake was reduced. Incubation of the cells with both PACAP and IBMX resulted in a reduction in uptake which was not significantly different from the uptake in the presence of either PACAP or IBMX alone suggesting IBMX, like PACAP, is inhibiting the NHE3-dependent component of Gly–Sar uptake.
