]. Therefore, we investigated the effect of reconstituted HDL (rHDL) on endothelial function measured both acutely (4 h after infusion) and 7 days after infusion in type 2 diabetes patients. Control volunteers were measured only at baseline and 4 h after infusion.

) were enrolled. Inclusion criteria for type 2 diabetes patients were: (1) fasting glucose >7.0 mmol/l; (2) no insulin therapy; and (3) triacylglycerol and LDL-cholesterol levels <2.0 and <3.5 mmol/l, respectively. Matched control individuals were volunteers who were recruited via advertisements. The presence of macrovascular disease (ECG abnormalities, abnormal ankle–brachial index or a history of cardiovascular events) served as exclusion criteria. Female participants were postmenopausal and not using hormone replacement therapy. The study protocol was performed at least 4 weeks after discontinuation of vasoactive medication, including ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. None of the patients or control volunteers used lipid-lowering medication. The Internal Review Board of the Academic Medical Center approved the study and all individuals gave written informed consent.

], and thus far the lack of selective and potent HDL-increasing drugs has limited the success of the HDL-cholesterol increase concept. Our reported beneficial effects of ApoA-I infusion may lend further support to the development of ApoA-I-increasing strategies, also for patients with type 2 diabetes.
