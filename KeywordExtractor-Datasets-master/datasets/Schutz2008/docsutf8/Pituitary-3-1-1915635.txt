Objective
Improvement of visual field defects continues even years after the initial surgical treatment. Because this process of continuing improvement has not been documented for visual acuity, we audited our data to explore the pattern of recovery of visual acuity until 1 year after transsphenoidal surgery for non-functioning pituitary macroadenoma.

Design
Retrospective follow-up study.

Patients
Forty-three patients (mean age 56 ± 14 years), treated by transsphenoidal surgery for non-functioning pituitary macroadenoma, were included in this analysis.

This is, however, clinically relevant, since improvement of minor visual field defects can occur unnoticed, whereas improvement in visual acuity is almost invariably noticed, and can potentially overcome thresholds to previous impairments in daily life. We therefore audited our data to explore the pattern of recovery of visual acuity until 1 year after transsphenoidal surgery for non-functioning pituitary macroadenoma.

Patients and methods
Patient selection
Compression of the optic chiasm on MRI by the pituitary tumor prior to surgery

Transsphenoidal surgery for non-functioning pituitary macroadenoma (diameter > 1 cm) for decompression of the optic chiasm

Assessment of visual acuity at least once before surgery, and at least twice in the first year after surgery

The availability of two postsurgical MR scans, within a time frame of maximal 3 months of the ophtalmological assessments



We did not restrict the inclusion criteria to patients with visual field defects, but also included patients with clear compression of the optic chiasm without decreased visual function, for two reasons. First, we were interested in the pattern of change in visual function prior to surgery. Second, it is, at least theoretically, possible that in patients with compression of the optic chiasm, surgical treatment may decrease visual function. To overcome the potential effect of postoperative tumor-regrowth on visual outcome, patients were excluded from analysis if the 1 year post-operative scans revealed growth of residual tumor.
For complete assessment, we reviewed the patient records of all departments involved in the treatment of NFMA (Endocrinology, Neurosurgery, Ophthalmology). Endocrine (pituitary function) and ophthalmologic data (visual acuity and visual fields) were assessed before surgery, 3 and 12 months after surgery. An MRI was performed before surgery, 3–6 months and 12–15 months after surgery. Transsphenoidal surgery was performed by one of two neurosurgeons

] and was scored for both eyes. Visual fields were assessed by Humphrey perimetry in all patients. Goldman perimetry was used as an additional tool to assess peripheral visual field defects. To increase the reliability of the visual field testing, assessment of the visual fields, and thereby also visual acuity, was preferably performed twice prior to surgical treatment. However, surgical treatment was not delayed due to double ophthalmologic testing in patients with severe impaired visual acuity.

).
In all patients, visual acuity was scored on a scale between 0 and 1.25. Visual field defects were scored semi-quantitative and classified as mild, moderate or severe. Visual field defects were classified as mild, if there were peripheral defects in only one quadrant. Defects were classified as moderate if the upper quadrants were affected, whereas in combined upper and lower quadrant field defects, these were classified as severe.
Growth hormone (GH) deficiency was defined as an insufficient rise in GH levels (absolute value < 3 μg/l) after stimulation during an insulin tolerance test (ITT). When secondary amenorrhoea was present for more than 1 year premenopausal women were defined as LH/FSH deficient. Postmenopausal women were defined as LH/FSH deficient, when gonadotropin levels were below the normal post-menopausal range (LH < 10 U/l, FSH < 30 U/l). In men, LH/FSH deficiency was defined, as a testosterone level below the reference range (8.0 nmol/l). TSH deficiency was defined as a total or free T4 level below the reference range. ACTH deficiency was defined as a basal cortisol level at 8.00 AM of <0.12 μmol/l and/or an insufficient increase in cortisol levels (absolute value < 0.55 μmol/l) after an ITT.

Discussion
The main aims of surgery in non-functioning pituitary macroadenoma are restoration of visual acuity and visual field defects by decompression of the optic chiasm. Nonetheless, our data indicate that there is no necessity for immediate decompression, since postponement of surgery for several weeks did not result in deterioration of visual acuity. Moreover, in this series of 43 patients, we demonstrated a continuing improvement of visual acuity until 1 year after transsphenoidal surgery.

However, they did not demonstrate this same pattern of recovery for visual acuity. This might be due to the relative small number of patients during prolonged follow-up. In the present study we demonstrate that also improvement of visual acuity continued 1 year after surgical treatment.

In conclusion, this study demonstrates that the improvement of visual acuity, after transsphenoidal treatment for non-functioning pituitary macroadenomas, consists of both an early and a delayed phase of recovery. After initial post-surgical recovery, a progressive delayed improvement of visual acuity at least until 1 year after transsphenoidal surgery, is likely to occur.
