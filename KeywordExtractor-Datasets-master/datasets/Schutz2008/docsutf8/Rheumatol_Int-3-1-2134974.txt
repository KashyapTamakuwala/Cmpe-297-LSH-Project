Increasing awareness of the importance of aberrant B cell regulation in autoimmunity has driven the clinical development of novel B cell-directed biologic therapies with the potential to treat a range of autoimmune disorders. The first of these drugs—rituximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody against the B cell-specific surface marker CD20—was recently approved for treating rheumatoid arthritis in patients with an inadequate response to other biologic therapies. The aim of this review is to discuss the potential use of rituximab in the management of other autoimmune disorders. Results from early phase clinical trials indicate that rituximab may provide clinical benefit in systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjögren’s syndrome, vasculitis, and thrombocytopenic purpura. Numerous case reports and several small pilot studies have also been published reporting the use of rituximab in conditions such as myositis, antiphospholipid syndrome, Still’s disease, and multiple sclerosis. In general, the results from these preliminary studies encourage further testing of rituximab therapy in formalized clinical trials. Based on results published to date, it is concluded that rituximab, together with other B cell-directed therapies currently under clinical development, is likely to provide an important new treatment option for a number of these difficult-to-treat autoimmune disorders.

Although patient responses were highly variable and there was a marked placebo effect, a higher proportion of patients in the rituximab group achieved improvement in fatigue (the primary efficacy endpoint) than in the placebo group (48 vs. 20%); this difference was not statistically significant. Significantly greater improvements with rituximab over placebo in the social functioning aspect of the quality of life assessment were also noted.

Rituximab treatment was reported to have been well tolerated.


Conclusions
Recent advances in our understanding of autoimmunity have opened up new avenues for exploring novel targeted therapies in a wide range of diseases. The role of B cells in many autoimmune disorders is now widely accepted, in many cases through the demonstration that B cell depletion using rituximab can often be very effective clinically. The potential utility of rituximab and other B cell-directed therapies is currently being studied in several of these diseases, including SLE, SS, and vasculitis. Although to date most of the findings have been encouraging, a significant proportion of the information derives from case reports and small case series. Together with the lack of randomized controlled trials in most of the diseases discussed in this review, it is likely that there has been a degree of positive reporting bias. Therefore, until large-scale clinical trial data are available, it would be prudent to proceed with caution regarding the use of rituximab outside its approved indications. Although rituximab tolerability was generally reported as favorable in most of the studies covered in this review, the true incidence of associated adverse events (e.g., serious infections, serum sickness-like reactions, and PML) will only become clear when larger numbers of patients have been treated in each disease entity. Important questions also remain regarding the optimal rituximab dosing modalities for each disease (for example, the dose and frequency of treatment, when re-treatment should be considered, and whether to use combination therapies). Nevertheless, based on the information published to date, it seems likely that B cell depletion therapy, using rituximab and—in the future—agents currently under development, will offer an effective new approach for the management of many of these burdensome and difficult-to-treat conditions.
