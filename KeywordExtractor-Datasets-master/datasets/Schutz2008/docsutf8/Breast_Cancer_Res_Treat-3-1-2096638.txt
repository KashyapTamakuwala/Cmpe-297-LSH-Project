 = 0.026). In conclusion, FANCD2 expression is absent in 10–20% of sporadic and BRCA1-related breast cancers, indicating that somatic inactivating (epi)genetic events in FANCD2 may be important in both sporadic and hereditary breast carcinogenesis. FANCD2 is of independent prognostic value in sporadic breast cancer.

Polyclonal rabbit anti-FANCD2 (200 μg/ml) was diluted 1:500 in PBS/1% BSA, and sections were incubated overnight (4°C) in a humidified chamber. Subsequently, sections were incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (EnVision, DAKO) and diaminobenzidin (10 min), counterstained with hematoxylin (20 s), dehydrated, and cover-slipped. Appropriate positive controls were used throughout, and negative controls were obtained by omission of the primary antibodies.

In the regression analysis between the percentages of FANCD2-expressing cells and Ki-67 and Cyclin A, the completely negative FANCD2 cases were excluded. These FANCD2-negative cases had Ki-67 values between 1 and 65 (mean 16%), Cyclin A values between 0 and 50 (mean 10%), and MAI values between 0 and 37 (mean 11), indicating that these cases had (sometimes even high) FANCD2-independent proliferation.

Discussion

It appeared that 19% of sporadic breast cancers completely lacked FANCD2 expression. Yet, these FANCD2-negative cases had high mean Ki-67, Cyclin A, and MAI values, indicating that the low FANCD2 levels in these cases cannot be explained by low proliferation. The fact that these FANCD2-negative cases stained for other proteins makes it quite unlikely that the FANCD2 negativity is due to fixation problems. In the FANCD2-negative cases, FANCD2 inactivation may, in view of its important function, have been a hit in carcinogenesis. BRCA1 germline mutation-related breast cancers showed lack of FANCD2 expression in only 9.5% of cases, which fits with the concept that a major hit in an important pathway (in these cases the BRCA1 germline mutation) is usually not associated with further hits in this pathway. It is yet unclear what the mechanism behind the lack of FANCD2 expression in these cases is. It needs to be further studied whether there are inactivating somatic mutations in these cases or whether promoter methylation plays a role.

]. FANCD2 had prognostic value independent of stage and grade, which can be explained by the fact that proliferation and stage are not strongly correlated, and that grade includes nuclear atypia and tubule formation besides rate of proliferation as measured by mitotic index.
34
], a functional link between p53 and Fancd2 has not been described to explain the association found in the present study, which is likely caused by the fact that p53 mutated and thereby p53 protein accumulated tumors show, in general, higher proliferation and therefore more proliferating FANCD2-expressing cells. The same may also hold for the relation between FANCD2 and EGFR expressions, for which also no functional relationship has been described.
The negative relation between FANCD2 and age can likely be explained by the fact that BRCA1-related patients that have higher FANCD2 expression are younger.
Within the light of the above observations, the question remains why FANCD2 patients do not seem to be predisposed to breast cancer in clinical practice. FA itself is a rare genetic disease where the complementation group D2 constitutes only 1–2% of all FA cases and these patients generally have a more severe clinical course. They may therefore simply not live to get breast cancer in an apparent increased frequency. Our results do not indicate that somatic (epi)genetic changes in FANCD2 are a frequent secondary carcinogenetic event in BRCA1 germline-mutated patients, although this needs to be confirmed in a larger study group.
In conclusion, FANCD2 expression is absent in 10–20% of sporadic and BRCA1-related breast cancers, indicating that somatic inactivating (epi)genetic events in FANCD2 may be important in both sporadic and hereditary breast carcinogenesis. FANCD2 is of independent prognostic value in sporadic breast cancer.
