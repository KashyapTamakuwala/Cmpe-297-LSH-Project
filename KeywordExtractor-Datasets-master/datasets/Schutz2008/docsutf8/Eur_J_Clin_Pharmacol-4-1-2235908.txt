Background
The rational prescribing of drugs is an essential skill of medical doctors. Clinical pharmacologists play an important role in the development of these skills by teaching clinical pharmacology and therapeutics (CP&T) to undergraduate medical students. Although the approaches to teaching CP&T have undergone many changes over the last decennia, it is essential that the actual teaching of CP&T continues to be a major part of the undergraduate medical curriculum.

Objectives
The learning objectives of CP&T teaching in terms of developing the therapeutic competencies of undergraduate medical students are described, with an emphasis on therapeutic decision-making. On the basis of current theories of cognitive psychology and medical education, context-learning is presented as an effective approach by which to achieve therapeutic competencies. An example of a CP&T curriculum is presented.

]. Therefore, it is important to improve the undergraduate teaching in CP&T.
In this review, we shall endeavour to indicate the essential aspects of teaching CP&T to undergraduate medical students. To this end, we first describe what is known about the general learning objectives in CP&T that medical students should master before graduation. Subsequently, we focus on an essential (in our opinion) core learning objective: ‘therapeutic decision-making’. We go on to describe how medical students and physicians arrive at a therapeutic decision and discuss the possibilities of teaching medical students rational pharmacotherapy. Finally, we recommend approaches for organising, presenting and assessing CP&T in the undergraduate medical curriculum.

]. Core skills are in many ways similar to core knowledge because knowledge must be learned and used as the medical student develops skill in practicing rational therapeutics. Core attitudes include attitudes about what constitutes valid information, what kind of information is likely to be in error and what new information must be continuously acquired from reliable sources.

]. First, based on the WHO concept of an ‘essential drug list‘, he developed two lists of drugs; one list consisted of approximately 120 essential drugs that students would be expected to know in detail, and a shorter list consisted of drugs that students would be expected to be familiar with but were not required to know in any detail. This list of essential drugs was then examined by the Education Subcommittee of the EACPT. The second approach to defining a core curriculum for CP&T was the disease-based approach. Three types of disease process were defined: (1) 67 diseases that were common and that the student must know how to manage; (2) 158 diseases that were less common but that students must be able to diagnose, after which the appropriate therapy could be found in the literature; (3) 36 diseases that were rare but that students should be aware of.
Defining a core curriculum for CP&T as presented by Nierenberg, Walley and Orme is important to defining the shape and boundary of the discipline and may be helpful as part of a medical student's examination. However, in addition to knowledge, physicians must also have prescribing skills in order to prescribe rationally.

]. This study indicated that undergraduate students who used the GGP performed significantly better than students who did not used the GGP. In addition, students not only remembered how to solve old problems, but they could also apply their skills to new problems, a so-called transfer effect.
16
]. Despite the fact that many doctors agree with the importance of these aspects of competence and that many countries have already adopted the CanMEDS roles in their curricula, there is limited information on how these roles can be applied in an international context and in different specialities, such as CP&T. Therefore, before clinical pharmacology as a discipline can adopt the CanMEDS competencies, the core learning objectives as determined in the last decades will have to be translated into the CanMEDS competencies.
In conclusion, in order to improve the competency of future doctors to prescribe effectively and safely, several clinical pharmacologists have attempted to determine what every medical student should master before graduation. A common feature of all of the competencies formulated is that all students must acquire a knowledge of the clinical pharmacology of essential drugs and diseases and must master prescribing skills in order to become competent in the rational prescription of drugs.

Therapeutic decision-making
Although, as described previously, there are many essential therapeutic skills, the final choice of a (drug) treatment for a patient can be looked upon as a core skill in therapeutics. In order to find effective ways to teach our future doctors, it is important to explore how expert doctors arrive at this final therapeutic decision.
17
18
]. Over 500 patient consultations by 25 general practitioners and 25 clinical specialists were observed and recorded. In addition, all doctors were interviewed about their therapeutic reasoning. Based on this study, it became evident that doctors generally based their choice of (drug) treatment on two steps: (1) doctors initially used treatment guidelines or drug formularies as a starting point; (2) this was followed by a verification of the suitability of this treatment for the individual patient and a modification of the choice of treatment if necessary (for example, in case of co-morbidity or co-medication). Moreover, it was also observed that the more experienced physicians knew more standard treatments by heart compared to less experienced physicians.
19

]. This study indicated that when a doctor is confronted with a diagnosis – for example, a patient with both essential hypertension and a renal disorder – he or she immediately thinks of a number of pharmacotherapeutic possibilities, referred to as the ‘evoked set’. Depending on the diagnosis, the ‘evoked set’ consists of 1.7–5 different pharmacotherapeutic options that are influenced by many factors, such as refresher courses, the literature, experience and advertisements from the pharmaceutical industry. The ultimate choice out of the ‘evoked set’ for an individual patient may be either ‘unreasoned’ (routine) or ‘reasoned’ (evaluation of the different options). However, how the final choice of treatment is made is still unknown.
21
22
23
].
In order to verify whether this is the right script for the individual patient, two types of diagnostic reasoning may be used – analytical and non-analytical. Analytical reasoning is characterised as a slow and relatively time-consuming process that is carried out consciously and systematically and, if possible, evidence-based. Less or inexperienced doctors, such as medical students, mostly use this type of reasoning, mainly because they do not possess the ability to call up so-called ‘illness scripts’. In contrast to analytical reasoning, non-analytical reasoning is carried out rapidly and subconsciously and is based on experience and pattern recognition. This type of reasoning is used especially by experienced doctors. However, when an experienced doctor is confronted with a complex patient case, he or she will also use analytical reasoning.

However, in order to validate this hypothetical model, further research should be performed, particularly in terms of how experienced doctors arrive at their choice of treatment. In addition, we need to find out how these experienced doctors differ from less-experienced doctors, such as medical students and interns. The answers to these questions will provide more insight into how we should teach therapeutics to students although it can already be stated that early clinical practice will support the development of treatment scripts by undergraduate medical students.

 for their own learning. It is the student's own responsibility to repair any lack of knowledge or skills discovered during their clinical work and feedback sessions.
Apart from the most extreme form of context-learning, which is the clinical setting, different variations with lower levels of concreteness of the context are possible, varying from role-playing sessions with standardised patients in a simulated practice setting to the solution of written patient problems in small working groups and patient demonstrations during lectures. However, there are many ways to improve the setting, such as by using real case histories instead of written patient problems or through the use of video materials, laboratory test results or roentgenograms.
32
]. These authors described a context-learning programme consisting of weekly-organized, role-playing sessions in the form of consulting hours. The role-playing sessions consist of three phases: consultation, argumentation and feedback. First, a ‘student’ doctor must carry out three therapeutic consultations of 10 min each. Before the start of a consultation, the doctors are given a written patient case. Subsequently, the ‘student’ patient and ‘student’ assessor enter the consultation room, and the doctor has to choose and prescribe the (drug) treatment interactively with the patient. The second phase (argumentation) starts immediately after the consultations. In this phase, the doctor has to substantiate the chosen therapy. Finally, during the third phase, all students sit together and discuss the various (drug) treatments and the performance of the doctors, guided by a clinical pharmacologist.

]. As far as the OSCE is concerned, this has also been shown to be useful for assessing therapeutic competence. Nevertheless, it is important that the manner in which the students are assessed is as similar as possible to the approach used in teaching them.
In conclusion, based on theories as to how physicians arrive at their therapeutic decisions, context-learning seems to be an effective way to teach CP&T to medical students. It is obvious that the ideal situation, i.e. real practice with real patients, is not always attainable, but various suboptimal forms of context-learning and assessment can be applied.

Conclusions and recommendations
In this document, the learning objectives of teaching CP&T to undergraduate medical students have been described, with an emphasis on therapeutic decision-making. Based on current theories of cognitive psychology and medical education, we have also discussed context-learning as an effective approach to teaching medical students how to prescribe rationally.

Clinical pharmacologists should play an important role in the development of prescribing skills by teaching CP&T to undergraduate medical students. It is recommended that they formulate a CP&T context-learning curriculum within the medical curriculum – of course, in collaboration with physicians. This curriculum must be based on the final learning objectives of the CP&T education programme in which the required level of therapeutic competence of medical graduates has been determined. In addition, the curriculum must fulfil the criteria of context-learning, i.e. gaining knowledge and skills simultaneously in a (simulated) clinical practice setting. Furthermore, for the sake of clarity, it is stressed that the CP&T curriculum should be a visible part of the medical curriculum and that students must know, from the beginning, the required level of competence when they graduate. Current medical students often do not recognise the various CP&T teaching activities since they are scattered through the medical curriculum.

In conclusion, effective undergraduate teaching of CP&T is essential to improve rational prescribing and will immunize students against factors that may induce irrational prescribing after graduation. Therefore, based on current knowledge about learning, cognitive psychology and research in therapeutic teaching, a CP&T curriculum should be a prominent part of the medical curriculum. The CP&T curriculum should also be linked to postgraduate and continuing education in order to maintain an optimal competence in rational prescribing after graduating. Finally, to achieve a CP&T curriculum, allies should be found because clinical pharmacologists can and should not work on this alone. Medical students are already allies; they are interested in clinical pharmacology and really want to learn how to prescribe drugs rationally. Physicians should also become allies, since they can provide the clinical context for teaching and can prevent students from copying the bad prescribing habits of some of the physicians that train medical students. Associate clinical pharmacologists must collectively determine the current state and perspectives of the undergraduate education of CP&T in Europe. To this end, a European research project, which is organised jointly by the EACPT and British Pharmacological Society, has recently been started.
It will not be easy to convince conservative medical faculties, reasonably comfortable with the current conventions that allow clinical impressions to substitute for systematic accumulation of behavioural evidence, that change (in teaching, ed.) is in order

]. In the fourth year, students start on their clinical clerkships. In collaboration with their clinical colleagues, the clinical pharmacology department introduces a therapeutic assignment during these clerkships. Students must observe several consultations by clinicians in a structured way according to the WHO six-step approach and discuss these in small groups during therapeutic sessions with a clinical pharmacologist and/or physician. Concurrently, students must follow a skills training programme in order to learn how to prescribe rationally (six steps). During the clinical clerkships in the fifth and sixth years, prescriptions written by the students are evaluated by a clinical pharmacologist in collaboration with a physician and pharmacist during therapeutic sessions. Finally, students must attend a course on how to evaluate CP&T literature and how they must apply this knowledge in practice.
It is evident that in an integrated or problem-based medical curriculum it will be difficult to organise lectures. However, an advantage of this type of curriculum is that teaching is already centred on patient cases. As a result, clinical pharmacologists can introduce learning tasks with respect to basic and clinical pharmacology and therapeutics. In such a curriculum, it will probably be easier to train students in the six-step approach in small group-teaching sessions and practice prescribing in a clinical setting.
