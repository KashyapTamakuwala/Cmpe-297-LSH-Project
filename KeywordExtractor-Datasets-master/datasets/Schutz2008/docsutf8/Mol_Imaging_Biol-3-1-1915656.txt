Purpose
d
-glucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) in oncological patients.

Procedures
Following a comprehensive search of the literature, two reviewers independently assessed the methodological quality of eligible studies. The diagnostic value of AC was studied through its sensitivity/specificity compared to histology, and by comparing the relative lesion detection rate reported with NAC-PET vs. AC, for full-ring and dual-head coincidence PET (FR- and DH-PET, respectively).

Results

Conclusions
Findings suggest similar sensitivity/specificity and lesion detection for NAC vs. AC FR-PET and significantly higher lesion detection for NAC vs. AC DH-PET.

Introduction
d
-glucose (FDG) imaging in an attempt to correct for these effects. With positron emission tomography (PET) scanners, this is accomplished by transmission scanning using a radionuclide source, such as germanium-68 or cesium-137, and with PET/computed tomography (CT) using CT. With respect to visual interpretation of the images, the added value of attenuation correction has been controversial. Whereas attenuation correction provides a more realistic image of FDG distribution, its application significantly increases acquisition times on standard full-ring (FR) PET scanners. In addition, the performance of attenuation correction can introduce noise and even artifact. Paradoxically, even if the nuclear medicine community sees attenuation correction, or the lack of it, as a potential effect-modifier of test accuracy, its impact is rarely accounted for in systematic reviews on the diagnostic accuracy of PET. As a result, the impact of attenuation correction on lesion detectability and interpretation of PET for oncological purposes is not well established. With PET/CT scanning, it is customary to evaluate either modality (primarily to account for artifacts), but one needs to know how to deal with discrepancies.
The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to determine the diagnostic accuracy of nonattenuation-corrected (NAC) and attenuation-corrected (AC) FDG-PET in oncological patients. We studied the effects of attenuation correction for both FR-PET and dual-head coincidence PET (DH-PET), and as a function of different body locations (head/neck, chest, abdomen/pelvis).

] as well as search terms identifying both radionuclide and X-ray transmission, emission, attenuation correction, and oncological studies in humans. In addition, the reference lists of the eligible articles were reviewed to ensure that relevant articles had not been missed.

Study Selection
From the list of retrieved articles, articles were initially evaluated for eligibility on the basis of title and abstract by two independent reviewers (UJ, PR). If there was uncertainty as to whether an article was eligible for inclusion, the entire article was reviewed. Inclusion criteria were (1) clinical studies evaluating FDG imaging with and without attenuation correction in oncology patients; (2) study population of at least ten patients; (3) sufficient detail to reconstruct a 2 × 2 contingency table expressing FDG imaging results by disease status, or sufficient detail to reconstruct relative lesion detection measurement of AC vs. NAC imaging; and (4) studies utilizing FR-PET and/or DH-PET. We excluded abstracts, editorials, and reviews, although the latter two categories were used for cross-referencing.

Data Extraction and Quantitative Analysis
In addition to methodological quality assessment, data related to the type of camera, the FDG dose, the time interval between injection and imaging, the transmission and emission acquisition protocols, the reconstruction protocol, and the interpretation protocol were independently extracted from each study by each reviewer. For studies where it was possible, a contingency 2 × 2 table was constructed. Disagreements were solved by consensus.
For studies using an independent gold standard (histopathology), we determined the sensitivity and specificity of the index tests using the number of true positive, false positive, true negative, and false negative results from the 2 × 2 contingency table. Furthermore, we calculated the “relative lesion detection,” defined as the percentage of lesions scoring equally positive or negative with NAC vs. AC images. We performed a subgroup analysis for different locations of lesions and analyzed sensitivity, specificity, or relative lesion detection of NAC vs. AC for lesion location in the head and neck region, the chest, and the abdominopelvic region. In cases of discrepancy of relative lesion detection between NAC and AC, we extracted data to analyze whether this was related to lesion size and/or intensity.
p
 value of less than 0.05 was considered significant.
All statistical analyses were performed with the SPSS 11.0.01 program for Windows (version 11.0.1., SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA).

Discussion
The cumulated evidence summarized in this systematic review of oncological FDG imaging studies suggests that the accuracy of attenuation and nonattenuation corrected FR-PET are similar. However, with DH coincidence imaging NAC images detect 12% less lesions than AC images, without prominent differences between body areas.

] reported an average of 3% more true positive lesions with NAC FR-PET. However, we expect that the resulting error is small because, in the comparison with histopathology, false positive rates were quite low for either modality. Despite this theoretical negative bias towards NAC, similar lesion detection rates were observed with both AC and NAC for FR-PET. Hence, attenuation correction may not contribute to the detection of malignancy using FR-PET. Conversely, with DH-PET, AC images demonstrated a significantly higher detection rate as opposed to NAC images, which is surprising given that AC images are usually significantly noisier than NAC images. We postulate that this may be secondary to differences in reconstruction/filtering algorithms.
2
, the studies had several quality limitations. Finally, meta-analyses are limited by publication bias, which biases towards the publication of favorable results or popular subjects.
We were surprised by the limited number of good comparative studies evaluating the value of attenuation correction. It appears that attenuation correction has been accepted as the standard of practice without sound scientific evidence to support it.

], a significantly improved visibility was demonstrated for 41% of lung metastases with NAC images as opposed to CT-AC images. This higher visibility for NAC images was even more pronounced for lesions smaller than 1 cm. These findings underline that even as PET/CT use becomes more widespread, evaluation of both NAC and AC images should remain an integral part of image interpretation, and not just to recognize image artifacts. At the same time, NAC vs. AC discrepancies at PET/CT offer an obvious opportunity for further investigation.

Conclusions
In this meta-analysis, we found no significant difference in sensitivity, specificity, or relative lesion detectability between AC and NAC FR FDG PET. However, attenuation correction improved lesion detection for DH coincidence imaging.
