Few studies have examined the presence, structure, and stability of behavior problems in a community sample of 14- and 19-month-old infants. A questionnaire with items on emotional, attentional, and impulsive behavior and social communication was completed by the parents of 6,491 infants aged 14 months and 1,803 infants aged 19 months. Particularly externalizing behavior problems were reported to present sometimes or often for 50% of more of the sample and could be considered as common. In contrast, social communication problems were reported to be present in less than 10% of the sample. Overall, boys showed more problem behaviors than girls. Principal component analysis at the 14 months data revealed seven factors, which could all be replicated in the 19 months data. Pearson correlations between scores at 14 months and 19 months were highest for oppositional and attention factors (0.68 and 0.63) and lowest for the inhibiton factor (0.38). More than 50% of those scoring in the top 10% for total problem score at 14 months were in the top 10% at 19 months. These results will facilitate the recognition of psychopathology at very early age and the study of its development over time.

], but to our knowledge stability has not been evaluated in younger children.
More knowledge on the expression and stability of problem behaviors before the age of 18 months would be advantageous, especially for doctors and nurses working in well baby clinics. In the Netherlands, infants visit well baby clinics according to a fixed scheme. At 14 months there is a relatively extensive check up. Since this is a moment for vaccination the attendance rate for this check up is high. Therefore, more knowledge on problem behaviors at especially 14-month-old was desirable. The current study was designed to investigate behaviors at this young age and had the following aims.
The first aim was to examine the occurrence of problem behaviors or lack of competences at younger age that are considered to be psychopathological in later childhood. A second aim was to examine whether the constructs of problem behaviors and competences usually found in older children are already present at 14 and 19 months of age. A third aim was to examine the short-term stability of parent-reported problem behavior and lack of competences between age 14 and 19 months. To achieve these aims, we used a questionnaire with 55 items on mainly externalizing and social communication behaviors.

Description of participants
Approximately 88% of the parents were Dutch, 1.3% were Turkish, 1.8% were Moroccan, 1.3% were from the Caribbean (Surinam or the Dutch Antilles), 0.4% were from other Western countries, and 0.5% were of non-Western origin. Questionnaires were completed by mothers (80.5%), fathers (10.7%), and by both (0.6%). Mean child age was 14.80 months (SD = 1.84). The mean number of children in the family was 1.80 (SD = 1.03). Mean birth weight was 3,537.5 g (SD = 823.9). Of all infants, 1% had a physical or mental disability, 4.1% had a physical disease, and 6.3% used medication. Parental education level varied: 43.8% had a high level of education, 38.1% had a medium level of education, and 15.5% had a low level of education.

] and based on our clinical experience with very young children. Then a multidisciplinary panel of experts with clinical and research experience with infants and toddlers made a final selection of items based on two criteria, namely, the item had to be specific for externalizing, social communication or internalizing problem behaviors and to be usable for infants younger than 18 months. The final selection included items that covered attentional problems, hyperactivity, oppositional behavior, aggressive behavior, verbal and non-verbal aspects of social communication (such as initiating and responding) and internalizing behaviors such as problems with eating or sleeping.


Data analyses

]. To validate the findings, PCA was performed on two split half samples Pearson correlations were calculated to examine the interrelationship between the factor sumscores. Finally, in order to examine possible two higher-order factors, PCA was performed requiring all items to load on two factors and Pearson correlations were calculated to examine their interrelationship.

Note
: Common is defined as >50% with score 1 or 2. Uncommon is defined as <10% with score 1 or 2. Please note further that items covering lack of competences were recoded in such way that a score of 2 represented the complete presence of an unwanted behavior or the complete absence of a wanted behavior. This explains why all items have the same-sign factor loadings

Factor structure of problem behavior
The principal component analysis with varimax rotation with eigenvalues >1.5 for two equally sized split half samples resulted in two very similar solutions. The scree test suggested a seven-factor PCA solution (eigenvalue >1.5) with a percentage explained variance of 34.6% (see Appendix to this paper for details). The PCA for the 19-month-old children showed the same factors as the analysis at 14 months, with 37.7% of explained variance. Five of the 55 items had higher loadings at 19 months on other factors than at 14 months.

]. Further work should therefore focus on longitudinal studies to decide where the cut-off point is and then start to index a risk for psychopathology.

]. This is not to say that these behaviors are unimportant or should be neglected. For example, other social communication items such as “failure to follow with the eyes,” “does not react to calling name,” and “does not imitate simple gestures” may indicate the presence of more serious psychopathology, such as autistic spectrum disorder. It would be interesting to determine whether the risk of later psychopathology is significantly higher for a combination of problem behaviors and for which combination this accounts. Also, the frequency or severity of these social communication problems is associated with a serious risk of problems later in development.

]. Also, our dimension Explorative behavior is partly in line with ITSEA’s Mastery motivation and partly with the Socialization scale of the Vineland. Furthermore, our dimension Dysregulation consists mainly of items of the Internalizing dimension of the CBCL 1.5–5. Finally, most of the items seen in our dimension Inhibition are found in the Other Problem dimension of the CBCL 1.5–5 and some are from the Internalizing and Competence domain of the ITSEA.

]. These studies investigated children older than 19 months of age, whereas our results suggest that these problem behaviors are already moderately stable at an even younger age, emphasizing the need for early assessment. We can only speculate on the determinants of this stability, such as the child’s temperament, family environment, or parental variables. It would be interesting to investigate these determinants in relation to the frequency, severity, and pervasiveness of behavior problems over a longer period of time, for example, at 14, 19, and 36 months of age, in order to gather information on how problem behavior evolves.

]. Future work should include measures of impairment of functioning and should focus on more in-depth assessments of psychopathology and level of cognitive development. Finally, it may be informative to compare a population-based sample with a clinically referred group.

Clinical implications
This study underlines the growing need to identify problem behavior in early development. A better understanding of what is normal and abnormal in early infant-toddler development is of great value for the recognition of early psychopathology. Normative data for the prevalence and stability of behavior problems of 1- and 2-year-old children in a normal population may make it possible to provide early effective preventive intervention programs, in addition to background information for clinicians and researchers in order to develop such programs.
In summary, externalizing behaviors were the most common, and social communication the least common, problems reported in a population sample of 14-month-old children. Boys were reported to show significantly more problems of externalizing behavior and competences. These behaviors were moderately stable over a 5-month period, between the ages of 14 and 19 months.
