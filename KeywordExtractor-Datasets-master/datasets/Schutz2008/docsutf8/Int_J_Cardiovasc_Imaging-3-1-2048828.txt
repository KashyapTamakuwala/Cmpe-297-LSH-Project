Aim
To detect the accuracy of real-time three-dimensional echocardiography (RT3DE) and two-dimensional echocardiography (2DE) for tricuspid annulus (TA) assessment compared with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

Methods
Thirty patients (mean age 34 ± 13 years, 60% males) in sinus rhythm were examined by MRI, RT3DE, and 2DE for TA assessment. End-diastolic and end-systolic TA diameter (TAD) and TA fractional shortening (TAFS) were measured by RT3DE, 2DE, and MRI. End-diastolic and end-systolic TA area (TAA) and TA fractional area changes (TAFAC) were measured by RT3DE and MRI. End-diastolic and end-systolic right ventricular (RV) volumes and ejection fraction (RV-EF) were measured by MRI.

Conclusion
RT3DE helps in accurate assessment of TA comparable to MRI and may have an important implication in the TV surgical decision-making processes. RT3DE analysis of TA function could be used as a marker of RV function.

]. This study aimed to use RT3DE in evaluation of TA morphology, size and cyclic changes during the cardiac cycle. It also aimed to correlate TA function with RV function that was assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

Subjects and methods
The study included 30 patients (mean age 34 ± 13 years, 60% were males) who were scheduled for routine MRI examination for evaluation of right ventricular function (10 patients with congenital heart disease, five with chronic pulmonary disease, five with multivalvular affection, and 10 normals). 2DE and RT3DE were performed at the same day of MRI examination after their informed consent for assessment of TA. The inclusion criteria for selection were good 2D image quality, sinus rhythm and mild to moderate tricuspid regurgitation.

Discussion
In the present study, the morphological and functional aspects of TA were assessed by MRI and RT3DE. The main findings of our study are (1) TA shape was not circular but oval, (2) TAD measurement by RT3DE is more accurate than by 2DE, and (3) TA function was fairly correlated with RV function.

Study limitation
The main limitation of this study is that RT3DE images more critically depend on image quality than 2DE images and the value of RT3DE should be assessed in a more non-selected (image quality). Due to the high cost of MRI, a small number of patients were included.


Conclusions
RT3DE helps in accurate assessment of TA comparable to MRI, while 2DE could not be relied on due to underestimation. This may have important implications in the TV surgical decision-making processes. RT3DE analysis of TA function could be used as a marker of RV function.
