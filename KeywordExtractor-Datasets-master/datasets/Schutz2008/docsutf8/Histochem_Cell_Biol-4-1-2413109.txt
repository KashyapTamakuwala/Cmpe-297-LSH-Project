The formation of stable cell–cell contacts is required for the generation of barrier-forming sheets of epithelial and endothelial cells. During various physiological processes like tissue development, wound healing or tumorigenesis, cellular junctions are reorganized to allow the release or the incorporation of individual cells. Cell–cell contact formation is regulated by multiprotein complexes which are localized at specific structures along the lateral cell junctions like the tight junctions and adherens junctions and which are targeted to these site through their association with cell adhesion molecules. Recent evidence indicates that several major protein complexes exist which have distinct functions during junction formation. However, this evidence also indicates that their composition is dynamic and subject to changes depending on the state of junction maturation. Thus, cell–cell contact formation and integrity is regulated by a complex network of protein complexes. Imbalancing this network by oncogenic proteins or pathogens results in barrier breakdown and eventually in cancer. Here, I will review the molecular organization of the major multiprotein complexes at junctions of epithelial cells and discuss their function in cell–cell contact formation and maintenance.

). Common to all three types of structures is the presence of several adhesion molecules that link the neighbouring cells through homophilic and heterophilic adhesive interactions, and the presence of cytoplasmic scaffolding proteins that organize signaling complexes and which provide a mechanical link to the actin cytoskeleton (or intermediate filaments in the case of desmosomes). The scaffolding proteins might also link different protein complexes—at least temporarily—and thus organize supramolecular protein complexes. It should be noted that these protein complexes are dynamic, and that their composition is subject to regulation depending on junctional maturation and integrity. During the last few years, a rapid progress has been made in identifying new proteins at cell–cell contacts and in particular in deciphering the molecular composition of the TJs. Among the most exciting findings was probably the discovery of protein complexes at TJs which are highly conserved through evolution and which regulate cellular polarization in different organisms and various cell types. Here, I will review the major multiprotein complexes present at cell–cell contacts of vertebrate epithelial cells and highlight the most recent advances in the understanding of their role in the organization and functions of epithelial cell–cell contacts in vertebrates.

). As pointed out above, the activation of these small GTPases is probably required to facilitate junction formation suggesting that nectins cooperate with cadherins in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton at sites of cell adhesion. However, in addition they might also help to regulate the formation of tight junctions and their physical separation from AJs during junctional maturation (see below).

Integral membrane proteins at tight junctions of epithelial and endothelial can be grouped into three classes based on their overall organizations. The first class is characterized by two extracellular loops, four transmembrane regions, and two cytoplasmic tails (occludin, claudins, tricellulin). The second class consists of Ig-SF members which all contain two Ig-like domains. The third class (contains only one member, CRB3) is characterized by a short extracellular domain (36 AA), a single transmembrane domain and a short cytoplasmic tail. In contrast to the other integral membrane proteins, the function of the extracellular domain of CRB3 is not clear

). After the localization of the first set of proteins at pAJs other proteins can be recruited through direct physical interactions with those already present. For example, α-catenin-associated ZO-1 could serve to recruit occludin and claudins, afadin could serve to recruit JAM-A and nectin-2 (or vice versa), and JAM-A or nectin-2 could recruit PAR-3 which serves as scaffold to assemble the PAR-3–aPKC–PAR-6 complex.

 PAR-1 phosphorylates PAR-3/Bazooka thereby inhibiting its dimerization and blocking its ability to assemble a functional PAR-3–aPKC–PAR-6 complex. As a result, the PAR-3–aPKC–PAR-6 complex is absent from PAR-1-containing membrane domains. Through these reciprocal inhibitory interactions two distinct membrane domains are generated characterized by the mutual exclusion of aPKC and PAR-1. Thus, by regulating the formation of a specific membrane domain from which certain proteins are actively excluded, aPKC could indirectly promote the formation of TJs. It is not clear, yet, if the abilities of the PAR-3–aPKC–PAR-6 complex to regulate TJ formation and to regulate membrane asymmetry are mechanistically linked.

: Ser345-phosphorylated PAR-6 recruits Smurf1 leading to ubiquitination and degradation of the local pool of RhoA. As a consequence, the integrity of TJs is disturbed, the polarized morphology can not be maintained and the development of a fibroblastoid morphology is facilitated. In addition to PAR-6 phosphorylation, TGFβ signaling also induces downregulation of PAR-3. By targeting the PAR-3–aPKC–PAR-6 complex at TJs, TGFβ impairs the ability of cells to maintain a polarized morphology

Conclusions and perspectives
The last decade has witnessed a steady increase in the number of new proteins localized at cell–cell contacts of epithelial cells. The identification of claudins at TJs has strongly increased the understanding of the molecular basis of TJ function. The identification of cell polarity protein complexes like the PAR-3–aPKC–PAR-6 complex and the CRB3–Pals1–PATJ complex at TJs has added new aspects on the mechanisms underlying the development of TJs. The identification of the nectin–afadin system provided evidence for a second major adhesive system besides the cadherin–catenin system at AJs. It also became evident that TJs and AJs are signaling centers which are actively engaged in regulating proliferation and differentiation through feed-back mechanisms with the cytoskeleton and the nucleus.

Nevertheless, the use of a set of conserved proteins by morphologically diverse cell types to regulate cell–cell contact formation highlights both the importance of the proteins for cellular function as well as their versatility that allows the regulation of similar aspects in different cell types.

) but it is unclear if a similar hierarchy exists in vertebrate epithelial cells and which aspects of cell–cell contact formation are regulated by these interactions. Most likely, many of these interactions are dynamically regulated and occur in a temporally and spatially restricted manner. The large number of scaffolding and signaling molecules identified at cell–cell contacts and the multitude of physical interactions described so far among these proteins indicates that cell–cell contact formation, the development of TJs from pAJs and the aquisition of membrane polarity is a highly dynamic process the complexity of which is still far from being completely understood.
