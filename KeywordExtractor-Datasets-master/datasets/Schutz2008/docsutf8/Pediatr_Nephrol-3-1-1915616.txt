Escherichia coli
 strains) plays a central role in typical hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). It damages the renal endothelium by inhibiting the cellular protein synthesis. Also, the monocyte has a specific receptor for Stx but is not sensitive for the cytotoxic effect. In this work, monocytes were studied as a potential transporter for Stx to the renal endothelium. Coincubation of isolated human monocytes loaded with Stx and target cells (vero cells and human umbilical vascular endothelial cells) were performed. Transfer was determined by measuring the protein synthesis of target cells and by flow cytometry. Furthermore, the effect of a temperature shift on loaded monocytes was investigated. Stx-loaded monocytes reduced the protein synthesis of target cells. After adding an antibody against Stx, incomplete recovery occurred. Also, adding only the supernatant of coincubation was followed by protein synthesis inhibition. Stx detached from its receptor on the monocyte after a change in temperature, and no release was detected without this temperature shift. Although the monocyte plays an important role in the pathogenesis of HUS, it has no role in the transfer of Stx.

]. These events will have a pro-inflammatory effect.
We postulated that, as the monocyte has a specific receptor, it might also function as a carrier to transport Stx to the renal endothelium. To investigate this hypothesis, Stx was loaded to isolated monocytes from healthy donors and coincubated with target cells [vero cells and human umbilical cord venous endothelial cells (HUVEC)]. The level of transfer was determined by measuring the protein synthesis of these target cells and the transfer of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled B subunit of Stx1 with flow cytometry.

As renal endothelial damage is already present after the occurrence of clinical symptoms of HUS, it is very important to develop efficacious early prevention. Understanding the mechanism in which the toxin is specifically targeted to the kidney can lead to novel intervention strategies.
