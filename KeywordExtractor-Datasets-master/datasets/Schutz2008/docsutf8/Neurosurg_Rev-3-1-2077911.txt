Foramen magnum meningiomas are challenging tumors, requiring special considerations because of the vicinity of the medulla oblongata, the lower cranial nerves, and the vertebral artery. After detailing the relevant anatomy of the foramen magnum area, we will explain our classification system based on the compartment of development, the dural insertion, and the relation to the vertebral artery. The compartment of development is most of the time intradural and less frequently extradural or both intraextradural. Intradurally, foramen magnum meningiomas are classified posterior, lateral, and anterior if their insertion is, respectively, posterior to the dentate ligament, anterior to the dentate ligament, and anterior to the dentate ligament with extension over the midline. This classification system helps to define the best surgical approach and the lateral extent of drilling needed and anticipate the relation with the lower cranial nerves. In our department, three basic surgical approaches were used: the posterior midline, the postero-lateral, and the antero-lateral approaches. We will explain in detail our surgical technique. Finally, a review of the literature is provided to allow comparison with the treatment options advocated by other skull base surgeons.

The prerequisite for treating FM meningiomas (FMMs) is the perfect knowledge of the surgical anatomy. We will then first detail a comprehensive review of the relevant anatomy of the FM area with special emphasis on the vertebral artery (VA) V3 and V4 segments. Second, we will describe our classification system. This classification system helps for determining the best surgical approach and for anticipating the position of lower cranial nerves. The technical aspects of our surgical approaches will then be detailed extensively. Finally, we provide a summary of the relevant literature, detailing surgical results and surgical approaches advocated by other skull base surgeons and discussing the extent of bone resection and the need for fusion.

The VA V4 segment ascends from the dura up to the anterior aspect of the pontomedullary sulcus where it joins the controlateral one to form the basilar artery. Initially, the VA V4 segment faces posteriorly and medially the occipital condyle, the hypoglossal canal, and the jugular tubercle. Later, the VA V4 segment lies on the clivus and runs in front of the hypoglossal and the lower cranial nerves rootlets.
At the FM level, the VA V4 segment is at the origin of several branches: the PICA, the anterior spinal artery, the anterior and posterior meningeal arteries.

The definitive objective of a classification system is to define preoperatively the surgical strategy based on preoperative imaging characteristics of the lesion. The surgical strategy in cases of FMMs is the surgical approach but also the anticipation of modified vital structure position.

Anterior meningiomas push the spinal cord posteriorly. Therefore, the surgical opening between the neuraxis and the FM lateral wall is narrow, and the drilling must extend to the medial part of the FM lateral wall to improve the access. In almost every case, no drilling of the lateral mass of the atlas and occipital condyle is necessary. Exceptionally, anterior meningiomas of small size without anterior compartment enlargement need more bone resection but never includes more than one fifth of these elements. On the other hand, lateral meningiomas displace the neuraxis posterolaterally and widely open the surgical access; therefore, the drilling has never to be extended into the lateral mass of the atlas or the occipital condyle.
Above the VA

Below the VA

On both sides of the VA



Meningiomas are more often located below the VA. In this case, the lower cranial nerves are always pushed cranially and posteriorly. There is no need to look for them. They will come into view on reaching the superior tumoral part. On the other hand, if the lesion grows above the VA, the position of the lower cranial nerves cannot be anticipated; the nerves may be displaced separately in any direction. After partial debulking of the tumor, one has to look for them so as to identify and protect them during the tumor resection. In case of tumoral development on both sides of the VA, a similar problem may exist with the position of the lower cranial nerves. Moreover, the dura around the VA penetration may be infiltrated by the tumor. As previously mentioned, the dura is normally adherent to the adventitia, and complete resection of the tumor at this level is hazardous. In this case, which is rarely observed, it may be safer to leave a cuff of infiltrated dura around the VA and to coagulate this zone.

Surgical aspects
Preoperative and perioperative considerations
Standard preoperative workup includes magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT) scan, and sometimes angiography.
On MRI, gadolinium-enhanced sequences help to precisely delimit the dural attachment zone, the tumor, and its relation to neural and vascular structures. On T2-weighted images, the presence of an arachnoid plane between the tumor and the neuraxis is sometimes visible.
Bone windows CT scan is helpful in case of extradural extension to investigate bone erosion and to schedule preoperatively the need for fusion.
If a highly vascularized tumor is suspected and embolization is contemplated

Surgical approaches and techniques at Lariboisière Hospital

]. In such cases, the neuraxis is pushed anteriorly.
The patient may be in the sitting, ventral, or lateral position. To decrease venous bleedings, the sitting position is preferred at Lariboisière Hospital as far as there is no contraindication such as a patent foramen ovale; air embolism is prevented by hypervolemia and G-suit.
The skin is incised on the midline from the occipital protuberance down to the upper cervical region. The midline avascular plane is opened between the posterior muscles, up to the occipital protuberance and down to the spinous process of C2. Bone opening is performed using a drill and Kerrison rongeurs and is always limited to the lower part of the occipital bone and the posterior arch of the atlas. The dura is then incised in a T- or Y-shaped fashion and retracted with stitches.

The postero-lateral approach is a lateral extension of the midline posterior approach. The patient must be carefully positioned in the same position as during a posterior midline approach. The head must be placed in neutral position. Any flexion must be avoided because it decreases the space in front of the neuraxis and therefore may worsen the compression and the neurological condition. The vertical midline skin incision is identical, but the incision is curved laterally on the tumoral side just below the occipital protuberance toward the mastoid process. The posterior muscles are divided along the occipital crest and retracted laterally to expose the occipital bone, the posterior arch of the atlas, and the C2 lamina, if required. The exposure may be extended on a limited way on the contralateral side.
VA exposure
23
47
]. After being fully exposed, the VA can be gently displaced superiorly to show the lateral mass of the atlas.
Bone opening
 The posterior arch of the atlas is resected with rongeurs from the midline toward the transverse process. To obtain a decompression of the neuraxis before the tumoral resection, the posterior arch of the atlas must also be resected beyond the midline toward the controlateral side. By this way, hyperpressure induced even by gentle manipulation during resection are not transmitted to the neuraxis. The lower part of the occipital bone is drilled or resected with rongeurs laterally toward the sigmoid sinus and also beyond the midline.
The lateral extension of the bone opening is established according to the position of the meningioma. In case of lateral meningiomas, the spinal cord is displaced toward the contralateral side, and then any resection of the FM lateral wall is not necessary. In case of anterior meningiomas, the spinal cord is pushed posteriorly, and the surgical corridor has to be enlarged laterally by drilling up to the medial side of the C1 lateral mass and/or the occipital condyle. Drilling further the lateral mass of the atlas or the occipital condyle is exceptionally necessary. In the exceptional case where the opening must be enlarged, no more than 20% of the medial part of the FM lateral wall has to be drilled. In such a way, stabilization is never required.
The cranio-caudal bone resection is scheduled according to the position of the tumor regarding to the VA. The drilling has to be extended toward the lateral mass of the atlas if the tumor grows below the VA, to the jugular tubercle and the occipital condyle if it grows above, and toward both parts of the FM lateral wall, if it encircles the VA on both sides.
Dura opening
 The most adequate dural incision is a curvilinear incision starting at the inferolateral corner then running vertically at a paramedian level (5 to 10 mm from the midline) and curving toward the superolateral corner. This type of incision permits to take the maximum benefit of the bone opening without contraincision and is generally easy to close. Keeping the dura over the neuraxis provides protection during the surgical dissection. Moreover, arachnoid connections between the dura and the medulla are left undissected to prevent an anterior fall of the neuraxis during tumor resection.
Intradural step
 Lateral meningiomas are directly brought into view and their dural attachment directly accessible. Contrarily, anterior meningiomas are partially hidden by the neuraxis. The first step of the intradural stage, before beginning tumor resection, is to identify several important structures and to open the surgical access to the lesion by completely releasing the neuraxis. Important structures are the VA, the accessory nerve, and the dentate ligament. The VA is identified by following the course of the V3 segment where it pierces the dura matter. The first two digits of the dentate ligament have to be divided. To further improve the surgical access, the first cervical nerve root can be divided distal to its connections with the accessory nerve.
At this step, the surgical technique must be individualized according to the tumor location: above, below, or on both sides of the VA.
As previously mentioned, in cases of tumor developed below the VA, the lower cranial nerves are always pushed cranially and posteriorly by the tumor. These nerves will then be found at the superior pole of the lesion at the end of the surgery. The resection must start at the caudal aspect of the meningioma with the goal to release the dural attachment and to suppress the vascular supply first; then, the tumor is debulked in a dry surgical field with a sucker, an ultrasound aspirator, or a laser, according to the tumor consistency. When liberating the dural insertion, it is important to keep undetached a small part of the base, at the side of the neuraxis, to avoid free movement of the lesion, which can be responsible for inadvertent damage to the neuraxis during the remnant resection. When hollowing the tumor, a small layer is also kept with its capsule against the neuraxis. This part will be resected at the last surgical step and under better conditions when the meningioma is completely devascularized and the surgical field widely open.
If the tumor is developed above the VA, two special points must be taken into consideration: the displacement of the lower cranial nerves and the dissection of the VA branches. Indeed, in such location, the displacement of the lower cranial nerves cannot be anticipated. To prevent damage, the rootlets must be under control on the side of the jugular foramen and then followed along their courses more or less adherent to the meningioma. With the lesion being progressively debulked, the nerve rootlets can be more easily mobilized, often inferiorly, to allow a more confident tumor resection at some distance from fragile nervous structures. The tumor dissection from the VA branches, especially the PICA, is another difficulty encountered only with tumors developed above the VA. Precise knowledge of the patient anatomy based on preoperative investigation is mandatory.
If the meningioma encases the VA, the technique is identical as described above. Special consideration is nevertheless required if the meningioma has its insertion on the dura surrounding the VA penetration. The dural resection is better achieved by progressing from the extradural side toward the intradural aspect, along the VA because the VA invaginates into the dura with its periosteal sheath. This furrow can be resected as much as the VA adventitia is not invaded.
Dural closure
 A watertight dural closure is required to prevent a postoperative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage. The closure is generally easy with the curvilinear incision. If necessary, a dural patch using the suboccipital aponeurosis achieves a perfect closure. In any case, the muscular and aponeurosis layers must be tightly closed.

Antero-lateral approach
15

].
8
]. Some points required nevertheless special consideration. The head has to be slightly extended with a rotation of 60° toward the opposite side. Because of this rotation, VA segments above and below the C1 posterior arch run parallel, separated by this bone. Opening the C1 transverse foramen is mandatory for VA transposition.
Bone opening
 When completely liberated, the VA can be pulled out and transposed, bringing into view the FM lateral wall as the occipital condyle, the anterior and posterior arches of the atlas, the lateral mass of the atlas, and the C1–C2 joint become visible.
The exposure must now be adapted to each case, depending on the location and extension of the meningioma. The odontoid process can be reached by passing over the C1–C2 joint. The mastoid process can be resected and small bridging bone removed to open completely the jugular foramen from the end of the sigmoid sinus, to the jugular tubercle just underneath the junction with the jugular bulb, up to the beginning of the internal jugular vein.
Dura opening
 The dural opening is most of the time out of concern because the antero-lateral approach is mainly indicated for extradural meningiomas. When lesions are developed in both extradural and intradural compartment, the dura is already opened by the lesion and must only be enlarged.
Dural closure
 Dural closure can be a considerable problem in cases where the dural defect is anteriorly located at the level of the clivus, the anterior arch of the atlas, and the odontoid process.

Postoperative complications
The antero-lateral approach could induce a transient dysfunction of the accessory nerve by the nerve manipulation, responsible for pain along the trapezius muscle and weakness of the trapezius muscle and/or the SM muscle. During this approach, manipulation of the sympathetic chain could also be at the origin of a transient Horner’s syndrome.
VA damage has never been observed. In case of tumoral encasement, a balloon occlusion test must be realized.
Preservation of the lower CNs can be hazardous. If CN IX and X are damaged, postoperative swallowing problems must be anticipated.

Surgical approaches, extent of bone resection, and need for fusion
FMMs are undoubtedly challenging tumors, requiring special considerations because of the vicinity of the brainstem, medulla oblongata, lower cranial nerves, and the VA. Several approaches have been advocated. The definite goals are to achieve the largest tumor removal and the lowest morbidity rate as possible. Minimizing the morbidity is obtained by choosing the appropriate exposure. The approach must allow adequate controls of important neurovascular structures, without exposing to unnecessary risks.
There is no discussion about the best surgical approach of posterior FMMs. The posterior approach is the best option, is well known by neurosurgeons, and is associated with a low morbidity rate.
The debate about the best surgical approach is more open for lateral and mainly anterior FMMs.

], the far-lateral approach is a lateral suboccipital approach directed behind the sternocleidomastoid muscle and the VA and just medial to the occipital and atlantal condyles and the atlanto-occipital joint. The extreme lateral approach is a direct lateral approach deep to the anterior part of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and behind the internal jugular vein along the front of the VA. In fact, both approaches permit drilling of the occipital condyle but provide a different exposure because of the differences in the approach direction.

The exposure allowed by the far-lateral retrocondylar or partial transcondylar approach is adequate for resecting even anterior intradural FMMs. The supposed benefit in term of exposure provided by the extreme transcondylar approach is counterbalanced by the risks associated with the CN XI dissection, the VA transposition, and the condyle drilling.

Conclusions
FMMs are challenging tumors in the vicinity of the brainstem, the VA, and lower cranial nerves. Several surgical approaches are possible, each one with specific indications. The drilling of the FM lateral wall required during the approaches is always limited and by itself should not be at the origin of any instability. Postoperative complications can be dramatic and must be anticipated.

Comments

Allessandro Ducati, Torino, Italy
This excellent paper summarizes the wide experience accumulated over several years by the group of Bernard George, concerning a very difficult topic among the neurosurgical procedures, i.e. foramen magnum meningiomas (FMM). This subject has been treated in the literature several times, and there is debate (or confusion?) concerning the best approach and the best strategy to treat FMM (see for instance the very interesting summary on the topic by Rhoton and De Oliveira, in Surgery of the Craniovertebral Junction, Dickman et al. Eds., Thieme, 1998, pp. 13–57). One of the merits of this paper is its extreme lucidity and simplicity that reflect the familiarity of the authors with the problem of FMM. This work is easy to read, easy to remember, full of useful details, clear. Of great value is the accuracy of description of surgical anatomy: particularly the normal course and variation of the vertebral artery (VA), together with its spinal and meningeal branches, and the relationships among these and lower cranial nerves and dentate ligaments. Surgical planning and anticipation of possible dislocation of normal structures is another precious contribution. The description of surgical procedure step by step is exceptionally clear and helps to carry out the operation by any surgeon with a sufficient experience even not specific for this rare pathology. The classification is simple and based on facts that affect the surgical strategy. The idea that inspires the whole paper is that of achieving the maximal resection of FMM with maximal respect for all the structures, of course nerves and vessels, but also bone, in order not to cause postoperative instability. The Discussion is mainly centered on this point, and reaches convincing conclusions, based on the excellent results of the reported series. For surgeons who do not have the same experience and the same ability of Bernard George (and of course I am among them), maybe some opinions may appear a little bit too rigid, excellent in his hands but not necessarily in other’s. For instance: the sitting position used at the Lariboisière Hospital can be excellent in a short procedure of an expert, but may have more complications the longer it is; or the renounce to use intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring, especially useful when the nerve roots are intermingled with the tumour in FMM arising above the VA; or, finally, the choice not to transpose the VA routinely in the postero-lateral approach, that makes me anxious about a possible inadvertent lesion of the artery during surgery. Altogether, this is a great contribution to the neurosurgical culture, emphasizing the need for a very detailed anatomical knowledge, a thorough strategically planning and a careful surgical execution.

Volker Seifert, Frankfurt, Germany
This article is an excellent review of the surgical management of foramen magnum meningioma described by one of the most experienced skull base surgeons. In this paper Professor George details his experience and understanding of the different types of foramen magnum meningiomas. He classifies them based on their site of origin into anterior, lateral, and posterior foramen magnum meningiomas. He then details the different strategies and approaches to each type adding several tips based on his own personal experience. For the posteriorly located meningioma it is obvious that the posterior approach is enough. For those originating from the anterior aspect of the FM he favors the postero-lateral (far-lateral) approach and stresses the fact that the tumor itself, especially when large, it opens the corridor to the anterior aspect of the brainstem and upper spinal cord, to where an extreme lateral (transcondylar) approach is not necessary. While we agree with him that in a good number of cases this is true, the extreme lateral approach has its role and should not be a source of increased morbidity, as suggested by the authors, if the anatomic details of the region are well understood. What may challenge the exposure in this region is the complex venous plexus which could lead to cumbersome oozing that may hinder anatomic dissection. More recently we have been injecting Tiseal (fibrin glue) into the perivertebral venous plexus which controls venous oozing and this helped in performing an almost cadaver-like dissection.
Meningiomas continue to be surgical lesions. foramen magnum meningiomas in particular are not ideal for treatment with other modalities such as radiosurgery in view of the proximity of these tumors to the brainstem and the morbidity resulting from the persistent brainstem compression. As a result, this article, written by a very experienced skull-base neurosurgeon, provides valuable details and tips that can be used during surgical resection of foramen magnum meningiomas, and is an important addition to the neurosurgical literature.

This article is a valuable overview dealing with the surgical anatomy and classification of foramen magnum meningiomas, describing the surgical technique and reviewing the pertinent literature to the subject. It presents the vast experience of the senior author (BG), accumulated over many years, and also reflected in previous publications. It is nicely shown that, when dealing with lesions of the foramen magnum, the vertebral artery is an anatomical structure of particular importance to the surgeon, as the artery may frequently be encased by tumor or present anatomical variations that must be respected during surgery. The technique used by Dr. Bernard George is well comprehensible and his method of subdividing the meningiomas according to their exact location and attachment should be a stimulus for others to adopt this classification system. On the other hand, the discussion on how much bone should be resected or not is somewhat overemphasized by the authors. Admittedly, the main criterion in this discussion should be the preserved function of the atlantooccipital joint, rendering a stabilization procedure unnecessary. As long as stability is preserved, however, bony resection can be varied according to the requirements of each specific case. My own experience comprises over 160 intradural lesions of the foramen magnum (meningiomas, aneurysms, ependymomas, hemangioblastomas, cavernomas, gliomas, neurinomas, metastatic carcinomas, epidermoid cysts, lipomas, AVMs and neurenteric cysts). While meningiomas or schwannomas may, indeed, significantly distort and displace the brainstem and spinal cord and thus reduce the necessity for extensive bony drilling, others do not alter the gross anatomy of the brainstem, as for instance small aneurysms or intraaxial cavernomas of the medulla. In such cases it is essential to first drill the posteromedial portion of the occipital condyle and part of the jugular tubercle in order to obtain an adequate view to the surgical target, or to allow control over the distal vertebral artery when temporary clipping is required. Such an exposure can only be achieved by a tailored but sufficient bony resection which I apply also in meningioma cases in order to first expose the dural attachment of the tumor. Overall, I have not encountered postoperative instability in any of these cases, even after extensive bony drilling. To conclude, we all can learn from this interesting article and the authors are to be commended for their instructive description and good results.
