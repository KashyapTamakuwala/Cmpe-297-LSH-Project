For many years, prorenin has been considered to be nothing more than the inactive precursor of renin. Yet, its elevated levels in diabetic subjects with microvascular complications and its extrarenal production at various sites in the body suggest otherwise. This review discusses the origin, regulation, and enzymatic activity of prorenin, its role during renin inhibition, and the angiotensin-dependent and angiotensin-independent consequences of its binding to the recently discovered (pro)renin receptor. The review ends with the concept that prorenin rather than renin determines tissue angiotensin generation.

Enzymatic activity of prorenin?

]. Nonproteolytically activated prorenin is enzymatically active and can be recognized by monoclonal antibodies that are specific for the active site. Kinetic studies of the nonproteolytic activation process have indicated that an equilibrium exists between the closed (inactive) and open (active) forms of prorenin. The inactivation step is highly temperature dependent and occurs very rapidly at neutral pH and 37°C. Consequently, under physiological conditions, <2% of prorenin is in the open and active form, i.e., displays enzymatic activity, and >98% is closed and inactive.

In addition, prorenin binding to the receptor results in effects (intracellular signaling) that are independent of angiotensin generation. HRP is assumed to block both prorenin activation and the direct prorenin-induced effects (see text for further explanation)

]. Thus, it is uncertain to what degree the beneficial in vivo effects of HRP are solely due to prorenin blockade. Such effects are unlikely to involve renin, since HRP will not block renin–(pro)renin receptor interaction.

Conclusion
After many years, it now seems that a function for prorenin has been found. The ‘inactive’ renin precursor gains Ang I-generating activity by binding to a receptor, without undergoing proteolytic cleavage. This mechanism explains how prorenin might contribute to tissue angiotensin generation, even when no prorenin–renin conversion occurs outside the kidney. Renin inhibitors will bind to such open activated prorenin, to the same degree as they bind to renin, and may thus be the ideal tools to block tissue angiotensin generation. In vitro studies suggest that prorenin also acts as an agonist of the (pro)renin receptor, inducing intracellular signaling pathways in an angiotensin-independent manner. However, given the contradictory data obtained with the (pro)renin receptor blocker HRP, more work is needed to verify the in vivo importance of such prorenin-induced (pro)renin receptor activation.
