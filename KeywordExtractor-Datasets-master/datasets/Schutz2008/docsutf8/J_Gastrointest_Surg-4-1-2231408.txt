 genotype it may be feasible to limit the patients undergoing antibiotic therapy to those who have this genotype. When this specific type is not present, another cause of PPU should be looked for and antibiotic therapy should not be started. This would mean cost reduction and, probably, a reduction in the speed of the development of antibiotic resistance.

 were analyzed by means of reverse hybridization on a strip (32). This assay consists of a nitrocellulose strip that contains dT-tailed oligonucleotide probes immobilized as parallel lines. For each strain, 10 μl of each PCR product (containing biotin at the 5′ end of each primer) was denatured by the addition of an equal amount of 400 mM NaOH and 10 mM EDTA in a plastic trough. After 5 min, 1 ml of prewarmed hybridization solution (2× SSC [1× SSC is 0.15 M NaCl plus 0.015 M sodium citrate], 50 mM Tris–HCl [pH 7.5], 0.1% SDS) was added, and a strip was submerged and incubated in a shaking water bath at 50°C for 1 h. The strips were washed with 2 ml of 2× SSC-0.1% SDS for 30 min at 50°C. Subsequently, the strips were rinsed three times in phosphate buffer, and conjugate (streptavidin–alkaline phosphatase) was added. After incubation at room temperature for 30 min, the strips were rinsed again and 4-nitroblue tetrazolium chloride and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate substrate was added. Hybrids are visible as purple probe lines. Interpretation of the hybridization patterns was performed visually. As a control, a β-globin PCR was performed. Patient related factors were obtained prospectively. Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS for Windows, version 11.0.

Results
A total of 30 patients were included of whom nine were women. The average age was 65 years, varying between 40 and 87. Ten patients (33.3%) were operated laparoscopically. The perforation was found prepyloric in 11 patients, at the site of the pylorus in eight patients and postpyloric in 11 patients.
A total of five (16.7%) patients had a history of PUD. Ten patients (33.3%) used NSAID’s, two patients (6.7%) used steroids, three patients (10.0%) used acid reducers, and one patient (3.3%) used a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) before admission to the hospital. The average hospital stay was 11.9 days, varying between 3 and 37 days.

The β-globin determination was performed as a control. In nine samples of nasogastric tube fluid and in two samples of lavage fluid it was negative, rendering these results as unreliable. Therefore, these results were excluded from further analysis.

 in the biopsy specimen, the lavage fluid analysis detected it in 100% of cases. The specificity of lavage fluid analysis was 66.7%, which means the chance for false-positives is over 30%. With regard to gender, age, BMI, history of PUD, location of perforation, complications after procedure, and use of steroids, PPI, or antihistaminic medication, no statistically significant correlation was found.

-positive strains seemed to be low; however, this number is distorted because in two of nine positive biopsies, a decent comparison with the other samples was not possible. In patient 5, genotyping of the lavage fluid and nasogastric tube fluid was incomplete, and for patient 15, the opposite was the case. This means that the actual incidence should be 71.4 % (5/7).

 status can be done with lavage fluid as well, obviously without any risk of bleeding and closure related difficulties. The sensitivity is 100%, but the specificity is 66.7%. This could mean the chance for false-positives is over 30%, which is not optimal and could lead to therapy overshoot. However, considering the fact that with the lavage a larger area is sampled, rendering the chance of positive test results higher than in biopsy, it is more likely to find false negative biopsy results. This could lead to a therapy undershoot, which obviates the importance having an alternative for a biopsy.

In addition, considering the fact that a larger area is sampled with lavaging, biopsies may result in more false negative results leading to insufficient therapy.
