]. This review focuses on the imaging of all RMS occurring outside the head and neck region, which comprise 40% of RMS; around 15% are genitourinary (GU) nonbladder prostate tumours (GU-NBP, i.e. paratesticular, vaginal and uterine tumours), 10% are bladder prostate tumours (BP), 15% occur in the limbs, and 20% occur in other sites (i.e. thoracic or abdominal tumours).
Clinical symptoms vary widely, based on the location of the primary tumour, but in general presenting symptoms often are indolent, with nonspecific or minimal symptoms, at the start mimicking innocent general paediatric diseases. Often the duration or progression of symptoms alerts the physician to the presence of a malignant tumour. Site-specific symptoms in GU-NBP tumours are a paratesticular mass in boys that may be painful or not, while girls may present with a grape-like (botryoid) vaginal extrusion of mucosanguineous tissue or micturition problems. BP tumours may present with urinary retention, haematuria, constipation or an abdominal mass. Limb tumours often present with a painless swelling and/or with enlarged regional lymph nodes, while presentation of tumours in other locations may vary from biliary obstruction in tumours of the biliary tract, to painless masses, all depending on their primary site.

The cells are arranged in broad fascicles (fibro-/leiomyosarcoma-like) or in short, interdigitating fascicles (storiform) and whirls with, in contrast to the broad fasciculated variant (leiomyomatous type), an abundant, partly hyalinized collagenous matrix.

Imaging findings
Radiography
As RMS is a soft-tissue tumour, conventional radiology plays an insignificant role in its diagnosis. Localized bony erosion adjacent to the primary site is a recognized complication; this area may be hot on a 99mTc-MDP bone scan in the absence of metastatic disease in the skeleton. In contrast to the initial diagnostic work-up, where for the assessment of pulmonary metastases CT is mandatory, AP and lateral chest radiographs are used in the follow-up period.

Ultrasonography
US is often the first imaging modality used in children with soft-tissue masses because it is readily available, has high resolution, and can easily assess extent and vascularity of a mass. One should not forget that most soft-tissue lesions are benign, can readily be diagnosed with US, and do not need further diagnostic work-up or even treatment.

] systematically reviewed the pathological diagnosis of paediatric tumours from image-guided needle-core biopsies. They concluded that image-guided biopsy material was sufficient to come to a diagnosis in 94% (95%; CI 92–96%) of patients. Complications needing treatment, mostly haemorrhage requiring transfusion, were reported in only 1% of patients. For image-guided biopsies the material obtained should be transported fresh to the pathology department. Fixation should not be performed as this precludes further cytogenetic studies.

CT

]. This comes with the assumption that there is no other medical explanation for these lesions. When there is a high suspicion that a small lesion is metastatic, and appears to be the only site of metastatic disease, biopsy may be performed. In the EpSSG protocol, lung biopsy is not recommended.

MRI

]. Although imaging protocols should be tailored for each individual patient, they should at least consist of axial T1-W and T2-W images (for anatomic detail and assessment of neurovascular structures), T1-W images perpendicular to the axial plane, and imaging after gadolinium administration. It is important that at least two series should be identical, one before and one after contrast agent administration, to be able to discern enhancement. Contrast-enhanced series are mandatory and ideally be performed with fat saturation.

]. Vascular involvement is considered to be absent if there is a normal tissue plane visible between the tumour and the vessel, or if the tumour has a less then a 180° circumferential relationship. If the tumour surrounds the vessel for more than 180°, it is considered to be encased.

]. The authors of both studies concluded that WB-MRI can replace bone scintigraphy. One advantage of this approach would be the implementation of a one-stop-shop approach to childhood RMS. A drawback of MRI in young children is, however, the need for general anaesthesia.

Bone scintigraphy
In the current EpSSG protocols, bone scintigraphy is mandatory as part of the work-up in patients with RMS. The finding of an isolated hot spot on the bone scan should be evaluated with conventional radiography or MRI.

]. However, of these eight patients, six reported bone pain and all had other sites of metastatic disease. The authors conclude that the yield of routine bone scintigraphy is low and that it should be reserved for symptomatic or high-risk patients only.

]. Although in some cases PET-CT has been shown to be of benefit in individual patients, larger prospective studies are needed.


Staging and follow-up
Staging of RMS is of importance for the individual patient as it gives an indication of prognosis, and thus treatment stratification. From a broader perspective staging makes compiling data on larger patient groups for research purposes possible, enabling evaluation of the outcome of different treatment regimens.

The authors concluded that tumour size was underestimated and that in disseminated disease many lesions were either calcified or too small to measure and, therefore, that RECIST are not readily applicable in paediatric oncology. Currently the EpSSG has incorporated RECIST to be used alongside the volumetric measurements in their latest protocol in order to prospectively assess the validity of RECIST in a large patient population with a single tumour type.

Treatment and prognosis
Treatment of RMS requires a multidisciplinary approach, where chemotherapy, surgery and radiotherapy (RT) each has its own specific role.
Chemotherapy
87
88
].

Surgery
In children surgery often starts during the diagnostic phase with biopsy for histological studies, although here interventional radiology plays an increasing role. Excisional biopsy is not advocated except for paratesticular tumours. Most patients end up with postsurgical stage IRS group III. Surgery is generally delayed until after tumour reduction by chemotherapy. The surgical treatment of RMS is site-specific, but the current paradigm is complete wide excision of the primary tumour with a margin of uninvolved tissue whenever possible. Debulking and mutilating procedures should be avoided.

Conclusion
In this review we have discussed the findings of RMS outside the craniofacial region. The treatment of RMS requires a multidisciplinary approach, in which paediatric oncologists, radiologists, paediatric surgeons, pathologists and radiation oncologists all play a vital role. Although they are the most common soft-tissue tumour of childhood, these still rare tumours should be evaluated and treated in specialized centres.
