Previous research has shown that many heterosexuals hold negative attitudes toward homosexuals and homosexuality (homophobia). Although a great deal of research has focused on the profile of homophobic individuals, this research provides little theoretical insight into the aetiology of homophobia. To examine genetic and environmental influences on variation in attitudes toward homophobia, we analysed data from 4,688 twins who completed a questionnaire concerning sexual behaviour and attitudes, including attitudes toward homosexuality. Results show that, in accordance with literature, males have significantly more negative attitudes toward homosexuality than females and non-heterosexuals are less homophobic than heterosexuals. In contrast with some earlier findings, age had no significant effect on the homophobia scores in this study. Genetic modelling showed that variation in homophobia scores could be explained by additive genetic (36%), shared environmental (18%) and unique environmental factors (46%). However, corrections based on previous findings show that the shared environmental estimate may be almost entirely accounted for as extra additive genetic variance arising from assortative mating for homophobic attitudes. The results suggest that variation in attitudes toward homosexuality is substantially inherited, and that social environmental influences are relatively minor.

). Consequently, shared environmental influences on attitudes toward homosexuality can also be expected. Such results would fit the second theory that emphasizes social processes.
Accordingly, the aim of the present study is to determine the contribution of both genes and shared environment to individual differences in attitudes to homosexuality, using data from a large twin sample. Findings will result in further insight into the aetiology of variation in homophobia.

Methodology
Participants
All participants were drawn from the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council Twin Registry (ATR). Subjects for this study were recruited in two phases from a large twin-family study of alcohol use and abuse.
N
 = 4,269, aged between 18 and 25 years) participating in an extensive Health and Lifestyle Questionnaire (HLQ) were asked whether they were willing to participate in an anonymous study about sexual behaviour and attitudes. All those who agreed were mailed the sex questionnaire between July 1991 and October 1992. To ensure anonymity, twins were not asked about their name or date of birth, but to make up a 10 digit number. Both twins of a pair had to use the same number, which made it possible to connect the responses of both twins. Additionally, informed consent was obtained separate from the questionnaires.
2000
).
In total, 1,907 complete pairs and 1,090 twins from incomplete pairs completed the questionnaire (1,824 male and 3,080 female individuals). However, due to missing data and ambiguous zygosities the effective study sample used for the homophobia analyses is lower than 4,904, as described in the result section.

Zygosity
1990
1975
), concurrence on zygosity between discriminant analyses of questionnaire scores and DNA typing is at least 95% and telephone clarification will have increased accuracy. In the present study the zygosity of the twin pairs was premarked on their questionnaire and the twins were asked whether they did or did not agreed with the assessment.

Measures

). Each item showed a high factor loading for both males and females (between 0.55 and 0.87).
Accordingly, in the present study homophobia was measured using the 10 items of this Attitudes to Homosexuality scale, which comprised statements like ‘Homosexuality is obscene and vulgar’, and ‘Homosexual men should be allowed to work as schoolteachers’ (see Appendix A for the total scale). Twins were asked to either tick YES if they agreed with the statement or NO if they disagreed. If a participant filled out both answers on an item (both YES and NO), the item was coded as missing. To enhance unbiased answering, a preamble to the section explained that there are no right or wrong answers and no trick questions and they were encouraged to work quickly and not to think too long about the exact meaning of questions.
1999
). Missing values were substituted with values from other cases with similar response patterns, but without missing data. Note that it was only possible to impute items in PRELIS if participants had only one missing value and that imputation depended on the response patterns from other cases. A total of 109 responses were imputed (0.2% of the total item responses), increasing the available twins for structural equation modelling from 4,442 to 4,551, a gain of 2.5% in the total available sample size.
N
N
 = 101) responses were included in further analyses. Their homophobia score was corrected by adding their mean item score for each missing item. This resulted in another gain of 4.8% of the available sample size.
As the distribution of the homophobia data showed significant skewness and kurtosis, scores were grouped into four ordinal categories with roughly equal sample sizes. Individuals scoring 0 on the continuous scale were given an ordinal score of 0, while individuals scoring 1 or 2 were given score 1, individuals scoring 3–6 score 2, and individuals scoring 7–10 score 3.
To determine the participants’ sexual orientation, twins were asked the following question in another part of the questionnaire, called ‘Sexual Feelings and Behaviour’: Do you consider yourself to be heterosexual (straight), bisexual or homosexual (lesbian or gay)? For the present study, sexual orientation was only subdivided into heterosexual and non-heterosexual. The latter includes both bisexual and homosexual individuals.

Data analysis
1989
). For these analyses it is assumed that there is an underlying continuum of liability which is normally distributed in the population. Upon this normal distribution three thresholds are placed to delimit the four categories. Variation in liability can be modelled as a function of genetic and environmental influences.

 test.
To determine the effects of age, sexual orientation and sex on the thresholds, different (nested) submodels are tested against a full model, in which all parameters were estimated. By looking for differences in model fit after constraining these effects to zero in a stepwise manner, the significance of parameters that contribute to explaining differences in thresholds can be determined.
Heterogeneity of twin pair correlations is tested by determining the change in model fit when twin pair correlations (for sex and/or zygosity) were equated.

). It should be noted however that the distribution of age in this study was highly skewed, with the majority of participants (70.9%) in age group 19–35 and only 29.1% of all participants aged between 35 and 52 years.
The aim of the present study was to determine the contribution of genes and environment to individual differences in attitudes toward homosexuality. Based on the general ACE model, estimates of the influence of A, C and E on the variance in homophobia scores are: 36%, 18% and 46%. However, although no significant qualitative and quantitative differences in sources of variation between males and females were found, twin pair correlations do suggest possible differences between the sexes. Under a general sex-limitation model, estimates of the influence of A and C on variation in homophobia scores are 38% and 23% for males and 23% and 28% for females, respectively. The additive genetic correlation for the DZ opposite sex twins is estimated at 0.09, considerably lower than the 0.5 assumed for DZ same sex twins. This finding would suggest that genes influencing homophobia in males are to a large extent different from those in females. However, since both A and C effects are present in both sexes, the parameterisation of sex limitation as genetic in origin is arbitrary. If it were parameterised as a lower common environmental correlation between males and females, the same model fit would be obtained. Moreover, there could be sex limitation of both A and C influences, but since there is only one degree of freedom to estimate them—obtained from the DZ opposite sex twin pair correlation—the two are completely confounded. In either case, differences in saliency of homosexuality between males and females make it unsurprising that there are distinct causes of variation in homophobia in the two sexes.

After correction, the contribution of shared environment on individual differences in homophobia scores falls from 0.18 to 0.03, while the genetic estimate increases to about 0.51. This finding suggests that variation in attitudes toward homosexuality is substantially inherited, while social environmental influences are relatively minor.
When applying the assortative mating correction to the results of the general sex-limitation model, the contribution of shared environment on individual differences in homophobia scores for males falls from 0.23 to 0.04 and for females from 0.28 to 0.24, while the genetic estimate increases to about 0.57 for males and 0.27 for females. As such, based on the general sex-limitation model familial aggregation for homophobia scores for males might be almost totally accounted for by genetic effects, while for females both genes and shared environment seem to have about equal effects. If this would be the case, and there is little or no C influence on homophobia scores for males, sex limitation for homophobia scores can only have a genetic origin.

). Although the effect of sexual orientation on homophobia is large at the individual level, the percentage of non-heterosexuals is so low, it accounts for only a trivial proportion of population variance in attitudes to homosexuality.
There are a few important methodological limitations to be considered for this study. As already mentioned, the most important limitation of this study was a lack of statistical power. Although the sample size is fairly large, due to the fact that the homophobia scale had to be analysed as ordinal data, it is still insufficient. Neale et al. (2004) showed that for a threshold study at least three times the sample size needed for equivalent power to a study using continuous data is required.

) have examined this question for the survey used in the current study by comparing the social, psychological and behavioural features of the twins who explicitly consented to join the present study (52%) with those who either explicitly refused (27%) or initially agreed, but subsequently did not return the consent forms (19%). Results indicate that those individuals who explicitly consented had less conservative sexual attitudes and were more likely to agree with gay rights. However, the effect sizes of these findings were small, indicating the participation bias probably did not influence the results to a great extent.
Another limitation to consider is the possibility of socially desirable responding. Although it is not possible to exclude social desirability effects, twins were encouraged to be honest by guaranteeing anonymity and by asking them to fill out the questionnaire while alone with sufficient privacy.
In summary, this study concerning the aetiology of homophobic attitudes revealed that familial aggregation in attitudes toward homosexuality is accounted for by genes as well as by shared environmental factors. However, when the plausible effect of assortative mating on our estimates is taken into account, familial aggregation for homophobia scores might be almost totally accounted for by genetic effects. More research is necessary to further unravel the sources of variance in homophobia and to determine whether these differ between sexes. This future research will need greater sample sizes—preferably including spouses—and should analyse attitudes toward male and female homosexuals separately. It will also be of interest to compare prejudice toward homosexuals with prejudice toward other targets (like racism and sexism), to see to what extent similar results will be obtained and whether the same genetic and environmental sources explain individual differences in prejudice toward different out-groups.
