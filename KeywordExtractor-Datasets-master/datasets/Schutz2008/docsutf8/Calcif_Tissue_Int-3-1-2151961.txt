Purpose
To investigate the impact of the Ala1330Val (rs3736228, exon 18) and Val667Met (rs4988321, exon 9) polymorphisms of the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5 (LRP5) gene on peak bone mass in young men.

Methods
The Odense Androgen Study (OAS) is a population-based study comprising 783 Caucasian men aged 20-30 years. Genotyping was performed using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or fluorescence polarization. Bone mineral density (BMD) measurements were performed using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry.

Results

Conclusion
The Ala1330Val and Val667Met polymorphisms in the LRP5 gene are significantly associated with peak bone mass in physically active men.

In the present study, we investigated the association between the Ala1330Val and Val667Met polymorphisms and peak bone mass in men in a population-based study.
Subjects and Methods
24
]. In brief, 3,000 men aged 20–30 years were randomly selected from the civil registration database in Fuenen County, Denmark, and invited by mail to participate in the study. These subjects also received a questionnaire regarding smoking, medication, chronic diseases, drug abuse, etc. A total of 2,042 questionnaires were returned, and from these 859 men expressed interest in participation in the clinical part of the study. Nineteen withdrew before an appointment for inclusion was made. Ten men did not meet with the inclusion criteria (Caucasian and age between 20–29 years), and another 3 men gave their notice after the inclusion had stopped. Aside from these latecomers none of the responders were excluded. Of the remaining 827 eligible subjects, 43 did not attend for their appointment and did not wish to reschedule, but informed consent was obtained from 784 men, with dropout from 1 subject. Thus 783 Caucasian men gave written informed consent and were included in the OAS. These participants had similar age, body mass index (BMI), lifestyle, socio-economic status, and educational level as the background population, as evaluated by questionnaires and demographic data (manuscript in preparation). The protocol stipulated that subjects with massive substance or alcohol abuse, malignant disease or severe chronic disease be excluded; however, none of the responders fulfilled any of these criteria. The study was approved by the local Ethics Committee of Fuenen and Vejle Counties (file number 20010198), conducted according to the Helsinki Declaration, and declared in ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00150163, registered September 6, 2005.
Genotyping
DNA was isolated from whole blood samples using QIAamp DNA Blood Midi kits (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA).
Sense: 5′-GACGGCGAGGCAGACTGT-3′

Antisense: 5′-GCAGGGCCAGGGTCTTG-3′

C probe: 5′-FAM-TCAAAGTCCGCCTCGT-NFQ-3′

T probe: 5′-VIC-CACAGTCCACCTCGTC-NFQ-3′


The real-time analysis was performed using the ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detection System. To validate the method, approximately 10% of the samples were repeated and in total 17 samples—at least 5 of each genotype—were sequenced.
25
Sense: 5-gccTTcTTggTcTTcAccAg-3′

Antisense: 5′-cTTTgAggcAggAAcAgAgg-3′


Enzymatic clean-up and subsequent AcycloPrime-FP reaction with SNP primer (sense 5′-ccTcgAgAccAATAAcAAcgAc-3′) were performed according to the instructions of the kit manufacturer. Fluorescence polarization was read in a Wallac Victor multilabel plate reader (Perkin Elmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA, USA). Blank samples and samples with known genotype were included as negative and positive controls, respectively. A total of 10% of all samples were sequenced and genotyping confirmed in all cases.

Anthropometrics and Lifestyle
Body weight, body height, sitting height, and arm span were measured. Data regarding exercise habits were collected using a self-administered questionnaire. Non-sedentary lifestyle was defined as participation in any form of regular exercise.

Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA)
BMD of the lumbar spine, hip, and whole-body was measured using a Hologic 4500 DXA-scanner (Waltham, MA, USA). The coefficient of variation (CV) for BMD is 1.5%, 1.5%, and 0.7% in the lumbar spine, total hip, and whole body, respectively. Lean body mass (LBM) and fat mass was obtained from the whole-body scans.

Biochemistry
Serum samples were drawn after an overnight fast between 08.00 and 10.00 hours and stored for later analyses at −80°C. Serum concentrations of osteocalcin were measured by a luminoimmunoassay (BRAHMS Diagnostica, Berlin, Germany) with an intra-assay and inter-assay CV of 5% and 8%, respectively.

Similarly, the GG, GA, AA genotypes of the Val667Met polymorphism were found in 699 (89.7%), 76 (9.8%), and 4 (0.5%), respectively. This corresponds to allele frequencies of 0.95 and 0.05 for the G- and A-alleles, respectively.

]. It is presently unclear why association between the Ala1330Val and Val667Met genotypes and BMD was found only in the spine and not in the hip in the non-sedentary group. Differences between the skeletal sites regarding loading pattern (compression vs. bending) and bone architecture (trabecular vs. cortical) may be important.

]. Second, our population had a relatively homogeneous genetic background both due to a small influx to our population and since participants with a first- or second-generation immigrant background were excluded on the basis on data from our national registry. Third, we selected young men aged 20–30 years since these were expected to have reached their peak bone mass. This was confirmed by our data demonstrating an infinitesimal decrease in BMD by age. Moreover, very few were afflicted with chronic diseases or had long-term exposure of environmental factors that may affect bone mass.
We conclude that the Ala1330Val (exon 18) and Val667Met (exon 9) polymorphisms of the LRP5 gene are significantly associated with lumbar spine peak bone mass in physically active men, potentially accounting for 2.5% of BMD in the spine. This gene-environment interaction provides support for LRP5 as a mediator of load-induced bone formation and suggests that this gene is involved in the pathogenesis of osteoporosis in men.
