 intake may contribute to preventing postmenopausal bone loss.

Introduction
Vitamin K is involved in the synthesis of several proteins in bone. The importance of K vitamins for optimal bone health has been suggested by population-based studies, but intervention studies with DXA-BMD as a clinical endpoint have shown contradicting results. Unlike BMC, DXA-BMD does not take into account the geometry (size, thickness) of bone, which has an independent contribution to bone strength and fracture risk. Here we have tested whether BMC and femoral neck width are affected by high vitamin K intake.

Methods
2
 (MK-4, menatetrenone) during three years. BMC and hip geometry were assessed by DXA. Bone strength indices were calculated from DXA-BMD, femoral neck width (FNW) and hip axis length (HAL).

Results
2
2
-treated group hip bone strength remained unchanged during the 3-year intervention period, whereas in the placebo group bone strength decreased significantly.

Conclusions
2
 helps maintaining bone strength at the site of the femoral neck in postmenopausal women by improving BMC and FNW, whereas it has little effect on DXA-BMD.

 and MK-4, recently also the natural MK-7 has become available. The recommended daily intake of vitamin K (all forms) is between 100 and 120 μg/day, but this value is based on the hepatic vitamin K requirement for blood clotting factor synthesis. The requirements of other tissues have not yet been defined, but are probably higher.

]. A potential bias in these studies is that low circulating vitamin K may be a marker for general poor nutritional status and that low DXA-BMD and increased fracture risk are associated with the combined deficiency of essential minerals, vitamins and proteins rather than with vitamin K alone.

 on DXA-BMD and bone strength indices in postmenopausal women, who were recruited from the apparently healthy population and thus represent the large group of free living elderly subjects. Additional or synergistic effects of calcium and vitamin D were not included in the design of our study.

Subjects and methods
Subjects
The study was designed for apparently healthy, non-osteoporotic women. Participants were recruited by local newspapers. Inclusion criteria were female gender, age between 55 and 75 years at intake, Caucasian race, apparently healthy, at least 2 years postmenopausal and willingness to sign informed consent. Exclusion criteria were: a history of metabolic bone disease(s) or recent bone fractures (less than one year), low bone density (T-score < −2.5), ovariectomy, hysterectomy, oral anticoagulant treatment, hormone replacement therapy, treatment with bisphosphonates, calcitonin, prednisone, heparin, or vitamin K-containing vitamin concentrates and food supplements. Also subjects who had received an investigational new drug within the last 12 months were excluded from the trial. In total 325 women met the criteria and were randomized into our study. The participants were pre-stratified according to age: 105 in the age of 55–65 years, and 220 in the age of 65–75 years. The study protocol was approved by the University Hospital medical ethics committee.

Masking
Participants were identified by a single randomization number according to the randomization schedule generated by the University Hospital Pharmacy using a computer-generated random permutation procedure in the software package SPSS. Participants were randomly assigned to treatment with either 45 mg/day of MK-4 (menatetrenone, EISAI Co, Tokyo, Japan) or placebo, and compliance with treatment was decided from pill counts during home visits. The daily dose of MK-4 was given in three capsules of 15 mg each, which had to be taken at three time points spread over the day, preferably after the meal. The participant randomization codes were allocated sequentially in the order in which the participants were enrolled. After completion of all analyses the randomization code was disclosed to the investigator.

Sample collection
Fasting blood was taken and 2-h fasting urine was collected at baseline and after 3, 6, 12 and 36 months of treatment. After blood was taken, it was allowed to clot at room temperature for half an hour. Serum was prepared after centrifugation at 3,000 rpm, during 15 minutes. It was subdivided in small aliquots and kept at −80°C until use. Urine was collected as the second morning void after an overnight fast.

Statistics
The required numbers of participants in both age groups were assessed using separate power analyses (power of 90% and a significance level of 0.05). In the younger age group it was assumed that in the placebo group the mean bone loss is approximately 1.5% (4.5% in 3 years). The lowest detectable effect was set at an improvement of 30% (=3.15% bone loss after 3 years). Taking into account a drop-out frequency of 12% per year this group should consist of at least 76 subjects. In the older age group the mean bone loss was assumed to amount 1% per year (3% in 3 years). With a lowest detectable effect of 30% (=2.1% bone loss in 3 years) and a drop-out frequency of 19% per year, the minimal size of this group is 218 subjects.
Statistical analysis was performed using the statistical package SPSS (SPSS Corp, Chicago, IL). The calculations are based on the intention-to-treat principle. Drop-outs were included in the analyses, with the last data available in all subsequent measuring points. All follow-up measurements were related to the baseline values and the proportional changes were calculated for each subject. Differences between and within the different groups were assessed with the unpaired and paired Student’s t-test, respectively. All data are given as mean values ±SE. The linear regression model was used to investigate the effect of treatment after adjustment for potential confounders. Change of FNW, HAL and bone strength indices after 3 years of treatment were used as dependent variables and age and BMI as independent variables.

The differences in all age-related variables were highly significant. All data are given±SE.



After 3 years 257 women had completed the study: 133 women in the MK-4 group and 124 women in the placebo group. In total 68 women stopped during the study. This was 21% of the total. The largest group of participants (n = 30) stopped during the first 3 months of the trial. The most important reasons for discontinuation in this time period were various health problems (n = 18), low DXA-BMD (n = 17), lack of motivation (n = 10) and complaints about the capsules (n = 9). Subjects who stopped because of low DXA-BMD did so after consultation during the trial with their general practitioner; there were two complaints about the capsules in the MK-4 group and seven in the placebo group. Two participants died during the trial: one brain tumor and one cerebrovascular accident. Both casualties were in the placebo group. In total, 36 negative or positive side effects were mentioned by the participants. In the MK-4 group 16 women experienced negative effects and four experienced positive effects of the capsules; in the placebo group the numbers were 15 and one, respectively. The most frequent negative effects were gain of weight and gastro-intestinal complaints. However, there was no difference in total numbers of complaints between the MK-4 and the placebo group.

]. Both factors may contribute to the total bone strength. Hence studies in which DXA-BMD is the only clinical endpoint do not give conclusive evidence on bone strength. If, for instance, the femoral neck DXA-BMD remains constant but increases in width the bone will become stronger and more resistant to fracture. Therefore, we have used mathematical procedures for calculating three indices for bone strength at the site of the femoral neck.
