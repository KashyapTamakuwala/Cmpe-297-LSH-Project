Obesity, reduced physical activity and ageing are well known risk factors for type 2 diabetes. However, all individuals exposed to an affluent environment do not develop the disease. One likely reason is that genetic variation modifies individual susceptibility to the environment. However, the environment could also modify genetic risk factors by influencing expression of a gene by DNA methylation or histone modifications. Cytosine residues occurring in CG dinucleotides are targets for DNA methylation and gene expression is usually reduced when DNA methylation takes place at a promoter. Whether DNA methylation influences gene expression in target tissues for type 2 diabetes and thereby the pathogenesis of the disease remains to be demonstrated.

]. After isolation, islets were cultured free floating in M199 culture medium (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) at 5.5 mmol/l glucose concentration and studied within 3 days from isolation. Cell viability, measured by Trypan Blue exclusion, was higher than 90% in control and diabetic islets after 3 days in culture.

]. Following a 45 min pre-incubation period at 3.3 mmol/l glucose, groups of 30 islets of comparable size were kept at 37°C for 45 min in KRB, 0.5% (wt/wt) albumin, pH 7.4, containing 3.3 mmol/l glucose. At the end of this period, the medium was completely removed and replaced with KRB containing either 3.3, 16.7 or 3.3 mmol/l glucose plus 20 mmol/l arginine, or 3.3 mmol/l glucose plus 100 μmol/l glibenclamide. After an additional 45 min incubation period, the medium was removed. Media (500 μl aliquots from the 10 ml incubation volume) were stored at −20°C until insulin concentrations were measured by immunoradiometric assay (Pantec Forniture Biomediche, Turin, Italy).

 (Assays-on-demands, human, Hs00173304_m1 and rat, Rn00580241_A1; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) were used. Each sample was run in duplicate and the transcript quantity was normalised to the mRNA level of cyclophilin A (human, 4326316E and rat Rn00574762_A1; Applied Biosystems). For each probe/primer set, a standard curve was generated, which was confirmed to increase linearly with increasing amounts of cDNA.

At the end of the incubation period well volume was doubled with M199 culture medium and samples were kept in the incubator for another 48 h, when islets function, viability, transfection efficiency (60% when measured by Polyfectamine tied to a fluorescent probe) and gene expression were evaluated.

Discussion
PPARGC1A
PPARGC1A
PPARGC1A
PPARGC1A
 expression in human islets by siRNA resulted in decreased insulin secretion thereby demonstrating a causal link between PGC-1α levels and insulin secretion. Based on these observations we propose a model where combinations of genetic and epigenetic factors can influence the level of PGC-1α in human islets and subsequently glucose-stimulated insulin secretion.

 expression correlated with impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, which is known to require ATP. Thereby, the present study provides two novel insights into the molecular mechanisms of islet dysfunction in type 2 diabetes; first that a master transcription regulator of oxidative phosphorylation, PGC-1α, may be involved and second, that epigenetic factors like DNA methylation should be considered when searching for the genetic causes of type 2 diabetes.
