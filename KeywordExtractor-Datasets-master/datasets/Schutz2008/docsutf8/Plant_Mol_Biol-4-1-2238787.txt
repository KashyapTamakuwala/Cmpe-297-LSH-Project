 under the control of the Cauliflower Mosaic Virus 35S promoter were generated and found to exhibit improved tolerance to diverse abiotic stresses when compared to wild type plants. Expression patterns of various stress responsive genes were enhanced, and the activities of anti-oxidative enzymes were elevated in transgenic plants, suggesting a possible involvement of AtIpk2β in plant stress responses.

 After two days of co-cultivation, the explants were transferred to regeneration medium containing 1-mg/l BAP, 0.1-mg/l NAA, 50-mg/l hygromycin and 200-mg/l ampicillin. Regenerated shoots were separated from the calli and transferred onto rooting medium containing MS salts, 0.1-mg/l NAA and 50-mg/l hygromycin. Rooted shoots were transplanted into soil. Seeds were harvested and homozygous plants were screened on a 12-h light/12-h dark photoperiod.

Whole plant drought tolerance test
Wild type and transgenic plant seeds were surface sterilized as described above. Seedlings germinated on MS medium were transplanted to soil. After two months, healthy plants of the same size and age were pooled into two groups. For the first group (12 individual plants, each grown in a 6.5-inch pot), plants were irrigated with 60 g/l PEG-6000 to simulate drought stress. After 21 days, the plants were photographed. Simultaneously, plants of the second group were subjected to drought stress by omitting watering. After three weeks, the plants were re-hydrated and observed for recovery. Photos were taken 21 days after initiation of the stress treatment. The relative humidity was maintained at ∼60%. The experiments were repeated twice with three replicates in each experiment.

Freezing tolerance test
Three-week-old seedlings of wild type and transgenic plants grown on MS medium were cultured at 4°C for one day under long day condition (16-h light/8-h dark). After cold acclimation, the plants were left at −20°C for 1 or 2 h, transferred immediately to 4°C for another 12 h (overnight). Subsequently, plants were kept in the greenhouse at 25°C and observed further. Photographs were taken seven days after initiation of the recovery growth in the greenhouse.

) Two-week-old seedlings of wild type and transgenic lines (S13, S15) were used for RNA extraction. For the salt stress experiments, seedlings were treated with 300-mM NaCl for 5 h before RNA isolation. The transcriptional levels of five stress genes were determined by RT-PCR analyses. The stress genes used for the tests are as follows: lipid transfer protein (AY562132); fructose-bisphosphate aldolase (AY554169); raffinose synthase family protein/seed imbibition protein (AY554170); group 2 LEA proteins NtERD 10B (AB049336) and NtERD 10C (AB049337)
