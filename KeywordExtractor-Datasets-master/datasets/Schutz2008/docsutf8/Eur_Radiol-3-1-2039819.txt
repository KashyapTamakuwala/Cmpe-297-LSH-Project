Coronary fly-through or virtual angioscopy (VA) has been studied ever since its invention in 2000. However, application was limited because it requires an optimal computed tomography (CT) scan and time-consuming post-processing. Recent advances in post-processing software facilitate easy construction of VA, but until now image quality was insufficient in most patients. The introduction of dual-source multidetector CT (MDCT) could enable VA in all patients. Twenty patients were scanned using a dual-source MDCT (Definition, Siemens, Forchheim, Germany) using a standard coronary artery protocol. Post-processing was performed on an Aquarius Workstation (TeraRecon, San Mateo, Calif.). Length travelled per major branch was recorded in millimetres, together with the time required in minutes. VA could be performed in every patient for each of the major coronary arteries. The mean (range) length of the automated fly-through was 80 (32–107) mm for the left anterior descending (LAD), 75 (21–116) mm for the left circumflex artery (LCx), and 109 (21–190) mm for the right coronary artery (RCA). Calcifications and stenoses were visualised, as well as most side branches. The mean time required was 3 min for LAD, 2.5 min for LCx, and 2 min for the RCA. Dual-source MDCT allows for high quality visualisation of the coronary arteries in every patient because scanning with this machine is independent of the heart rate. This is clearly shown by the successful VA in all patients. Potential clinical value of VA should be determined in the near future.

Materials and methods
Twenty patients (13 male, mean age 60 ± 13 years old) were selected at random from patients scanned for coronary artery disease using a standard coronary artery protocol on a dual source MDCT (Definition, Siemens, Forchheim, Germany).

Results
VA could be performed semi-automatically with minor user interaction in every patient for each of the major coronary arteries using dual-source CT (DSCT).
The mean (range) length of the automated fly-through was 80 (32–107) mm for the left anterior descending (LAD), 75 (21–116) mm for the left circumflex artery (LCx), and 109 (21–190) mm for the RCA.

]. They all state that the coronary fly-through or virtual coronary angioscopy (VCA) is a promising technique that, however, requires higher quality of the datasets and better image processing software.
A shortcoming of our study was the lack of a “gold standard” to confirm the findings of the coronary fly-through.

Conclusion
Dual-source MDCT provides a high quality visualisation of the coronary artery tree, independently of the heart rate. This is clearly shown by the successful VCA in all 20 patients in this study. With recent advancements of image processing software and CT acquisition techniques, the conditions have been met for providing the technical basis for the clinical validation of VCA and the potential clinical value of VCA should be determined in the near future.
