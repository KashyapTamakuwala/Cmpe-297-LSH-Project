In this review we start with a historical perspective beginning with the early morphological work done almost 50 years ago. The importance of these pioneering studies is underscored by our brief summary of the key questions addressed by subsequent research into the mechanism of secretion. We then highlight important advances in our understanding of the formation and maturation of neuroendocrine secretory granules, first using in vitro reconstitution systems, then most recently biochemical approaches, and finally genetic manipulations in vitro and in vivo.

Morphological era of discovery (1950s and 1960s)
Visualization of the cell interior by electron microscopy catalysed both morphologists and biochemists to initiate experiments and make observations to identify, define and understand the complex compartmentalization of specialized cells, most notably including the morphologists G.E. Palade, C. DeDuve, D.W. Fawcett, K.R. Porter, J. Rhodin and F.S. Sjostrand. The exocrine pancreatic acinar was a specialized cell type favoured by GE Palade, and it was with this cell type that the first observations on cells with specialized granule compartments were made.

Many of the observations made were obtained using careful morphological approaches and expanded using biochemical techniques, and subcellular fractionation. However, these early biochemical approaches were limited by the inability to manipulate the cell systems in use, typically tissues from mice or rats. The arrival of molecular tools and genetic manipulation provided the next wave of advances bringing the field to our current level of understanding.

Both the “sorting for entry” and “sorting by retention” hypothesis agree on that non-regulated (possibly mis-sorted) secretory proteins are removed by ISG-specific clathrin-coated vesicles in a pathway called “constitutive-like secretion”, after secretory granules have formed from the TGN.

Determination of the pH of ISGs using an in vitro approach
1995
35
S] sulfate labelling demonstrated that SgII was proteolytically processed by PC2 in ISGs after approximately 30 min of chase into several lower-molecular-mass proteins, the major ones being a 18 and 28 kDa sulphated fragment.
1997
35
S] sulfate pulse-labelled SgII were incubated in presence of ATP at physiological pH and the extent of SgII processing in these compartments was compared to a standard curve prepared using ISGs equilibrated at a defined set of pHs. This allowed us to determine that the ISGs intra-granular pH was 6.3, similar to the TGN pH and clearly higher than the pH of MSGs (pH 5.5–5.0). Interestingly, no processing of SgII could be observed in the membrane fraction highly enriched in TGN under conditions for which processing was readily obtained in isolated ISGs. This data represent further evidence that the ISG is indeed a functionally distinct organelle from the TGN. Furthermore, the rate of SgII processing was strongly dependent on the intragranular pH, demonstrating that processing of SgII can be used as a pH indicator for granule interior.

ISG-ISG homotypic fusion
1966
1991
), ISGs increase in size during maturation, and the increase in size was proposed to reflect homotypic fusion of ISG. To demonstrate that ISG–ISG fusion occurred, we developed an assay that provided the first biochemical evidence for such a fusion event and allowed us to dissect the molecular requirements of this process.

ISG membrane remodelling
In addition to ISG-ISG homotypic fusion, ISG content and membrane remodelling is another important step during granule maturation. This remodelling is performed via budding of clathrin-coated vesicle from the maturing granule membrane, and is the pathway for non-regulated constitutive-like secretion, or possibly sorting to endosomes. This clathrin-mediated remodelling step is a common feature in neuroendocrine and endocrine secretory granules, and is thought to provide a mechanism for proof-reading the content and membrane composition of the maturing ISG to ensure the production of MSGs which contain biologically active hormones and can undergo efficient exocytosis.

Role of cholesterol in secretory granule biogenesis
2000
2006
). Both diseases are a result of inborn errors in cholesterol synthesis. SLOS is a disease caused by a defect in the function of the enzyme, 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase (DHCR7), required for the final step of cholesterol biosynthesis. Patients with lathosterolosis lack lathosterol-5-desaturase (SC5D), the enzyme that catalyse the next-to-last step in cholesterol synthesis. Data obtained from DHCR7 and SC5D knock-out mice demonstrated that impairment of the cholesterol biosynthesis results in a significant decrease in secretory granules in pancreas, pituitary and adrenal glands. In addition, abberant zymogen granules were found in the exocrine pancreas, in which there was also observed a decrease in regulated secretion which could be rescued with exogenous cholesterol. The authors conclude that the presence of an elevated quantity of other sterols, 7-DHC and lathosterol, in Dhcr7-/- and Sc5d-/- mice, respectively, could not replace cholesterol in the regulated secretory pathway. They speculate that the abnormal properties of the secretory granule in these mice models may be attributed to the reduced rigidity of membranes containing these sterols instead of cholesterol. Importantly, this study demonstrates that cholesterol is essential during secretory granule biogenesis in vivo.

Regulation of secretory granule maturation

2007
). Overexpression of their N-terminal GEF domain enhances secretion from ISGs, reducing regulated secretory protein storage through constitutive-like secretion, in the absence of secretagogue stimulation of regulated exocytosis. Conversely, when GEF activity is inhibited the constitutive-like release is inhibited, resulting in the accumulation of cargo in MSGs above even normal levels. These results indicate that these two Rho-GEFs regulate sorting into secretory granules, constitutive-like secretion from ISGs, and perhaps constitutive secretion, and provide a novel mechanism for the regulation of secretory granule maturation.

Role of Chromogranin A in secretory granule formation

) is not simply conferred by expression of CgA.
2001
2004
) refuted the hypothesis by demonstrating with very similar approaches that the “newly formed” vesicles which contained the CgA were in fact lysosomes, and overexpression of CgA did not induce the appearance of secretory granules, or alter the number of secretory granules.
2005
2005
). In the adrenal medulla of these mice there was a large decrease in the number of secretory granules; in addition it was noted that the secretory granules present appeared to be swollen. This defect may be related to a need to maintain a proportional catecholamine and CgA concentrations.
2006
) found that the CgA null mutant mice had elevated secretion of epinephrine, norepinephrine and dopamine and that mRNA and protein level of other secretory granule proteins were up-regulated. No obvious abnormalities in development or neuronal and endocrine functions have been noticed. The authors suggested then that the increased expression of the other Granin family members is likely to compensate for the CgA deficiency.

Role of prohormone convertases in secretory granule maturation
Both in vitro and ex vivo the activity of the PC enzymes (notably PC1/3 and PC2 which will be the focus of the discussion here) have been extensively studied. PC null mice models have confirmed the in vivo function of the PCs and extended the characterization of their specific substrates and action in different tissues.

2002
). In summary, the analysis of PC2, 7B2 and PC1/3 null mice has confirmed that PCs play a crucial role in the processing of many hormone precursors and the highlight the importance of PC2 and PC1/3 in neuroendocrine tissues, and regulated secretion.

Role of Rab3D in secretory granule maturation
1994
2000
1997
).
In contrast to Rab3A, Rab3B and Rab3C, Rab3D is predominantly expressed outside the nervous system, in peripheral tissues where the other isoforms either are expressed at low levels or are lacking. Originally identified in fat cells, Rab3D is present in several additional cell types including secretory cells such as pancreatic and parotid acinar cells, mast cells and peptide-secreting cell lines. In secretory cells Rab3D appears to be predominantly localized to secretory granules, thus mirroring the distribution of Rab3A in neurons and neuroendocrine cells. It was hypothesised that Rab3D could have the same function as Rab3A but in secretory cells.
2002
) investigated the role of this Rab3 isoform by knocking out the Rab3D gene in mice. Rab3D-deficient mice are viable and fertile and showed no obvious defect. In particular, both kinetics and dose response of secretagogue-induced enzyme secretion of the pancreas were normal. However, these mice show a substantially increased size of secretory granules in both exocrine pancreas and the parotid gland with the volume being doubled, while the intragranular protein concentration appears to be unchanged. These data suggest that Rab3D functions in granule maturation but not in exocytic membrane fusion.


Conclusions and future perspectives
The early morphological and biochemical characterization of the regulated secretory pathway provided key insights to the secretory process. More recent experiments have provided a more detailed understanding of the functional properties, and the regulation of the maturation of neuroendocrine secretory granules. Many important issues need to be resolved, for example how the cytoplasmic events, such as membrane remodelling are coupled with the intralumenal biochemical changes such as PC activation, prohormone cleavage, and acidification. In addition, the biological relevance of the maturation process, as it affects hormone processing and secretion, remains to be determined in light of the differences between endocrine and neuroendocrine granules.
