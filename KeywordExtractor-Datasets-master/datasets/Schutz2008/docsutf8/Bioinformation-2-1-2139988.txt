		Effective treatment of diabetes is increasingly dependent on active constituents of medicinal plants capable of controlling hyperglycemia as well as its secondary 
		complications. Sensing the importance of documenting such medicinal plants, here we describe a web database containing information (name, literature citation, active 
		compounds and few related full text articles) of the diabetes medicinal plants exhibiting hypoglycemic, antioxidant and antimicrobial effects.

] Our interest is to study these anti diabetic medicinal plants. Research findings suggest that many 
of these plants control diabetes by exhibiting hypoglycemic and antioxidant effects. The secondary infections associated with diabetes are also restricted to antimicrobial effect by 
plant products. Sensing the opportunities provided and in an effort to translate research into technology, this database ‘DIAB’ was created to document the research literature 
available on these medicinal plants and their active compounds.

] and also from folklore medicinal usage. The current dataset contains information for about 
258 genus and 287 species of plants exhibiting antidiabetic effect. Of these 287 antidiabetic plants, 129 species show proven antioxidant effect and 53 species exhibit 
antimicrobial effect besides their hypoglycemic activity.

Step 2: Database Design
The database is developed using MS Access as back-end and ASP.NET as front-end on a Windows platform and updated regularly.

Utility
In the current scenario there are several other databases which give information on medicinal plant name, distribution, drugs formulated and usage in treatment of diabetes. We believe 
that the freely available database called DIAB will give supplementary information on the antidiabetic plants capable of controlling some secondary complications. This database finds 
utility to the scientific community for a quick review on plants for diabetes medicinal plant research and provides enormous scope for development of drugs.

Future development
We plan to refine and keep updating this database and hopefully a link solely for indigenous plants will be made available in the nearest future. The database will also be modified 
to develop provisions to search the database to identify plants of interest using keywords.
