Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) shares a genetic basis with motor coordination problems and probably motor timing problems. In line with this, comparable problems in motor timing should be observed in first degree relatives and might, therefore, form a suitable endophenotypic candidate. This hypothesis was investigated in 238 ADHD-families (545 children) and 147 control-families (271 children). A motor timing task was administered, in which children had to produce a 1,000 ms interval. In addition to this task, two basic motor tasks were administered to examine speed and variability of motor output, when no timing component was required. Results indicated that variability in motor timing is a useful endophenotypic candidate: It was clearly associated with ADHD, it was also present in non-affected siblings, and it correlated within families. Accuracy (under- versus over-production) in motor timing appeared less useful: Even though accuracy was associated with ADHD (probands and affected siblings had a tendency to under-produce the 1,000 ms interval compared to controls), non-affected siblings did not differ from controls and sibling correlations were only marginally significant. Slow and variable motor output without timing component also appears present in ADHD, but not in non-affected siblings, suggesting these deficits not to be related to a familial vulnerability for ADHD. Deficits in motor timing could not be explained by deficits already present in basic motor output without a timing component. This suggests abnormalities in motor timing were predominantly related to deficient motor timing processes and not to general deficient motor functioning. The finding that deficits in motor timing run in ADHD-families suggests this to be a fruitful domain for further exploration in relation to the genetic underpinnings of ADHD.

). None of these studies, however, used a measure of basic motor speed/variability (without requirements regarding timing/rhythm) in addition to the motor timing measure. Therefore, it remains unclear whether the variability in motor timing is primarily due to variability of motor processes, or due to variability of timing processes or both. Here, we administered two simple motor tasks in addition to the motor timing task, in order to investigate whether deficits were specifically related to the timing of motor output or whether deficits were also observed in tasks that do not require timing of motor output.

), giving support to the hypothesis that motor timing measures may be suitable endophenotypic candidates. It was expected that (1) children with ADHD would be impaired on motor timing measures and not (or to a lesser extent) on motor measures without a timing component, indicating an association between ADHD and motor timing deficits. Furthermore, we expected (2) to find similar findings in the non-affected siblings of the children with ADHD, suggesting motor timing deficits are not merely associated with the disorder. Last, we expected (3) to find correlations between siblings indicating familial resemblance on motor timing measures.

All children were between the ages of 5 and 19 years and were of European Caucasian descent. Participants were excluded, if they had an IQ < 70, a diagnosis of autism, epilepsy, brain disorders or known genetic disorders, such as Down syndrome or Fragile-X-syndrome.

). A standardised algorithm was applied to the PACS and parent rated Conners’ to derive each of the 18 DSM-IV ADHD items, providing operational definitions for each behavioural symptom. These were combined with items that were scored 2 (‘pretty much true’) or 3 (‘very much true’) in the teacher rated Conners’ ADHD subscale to generate the total number of hyperactive-impulsive and inattentive symptoms of the DSM-IV. Situational pervasiveness was defined as at least one symptom occurring within two or more different situations as indicated by the parents in the PACS interview as well as the presence of at least one symptom scoring 2 or 3 on the ADHD subscale as indicated by teachers on the Conners’. Siblings were regarded as non-affected, if they obtained scores in the non-clinical range on both the parent and teacher questionnaires (Conners’-N-scale: T-score ≤ 62, SDQ < 90th percentile). No PACS interview was administered concerning non-affected siblings.

Measures
Motor Timing Task
2005
). Subjects were instructed to press a button with their preferred index finger when they thought a 1-second time interval had elapsed. The start of the interval was announced by a tone. After the subject’s response, visual feedback concerning the accuracy of the response was presented on the screen, indicating whether the response was correct, too short or too long. A response was regarded as correct, if it fell between the lower and upper boundary set by a dynamic tracking algorithm. Boundaries were set at 500 to 1,500 ms at the beginning of the task. If the response fell within these boundaries, the boundaries of the subsequent trial were narrowed by 100 ms. Likewise, the boundaries of the subsequent trial were widened with 100 ms, if the response on the previous trial fell outside the boundaries.
2005
). Dependent measures were accuracy (median of productions in ms, which reflects under- versus over-production) and variability (SD of productions in ms).

Baseline Speed task
1999
). Subjects were required to press a key as quickly as possible, when a fixation cross in the centre of a computer screen changed into a white square. Immediately following the response, the white square changed back into the fixation cross. The time interval between a response and the emergence of the next white square varied randomly between 500 and 2,500 ms in order to prevent anticipation strategies.
A practice session (10 trials) and an experimental session (32 trials) were administered for both hands separately. The task was first practised and executed with the index finger of the non-preferred hand, thereafter practised and executed with the index finger of the preferred hand. Dependent measures were the speed (mean reaction time in ms) and variability (SD of reaction times in ms) of responses.

Tapping task
1999
). Subjects were required to tap as frequently as possible within an interval of 18 s. The beginning and end of the interval were announced by a tone. During tapping, the number of taps was continuously counted and displayed on the screen.
A practice session (5 s) and an experimental session (18 s) were administered for both hands separately. The task was first practised and executed with the index finger of the non-preferred hand, thereafter practised and executed with the index finger of the preferred hand. Dependent measures were speed (mean intertap interval in ms) and variability (SD of intertap intervals in ms) of motor output.

). Participants that took other medication than stimulants to suppress their symptoms of ADHD were also off medication during testing. The medication of these children was gradually decreased in line with standard procedures to allow for sufficient wash-out. Children were motivated with small breaks. At the end of the session, a gift worth approximately € 4, was given. Control children were tested in a similar way in a quiet room at their school. The study had medical-ethical approval.

Since there were group differences for speed and variability of externally cued motor output (Baseline Speed task), the issue was raised whether the deficits found on the Motor Timing task were primarily related to these group differences in basic motor output. Therefore, analyses were undertaken whereby the speed on the Baseline Speed task was used as an additional covariate in the analyses on accuracy on the Motor Timing task. The variability on the Baseline Speed task was used as additional covariate for the analyses on variability on the Motor Timing task.

The adjusted menas after covarying for the variability on the Baseline Speed task were: 438, 428, 424, and 316 ms, respectively. Group contrasts for accuracy and variability as reported above also remained unchanged. These findings suggest that the deficits found on the Motor Timing task can not be explained by the deficits found in basic motor output.



Discussion
There was investigated whether accuracy and variability of motor timing were viable endophenotypic candidates as reflected by poor performance on these measures in children with ADHD (i.e. indicating an association between the deficits and the disorder), reflected by poor performance in non-affected siblings in between their affected siblings and controls (i.e. suggesting a relation between the deficits and a familial susceptibility for the disorder), and reflected by sibling correlations (i.e. signalling familial resemblance for deficits). We administered two motor tasks in addition to a motor timing task, in order to investigate whether deficits were specifically related to the timing of motor output or whether deficits were also observed in tasks requiring motor output without any timing demands.

). These findings suggest a relation between under reproduction (possibly reflecting a somewhat speeded internal clock and/or impulsivity) and ADHD. The findings were less convincing with respect to non-affected siblings: despite a linear trend in group contrasts, their accuracy of motor timing was more like controls than that of affected siblings. Furthermore, correlations between siblings on accuracy were also modest suggesting familial resemblance for accuracy was present but not strongly. Therefore, accuracy of motor timing seems not to be a strong endophenotypic candidate.

Our study adds important knowledge to this topic, showing that non-affected siblings portray a similar type of variability in their motor timing and that siblings resemble each other in the variability of motor timing. These findings suggest the variability in motor timing is not only associated with the disorder, but is related to familial vulnerability for ADHD, which may make it a useful tool in future studies aimed at unraveling the genetic underpinnings of ADHD.

) and suggests slow and variable responding are characteristic of ADHD. However, in contrast to variability of motor timing, non-affected siblings did not differ from controls with respect to speed and variability of externally cued motor output. So, despite the finding that slow and variable motor output is associated with ADHD, it does not appear to be convincingly associated with a familial vulnerability for the disorder.

Conclusions
Variability in motor timing appears a useful endophenotypic candidate: It is clearly associated with ADHD, it is also present in non-affected siblings, and it correlates within families. Accuracy (under- versus over production) in motor timing appears less useful: even though accuracy is associated with ADHD (probands and affected siblings have a tendency to under-produce compared to controls), non-affected siblings did not exhibit this tendency and sibling correlations were only marginally significant. There were group differences in motor speed and variability (Baseline Speed task): probands and affected siblings were slower and more variable in their motor output as response to an external cue. Even though siblings resembled each other in their speed and variability, non-affected siblings performed more like controls. These findings suggest that speed and variability of externally cued motor output are associated with having ADHD, but probably not related to a familial vulnerability for the disorder. Interestingly, the speed and variability in self-generated motor output (Tapping) is normal in probands and affected siblings, making it unsuitable to unravel underlying vulnerabilities leading up to ADHD. Deficits in motor timing cannot be explained by deficits already present in basic motor output without a timing component (Baseline Speed), suggesting abnormalities in motor timing are predominantly related to deficient timing operations but not to deficient motor functioning. The finding that deficits in motor timing run in ADHD-families suggests this to be a fruitful domain for further exploration in relation to the genetic underpinnings of ADHD.
