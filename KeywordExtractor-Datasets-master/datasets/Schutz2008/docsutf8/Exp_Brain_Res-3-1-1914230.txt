Here we report a study of joint-action coordination in transferring objects. Fourteen dyads were asked to repeatedly reposition a cylinder in a shared workspace without using dialogue. Variations in task constraints concerned the size of the two target regions in which the cylinder had to be (re)positioned and the size and weight of the transferred cylinder. Movements of the wrist, index finger and thumb of both actors were recorded by means of a 3D motion-tracking system. Data analyses focused on the interpersonal transfer of lifting-height and movement-speed variations. Whereas the analyses of variance did not reveal any interpersonal transfer effects targeted data comparisons demonstrated that the actor who fetched the cylinder from where the other actor had put it was systematically less surprised by cylinder-weight changes than the actor who was first confronted with such changes. In addition, a moderate, accuracy-constraint independent adaptation to each other’s movement speed was found. The current findings suggest that motor resonance plays only a moderate role in collaborative motor control and confirm the independency between sensorimotor and cognitive processing of action-related information.

), can we also demonstrate co-actors adopting each other’s movement patterns in the simple task of transferring objects? If an object relevant for my own actions is placed in front of me at a high speed, shall I then automatically pick it up and transfer it also with a high speed or will I stick to my own, preferred speed? Furthermore, will an observer be sensitive to the height of the movement trajectory with which an object is placed within reach as a potential cue of that object’s weight?

). We thus examined the extent to which the weight of an object carried from one position to another would be inferred by an observer. If the observer, i.e., the fetching-actor, would not infer the weight of the transferred cylinder, then the surprise-effect expressed in the lifting height of the fetching-actor should be equally large as that in the putting-actor. Conversely, should the fetching-actor correctly infer the weight of the object by observing the putting-actor lifting and repositioning the cylinder, then the fetching-actor should be able to anticipate the cylinder’s weight better and not show such large surprise effects as the putting-actor would.

). The smaller the target area to reach for, the lower the movement speed due to the higher accuracy demands that are associated with small target areas. In the present study we manipulated the target area sizes of the first and the second actor separately, where the size was either small (diameter of 9 cm) or large (diameter of 18 cm). If both actors had identical (either small or large) target area sizes, their movement speeds were most likely to become similar under the assumption that there would be a strong tendency to adopt each others’ speed. If this tendency of movement speed transfer was strong enough, then violations of Fitts’ law in the fetching-actor could be expected under conditions in which the two actors were confronted with dissimilar target area sizes.
In sum, in the present study consisting of a sequential motor task involving two actors we tested whether lifting height—a parameter that potentially could reveal an object’s weight—would be picked up by an observing co-actor and determine her subsequent handling of that object and whether she would be inclined to adapt her speed to the observed speed, or, alternatively, whether the interpersonal transfer of kinematic parameters would be incidental in nature, i.e., unrelated to the task constraints with which the individuals of the dyad were confronted.

Method
Participants
Fourteen right-handed adult dyads participated in the experiment. Their ages ranged from 18 to 30 years; mean age was 22 ± 2 years. The 28 participants, 22 females and 6 males, formed 8 female dyads and 6 dyads of mixed gender. They received either course credits or payment (6 euros per hour) for their participation. Each participant signed an informed consent form. The study was approved by the local ethics committee and performed in accordance with the ethical standards laid down in the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki.

 directions. Each participant wore a pair of earphones through which a repetitive sound was presented at approximately 60 dB throughout the experiment. This prevented the participants from speaking to each other and hearing any task-related noise, e.g., due to the cylinders making contact with the tabletop at completion of the transport phases. Each participant also wore a facial mask to avoid communication by means of facial cues. The participants were seated comfortably at opposite sides of a table on top of which a 1-cm thick marble plate was placed to prevent any object-weight information being conveyed from one actor to the other by means of vibrations via the table surface.
Four cylinders of 25 cm height were used, two with a diameter of 2.5 cm and two with a diameter of 6.5 cm. Two cylinders had a lightweight of 230 g and two cylinders had a weight of 835 g. To avoid any potential confounding between the effects of cylinder and target-area size all cylinders were given a 4-mm thick, circular base of 8 cm in diameter. This ensured that the thin and thick cylinders had the same size support base and could be repositioned in a comparable stable way which was a factor that also could contribute to the accuracy constraints since the participants were asked to place the cylinders on small and large circular target areas that were clearly marked on the table surface.

). The role was randomly assigned to the trial blocks of three repetitions.
In their control trials the participants of dyads 1–9 (arbitrary numbered) performed the fetch-part of the experimental task, i.e., at the start of their control trials they were confronted with a cylinder that was placed in the middle of the table and their task was to pick it up and place it in the area which was closest to their own starting position. Dyads 10–14 performed in their control trials the put-part of the experimental task, i.e., at the start of each trial they found the cylinder on the area closest to themselves and they were instructed to put the cylinder in the target area at the centre of the table. The data analyses showed that there were no systematic differences between the two groups of dyads as far as the targeted research questions concerned so the comparisons with the control trial data will not be addressed further in the remainder of this paper.
The experiment was conducted by two experimenters who sat behind the participants. Each experimenter had a clear view on a separate computer screen which displayed information that specified the experimental conditions of every trial. In-between trials the participants were asked to close their eyes. After both participants had closed their eyes, the experimenters put the appropriate target pads on the table as well as the appropriate cylinder in the starting area of the putting-actor. Then, the two experimenters simultaneously tapped the participants on their lower arm, which indicated that they could open their eyes to start performing the trial. At the same time one of the experimenters started the movement recording.

). Only after the putting-actor had released the cylinder was the fetching-actor allowed to pick up the cylinder and to reposition it in a target area adjacent to her. The action sequence was to be completed within 8 s during which the displacements of the wrist and finger IREDs on both actors were sampled at a rate of 100 Hz. After every 48 trials, or whenever they asked, the participants were offered a 10-min break.

The intervals were detected by a semi-automatic search procedure for relevant local minima in the tangential velocity profiles of the wrist movements. The time indexes thus found could be adjusted with an interactive computer program using a cross-hair whenever the experimenter considered the segmentation inaccurate.

This parameter reflected the surprise effects due to unexpected between-trial cylinder-weight changes on the lifting height, which was defined as the difference in the vertical position of the midpoint between the tips of the digits at the time of grasping the cylinder and the maximum height realized during transportation. In the second interval of each of the three-segment movement patterns, i.e., the green function for the putting-actor and the red function for the fetching-actor, this lifting height reflected the height with which the participants lifted the cylinder while transporting it to their target area.

Lifting-height variations due to the spatial accuracy-constraint manipulations were marginal (<2 mm) and also did not systematically influence the lifting-height variations due to the size-illusion effect.

). However, it remains to be seen whether the mirror-neuron system represents observed actions with a precision that allows for direct imitation. This does not appear to be the case in macaque monkeys. One could claim that any hypothetical system in general could infer the goals/intentions of observed movements without explicitly representing, say, the speed of the movement.
More detailed analyses of incidental interpersonal transfer effects indicated that the situation was more complex than that. When focusing on the effects of between-trial cylinder-weight changes, the actor who was confronted with such changes first showed a systematically larger surprise-effect than the actor who was asked to transport the cylinder after the first actor had done so. A key finding here was that through the realized trajectory height during object transportation, the object mass was picked up by movement observation and integrated into the observer’s movement plan. Our prediction was therefore confirmed, i.e., the movements of an actor are likely to affect a subsequent, complementary movement generated by an observer.

Our interpretation of the current results does rely, of course, on the validity of both the weight-change effects and the co-variation of the actors’ movement speeds. It could be argued that the fetcher’s movement speed covaried with that of the putter due to a non-specific, visually primed increase in attention rather than the direct consequence of perceiving the putter’s object-transportation movements. However, attentional mechanisms are an unlikely explanation for our observations since the only visual cue that could have increased the attention in the fetcher was the putter’s movement speed. Whether the object-weight related adaptation in the fetcher to the observed movement of the putter was due to the inference of the weight of the object or to the observed kinematics per se, also remains a matter of discussion. If it was the former, then motor resonance (i.e., mirror-neuron system) may not be responsible for a direct transfer of the kinematics parameters.
The effects of the object and the accuracy constraints differ in one fundamental aspect. The expected information transfer for the object is valid for the programming of the movement, while any hypothesized transfer of speed, by simple copying the observed movement to reduce dimensionality violates Fitts’ law. This implies that our hypothesis about the transfer of speed was either not valid or that the effect is intrinsically short lived because the duration of the effect is overruled by intrapersonal constraints. In other words, while the information about weight change is very relevant for movement programming, the examined speed changes were not.

). Fourth, observed movements might provide clues about the task constraints at hand. In the present experiment, lifting height was such a parameter that indicated to the observer the weight of the cylinder that was transported. Fifth, observed movements may provide a global scaling parameter of ones own future actions, specifically if these actions are complementary to those performed by the actor that is being observed. Further research into the factors that determine the relative importance of these various roles which action observation may play in joint action is clearly needed.

) who showed that action observation activates cortical motor areas as if the observer had performed the task herself, i.e., when an observer who is facing an actor sees that actor move with her right hand the right cortical motor areas of the observer become activated indicating that the observer would have executed the task with her left hand. These findings suggest that movement simulation is egocentric and viewpoint-dependent.
