Members of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family are key signaling proteins in the induction and regulation of angiogenesis, both during development and in pathological conditions. However, signaling mediated through VEGF family proteins and their receptors has recently been shown to have direct effects on neurons and glial cells. In the present study, we immunocytochemically investigated the expression and cellular distribution of VEGFA, VEGFB, and their associated receptors (VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2) in focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) type IIB from patients with medically intractable epilepsy. Histologically normal temporal cortex and perilesional regions displayed neuronal immunoreactivity (IR) for VEGFA, VEGFB, and VEGF receptors (VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2), mainly in pyramidal neurons. Weak IR was observed in blood vessels and there was no notable glial IR within the grey and white matter. In all FCD specimens, VEGFA, VEGFB, and both VEGF receptors were highly expressed in dysplastic neurons. IR in astroglial and balloon cells was observed for VEGFA and its receptors. VEGFR-1 displayed strong endothelial staining in FCD. Double-labeling also showed expression of VEGFA, VEGFB and VEGFR-1 in cells of the microglia/macrophage lineage. The neuronal expression of both VEGFA and VEGFB, together with their specific receptors in FCD, suggests autocrine/paracrine effects on dysplastic neurons. These autocrine/paracrine effects could play a role in the development of FCD, preventing the death of abnormal neuronal cells. In addition, the expression of VEGFA and its receptors in glial cells within the dysplastic cortex indicates that VEGF-mediated signaling could contribute to astroglial activation and associated inflammatory reactions.

Materials and methods
Subjects
The cases included in this study were obtained from the databases of the Departments of Neuropathology of the Academic Medical Center (University of Amsterdam; UVA) in Amsterdam and the University Medical Center in Utrecht (UMCU). We examined surgically resected tissue from nine patients undergoing epilepsy surgery for focal cortical dysplasia. Informed consent was obtained for the use of brain tissue and for access to medical records for research purposes. The tissue was obtained and used in a manner compliant with the Declaration of Helsinki.

Normal-appearing control cortex/white matter from temporal region was obtained at autopsy from five adult control patients (male/female: 2/3; mean age 42, range 17–55) without history of neurological diseases. All autopsies were performed within 12 h after death (post mortem delay: 11, 11.5, 9, 8.5, 6). The cause of death was represented by acute myocardial infarction. In addition, four of the nine FCD cases contained sufficient amount of perilesional zone (normal-appearing cortex/white matter adjacent to the lesion), for comparison with the autopsy specimens. This material represents good disease control tissue, since it is exposed to the same seizure activity, drugs, fixation time, and the age and gender are also the same.

Tissue preparation
Tissue was fixed in 10% buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin. Two representative paraffin blocks per case (containing the complete lesion or the largest part of the lesion resected at surgery) were sectioned, stained, and assessed. Paraffin-embedded tissue was sectioned at 6 μm, mounted on organosilane-coated slides (Sigma, St Louis, MO) and used for histological and immunocytochemical reactions as described below. Frozen tissue from control cortex and FCD tissue, stored at −80°C, was used for western blot analysis.

Antibody characterization
To document the presence of a heterogeneous population of cells, we used the following antibodies: glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP; polyclonal rabbit, DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark; 1:4,000; monoclonal mouse, DAKO; 1:50), vimentin (mouse clone V9, DAKO; 1:1,000), MAP2 (polyclonal rabbit; Chemicon; 1:500), neuronal nuclear protein (NeuN; mouse clone MAB377, Chemicon, Temecula, CA, USA; 1:2,000), non-phosphorylated neurofilament (SMI311; Sternberger monoclonals, Lutherville, MD; 1:1,000), human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DP, -DQ, -DR (CR3/43; monoclonal mouse, DAKO; 1:400), CD68 (mouse clone PG-M1, DAKO; 1:200) and CD31 (mouse clone JC70A, DAKO; 1:100).

]. For electrophoresis, equal amounts of proteins (30 μg/lane) were separated by sodium dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic (SDS-PAGE) analysis in 7.5–12.5% gels. Separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose paper for 1 h and 30 min, using a semi-dry electroblotting system (BioRad, Transblot SD, Hercules, CA, USA). Blots were incubated overnight in TTBS (20 mM Tris , 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween, pH 7.5)/5% non-fat dry milk, containing the primary antibody (VEGFA, VEGFR-1, and VEGFR-2, 1:1,000; VEGFB, 1:200). After several washes in TTBS, the membranes were incubated in TTBS/5% non-fat dry milk/1% BSA, containing the goat anti-rabbit coupled to horseradish peroxidase (1:2,500; Dako, Denmark) for 1 h. After washes in TTBS, immunoreactivity was visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham, Buckinghamshire, UK). Expression of β-actin (monoclonal mouse, Sigma, St Louis, MO; 1:50,000) was used as reference protein. Because of the limited availability of frozen material from FCD cases, a complete analysis with statistical comparison between control and FCD by immunoblot could not be performed.

diluted in methanol to quench the endogenous peroxidase activity. Antigen retrieval was performed by incubation for 10 min at 121°C in citrate buffer (0.01 M, pH 6.0); sections were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and incubated for 30 min in 10% normal goat serum (Harlan Sera-Lab, Loughborough, Leicestershire, UK). We incubated the sections with the primary antibodies overnight at 4°C. Hereafter, sections were washed in PBS and we used the ready-for-use Powervision peroxidase system (Immunologic, Duiven, The Netherlands) and 3,3′-diaminobenzidine as chromogen to develop the staining. Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin, dehydrated, and coverslipped. Sections incubated without the primary antibody and excess of the antigenic peptide were essentially blank.

This is an observational study and we were, therefore, not able to investigate the spatio-temporal regulation of the VEGF system. Further research in animal models of cortical dysplasia is clearly needed to elucidate the role of VEGFs and their signaling pathways in the histogenesis or epileptogenesis of developmental disorders.

], seizures alone cannot account for changes in neuronal and glial expression in FCD since perilesional tissue was exposed to seizures but did not show significant upregulation of VEGFs and/or VEGFRs. Therefore, the lesion per se or the concomitant presence of the lesion and the epileptic activity, are likely to play a role in modulating the VEGF system in these developmental disorders.


Conclusions
Our observed cellular distribution of VEGFA, VEGFB, and their signaling receptors indicate that different cellular components of FCD are involved in VEGF-signaling. In this context, future studies, using both in vivo and in vitro models, will be important to achieve a better understanding of the role of the VEGF-mediated pathways in the histogenesis and epileptogenesis of developmental lesions associated with intractable chronic epilepsy. Presently, signaling via VEGF receptors is not targeted by existing therapies in epileptic patients, but it can be potentially useful in view of its involvement in the regulation of neurogenesis, inflammation, and BBB integrity. However, an effective therapeutic intervention based on modulation of the VEGF system has to take into consideration the specific role of VEGFA and VEGFB and the multiple effects (protective and/or detrimental) reported for VEGFA.
