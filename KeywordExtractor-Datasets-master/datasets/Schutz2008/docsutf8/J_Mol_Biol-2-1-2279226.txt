Abstract
in trans
. In contrast, histone H4 tetra-acetylation was also found to reduce the activity of the Chd1 and Isw2 remodelling enzymes by reducing catalytic turnover without affecting recruitment. These observations illustrate a range of different means by which modifications to histones can influence the action of remodelling enzymes.

As a histone bearing the relevant cysteine point mutation is most closely matched to the product of a peptide ligation reaction, we have generally presented data using the point mutant as a control rather than the wild-type histone sequence. However, we are not aware of any cases where the choice of control affects the conclusions drawn.

 This loss of nucleosomes at the promoter is correlated with spikes in histone acetylation levels, leading to the hypothesis that ATP-dependent remodellers may recognise this signal and promote transfer. To test whether there is a direct link between histone modification and octamer transfer, the efficiency of octamer transfer from different chromatin substrates by the RSC complex was measured.

 Here we look at examples from three distinct subfamilies of chromatin remodellers: Chd1, Isw2 and RSC. The ATPase activity of these enzyme classes is stimulated by DNA and nucleosomes. Whereas it had been noted that histone tails and modifications affected their remodelling activity, it was not clear in many cases whether this was due to altered binding of modified nucleosomes or due to altered rates of ATP hydrolysis after binding. Using a real-time ATPase assay we show that depending on the particular enzyme involved either may be the case.

). It is notable that in the case of both Chd1 and Isw2, the effects of tail acetylation or truncation on ATPase activity are smaller than the effects on nucleosome sliding. It is possible that there is some amplification of the effect on ATPase activity due to multiple rounds of remodelling being required for repositioning. Alternatively, alterations to the H4 tail may reduce the efficiency with which these enzymes reposition nucleosomes in addition to altering their ability to hydrolyse ATP.

Native peptide ligation
21,22

 The 1–2 mM globular histone was dissolved in 6 M GnCl, 0.2 M phosphate (pH 7.3) together with 0.4–0.5 mM thioester peptide and 2% (v/v) thiophenol, typically to a final volume of 200–300 μl. This was vortexed, and the reaction left at room temperature for 16–24 h. The reaction was stopped by adding DTT to 100 mM and dialysing the reactants against three changes of 500 ml SAUD0 buffer (7 M urea, 20 mM sodium acetate (pH 5.2), 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM EDTA pH 8.0, 0 mM NaCl) using a 12–14 kDa MWCO dialysis membrane. The dialysed ligation mixture in SAUD0 buffer was spun to remove protein precipitate, and the supernatant loaded onto a 1 ml SOURCE 15S (Pharmacia) ion exchange column running at 1.5 ml/min to separate unligated globular histone from the full length product. A stepwise elution using SAUD0 (buffer A) and SAUD2000 (buffer B) (7 M urea, 20 mM sodium acetate (pH 5.2), 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM EDTA (pH 8.0), 2 M NaCl) was used to elute in as small a volume as possible. The H3 Δ1-27 S28C and H4 Δ1-20 V21C constructs elute at a conductivity of 14 milliSiemens (mS), equivalent to approximately 180 mM NaCl, whereas full length histones elute at less than 25mS, 500 mM NaCl. This is typically 9.2%, and 25% SAUD2000, but due to variations in buffer preparation, the concentration of the two buffers required to obtain this conductivity should be determined empirically. We found that histones can elute in multiple peaks even though they are identical by SDS–PAGE and mass spectrometry, presumably representing differentially folded sub-species. The globular histone was eluted over 15 ml and the full-length histone over 10 ml, before the column was washed in SAUD2000 for 6 min in-between runs to remove tightly bound proteins and then re-equilibrated in buffer A. The relevant fractions are collected, diluted with SAUD0 to a final salt concentration below 100 mM NaCl and reloaded onto the column. We found that two to three rounds of purification were required to obtain greater than 95% pure ligated protein as determined by SDS–PAGE (Gradipore, Australia). The final fractions are concentrated using a YM-10 centricon (Millipore) to approximately 200 μl and their concentration measured by absorbance at 276 nm.

 an irreversible intramolecular rearrangement to produce a covalent native peptide bond without the introduction of unnatural chemical moieties. (b) Full-length acetylated histones were purified away from the reactants by two rounds of ion exchange chromatography using a step gradient. Lane 1 shows a representative reaction in which ligation had proceeded to around 40%. The top two panels show the traces from the first and second chromatography runs used to purify the ligated product from the unreacted material. The bottom panel shows SDS–PAGE of fractions taken form the positions (i, ii, and iii) indicated on the traces. Fraction iii, consists of over 95% ligated full length histone H3. (c) Acetylated histone octamers formed nucleosomes similar to those formed by unmodified histone octamers. Interestingly, the mobility of tetra-acetylated H3 nucleosomes during native PAGE was slightly reduced compared to control nucleosomes of the wild-type sequence; compare lanes 1 and 2 or histones containing cysteine point mutations (not shown).



Figure 2
Effects of histone acetylation on intrinsic nucleosome mobility. (a) Outline of competitive remodelling assay used to accurately measure differences between nucleosomes. This setup has the advantage that the reaction times and conditions are exactly the same for two nucleosomes and avoids the possibility of observing effects due to different nucleosome reconstitution efficiencies. (b) Histone H4 tetra-acetylation does not alter the rate at which nucleosomes reposition thermally. Two pmol of H4 acetylated and H4 V21C unmodified nucleosomes assembled on 54A54 DNA were mixed and incubated at 47 °C for the specified amount of time. The images represent the Cy3 (H4 V21C) and Cy5 (H4 acetylated) scans of the same gel. The amount of remodelling is plotted to the right of the gels and a hyperbolic curve fitted to the data points. From this the initial rate of repositioning is calculated and the average of three independent repeats displayed in (e). (c) Tetra-acetylation of H3 results in a twofold increase in the rate of intrinsic nucleosome mobility. Reaction conditions are as for (b). (d) The increase in nucleosome mobility by H3 acetylation is not solely due to charge neutralisation. Two pmol of H3 wild-type and H3 in which the lysine residues at position 9, 14, 18 and 23 had been substituted to alanine were assembled on 54A18 DNA were mixed and incubated at 47 °C for the specified amounts of time. Substituting the lysine residues with alanine, which will reduce the basic charge of the tail, had no effect on nucleosome mobility. (e) Table indicating the initial rate of repositioning relative to control for the three constructs described above.

 Inclusion of nucleosomes deposited at this location had little effect on the calculated initial rate of sliding so they were excluded from quantitative analysis. (b) H4 tetra-acetylated nucleosomes, in contrast, are not repositioned faster by the RSC complex. (c) Nucleosomes that are both H3 and H4 tetra-acetylated are not repositioned any faster than H3 tetra-acetylated nucleosomes, confirming that H4 tetra-acetylation does not promote RSC catalysed repositioning. (d) Table indicating the average initial rate of repositioning relative to control and standard deviation from three independent experiments for the acetylated constructs described above.

 is significantly reduced, suggesting that the H4 tail is an allosteric effector for Chd1.



Figure 7
H4 tetra-acetylation increases octamer transfer by RSC. (a) Octamer transfer assay: RSC is able to disrupt nucleosomes and transfer the histone octamer from unlabelled donor nucleosomes onto a separate DNA molecule, in this case a radiolabelled 147 bp 0W0 fragment derived from the 601 positioning sequence. This is measured by the shift in mobility of a radiolabelled DNA fragment to that of a nucleosome. (b) Efficiency of octamer transfer from different donor nucleosomes. H3 tetra-acetylated nucleosomes are transferred faster than unmodified nucleosomes consisting of wild-type H3 and H4: compare lanes 4–6 with lanes 1–3. Surprisingly, H4 tetra-acetylated nucleosomes are also transferred faster than control: compare lanes 7–9 with lanes 1–3. When both H3 and H4 are acetylated the effect is additive (compare lanes 10–12 with 1–3). Lane 13 shows an equivalent amount of free DNA in the absence of RSC or nucleosomes and lane 14 is a nucleosome reconstituted separately on the same DNA fragment as a mobility reference. (c) Table plotting the amount of octamer transfer from different donor nucleosomes as the average of three independent repeats. Error bars represent the standard deviation. Although histones of wild-type sequence are used as a control in the data shown, octamers bearing cysteine mutations behaved similarly.
