Background
The current method for radiological measurements on plain X-rays of distal radius fractures is unreliable. We examined the reproducibility of a new X-ray assessment technique—where the uninjured side is used as a template for the injured side—compared to the conventional assessment technique.

Methods
X-rays of 30 patients with a unilateral distal radial fracture were included reflecting the prevalence of AO fracture types in clinical practice. Eight experienced observers assessed these X-rays on two separated occasions (2-month interval) using the traditional measurement technique and the template technique. Reproducibility of the X-ray assessments was quantified by intraclass correlations and weighted kappa coefficients.

Results
The reproducibility of the radial length measurement did not improve nor did the volar angulation measurement. However, marked improvement in reproducibility was observed for the radial inclination measurement, the kappa increased from 0.36 (95 % CI; 0.30–0.41) to 0.49 (95 % CI; 0.43–0.55) in the template technique. As a result, the classification of the reduction results (Lidström score) greatly improved. The overall kappa for the Lidström score improved from 0.37 (95 % CI; 0.31/0.43) to 0.59 (0.52/0.63).

Conclusion
The assessment technique using the uninjured side as a template for the injured side resulted only in an improved reproducibility of the radial inclination measurement which in turn resulted in an improved classification reproducibility of the reduction results.

Materials and methods
Inclusion criteria
Patients aged 18 years or above with a unilateral dislocated distal radial fracture with the history of neither a distal radial fracture nor a distal radial operation were included after informed consent was taken. A stratification for the AO fracture types was performed to reflect the prevalence in clinical practice at a ratio of 5:2:3 for the AO type A, B and C distal radial fractures. The standard post-reduction (postero-anterior (PA) and lateral) X-rays and standard distal radius X-rays of the unaffected side of 30 consecutive patients visiting the emergency department were included after stratification for AO fracture type.

]: <0.00 poor; 0.00–0.20 slight; 0.21–0.40 fair; 0.41–0.60 moderate; 0.61–0.80 substantial and 0.81–1.00 almost perfect agreement. Calculation of the reproducibility coefficients were carried out considering the pair-wise ratings of all possible combinations of observers. For example, observer 1 and 2, observer 1 and 3, observer 1 and 4, and so on to observer 1 and 8. Then observer 2 and 3, observer 2 and 4, observer 2 and 5 and so on to observer 2 and 8. This was done for each observer to the last observers 7 and 8. For 8 observers and 30 X-rays this resulted in 28 (8 × 7/2) possible pairs times 30 X-rays, totalling 840 pairs of observations. Sample size and number of observers were chosen to accommodate the precision of the reproducibility estimates we wanted to achieve. When the number of observations is 840, a 2-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) for a reproducibility coefficient arbitrarily set at 0.40 will extend 0.05 around the point estimate (from 0.35 to 0.45). Statistical evaluations were carried out using SPSS 11.5 and StatXact 3.02 for Windows.


Results
Thirty patients with distal radial fractures were included. Of these patients, 15 fractures were of AO classification group A, 6 AO classification group B and 9 of AO classification group C.

Discussion
Compared to the traditional quantitative technique, the template assessment technique resulted only in an improved inter-observer reproducibility for the radial inclination. There were slight improvements in reproducibility of the radial length and volar angulation. However, there was a notable improvement in the reproducibility of reduction results as assessed using the Lidström score.

]. As in our study, a better reproducibility was found for the volar angulation on the lateral view.
In this comparative study we had the same observers and the same patients with a 2-month interval and X-rays presented in another sequence order to overcome possible bias. The patients’ sample was chosen to reflect the daily practice in which the AO type A fractures are more frequent than the Type B and C.

]. Therefore, the use of normal values may lead to inaccurate classification of the reduction result. However, in our study, the comparison with the normal values did not negatively influenc the reproducibility, since all observers used the same values. By doing so, the only source of error left was the direct measurement of the fractured side. When the normal side is used to compare with in the classical measurement way, there would be measurement errors of the fractured side and of the uninjured side.

), there is still an axis needed. This becomes more eminent as the radial styloid is displaced more laterally (or rotated) and both tips of the radial styloid are not in line with the radial axis any more. Differences in placing the axis could be a source for variance, leading to a limited improvement in the Kappa value. In contrast, the radial inclination on the PA view in the template technique is basically independent of the radial axis and therefore more easy to measure with the template.
A limitation of the template technique is that it may not be applicable in patients with a bilateral fracture or patients with a history of a distal radial fracture or deformity on the other side. In this study, only patients with a unilateral distal radial fracture were included, reflecting the most common occurrence of distal radial fractures.
Another limitation of this study was that, in order to avoid learning curves, only experienced observers were used, which may not always be the case in daily practice. Also, the templates of the unaffected side were made by the same investigator. In daily practice, making the template could also be a source of variation since the correct position of the templates may be more difficult in case of severe dislocation or with slight differences in projection of the bones due to the angle of the X-ray beam. Perhaps the use of digital subtraction may be helpful to overcome this.

]. This procedure can also be performed for other radiological parameters such as ulnar variance. Future research should focus on the improvement of the template technique and the use of digital measurement—subtraction techniques/software modules in this time of filmless X-Ray pictures.
