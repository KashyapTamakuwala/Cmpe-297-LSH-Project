Finally, we discuss the implication of this information for the optimization of the AMC-BAL into a more efficient bioartificial liver.

Both models were created in the modeling software Gambit 2 (Fluent Inc., Sheffield, UK). All dimensions were derived from a laboratory-scale AMC-BAL or were supplied by the manufacturer. The curvature of the mat was neglected and the inflow and outflow zones before and after the mat segments in the AMC-BAL were not included in the micro models. Each standard micro model contains the equivalent capillary wall surface of 1 whole capillary. Since the entire laboratory-scale AMC-BAL contains 300 capillaries, each micro model can thus be considered as 1/300th part of AMC-BAL. Consequently, one AMC-BAL can be regarded as a combination of 300 separate micro models in parallel.

 was calculated as an average of 10 measurements. Resistance to flow of hepatocyte cell layers (section “Modeling oxygen transport and consumption”) was modeled using the same viscous resistance factor.

Boundary Conditions
We assumed that total flow rate (15 ml/min) inside the research scale AMC-BAL is homogenously distributed. In this way, each micro model has the same flow rate of 0.05 ml/min, i.e. 1/300th of the total flow rate. Pressure inlet boundary conditions were used; outlet boundary condition was a zero pressure outflow; the capillary walls were ‘no-slip’ walls and symmetry boundary conditions were used at the side walls of the model.

Hepatocyte Distribution in the Micro Models

 setting, the laboratory scale AMC-BAL is seeded with 1 billion porcine hepatocytes via three different loading ports, while gently rotating the bioreactor to assure a homogeneous cell distribution. As we assumed that one micro model is one 300th part of an entire laboratory scale AMC-BAL, one micro model contained 3.33 million cells.

The complete AMC-BAL cannot be modeled by using only one cell distribution or only one micro model. Therefore, each cell distribution was applied to both micro models, leading to four basic configurations in total. All four micro model configurations were assessed independently. With a combination of these micro models, the entire AMC-BAL can be modeled in future studies.

Discussion
Fluid Flow and Shear Stress Distribution
Perfusion of a micro model was largely influenced by the presence of the non-woven mat. Although the cross-sectional area of the inter-capillary space and the non-woven mat are roughly the same size, fluid flow in the mat zone was generally two orders of magnitude smaller as compared to the flow in the inter-capillary space. This effect is caused by the higher resistance to flow of the non-woven mat, forcing the majority of fluid flow through the inter-capillary spaces, which have a negligible flow resistance. This also causes the overall pressure loss to be minimal. Since the same hydraulic permeability is used for the hepatocyte layers, fluid velocities there are also in the range of micrometer per second. Consequently, apart from the incorporation of additional gas capillaries (case 10–11), also the presence of hepatocyte layers around the capillaries (cell distribution 2) increased flow velocities and pressure loss in the model as the free cross-sectional area of the inter-capillary space is reduced. Fluid flow simulations for the inline and triangular variant of the different case studies render identical results for velocity profiles, pressure loss and shear stress distributions. This was expected as the micro models consist of the identical geometrical entities, which are only changed in location relative to each other. From a fluid dynamical point of view, we conclude that the change in capillary arrangement along the course of the spiral mat in the AMC-BAL does not influence fluid flow, pressure drop or shear stress distribution.

 This is considered advantageous for cell culture inside the AMC-BAL.
Shear stress was also assessed as it is a possible determinant of cellular damage and reduced metabolic function. Shear stress is directly proportional to the local velocity gradient and the fluid viscosity. Consequently, shear stresses are generally more elevated in cases with higher velocity magnitudes in the inter-capillary space (e.g. in case of increased flow rate, doubled number of capillaries, cell distribution 2) and where fluid viscosity is increased (e.g. when plasma was used instead of culture medium – ‘clinical setting’ – case 12–13). Results show that only hepatocytes located at the side of the mat and at the border of the hepatocyte layers with the inter-capillary space are subjected to a certain level of shear stress.

Oxygen Transport and Consumption
We assessed the oxygen availability in different case studies and in different micro model configurations. In this paragraph, the results are discussed per case.

 penetration into the mat decreases rapidly further downstream, since as the majority of oxygen content in the convective flow is already consumed in the first part of the micro model. Nevertheless, oxygen level in the culture medium is not totally depleted at the end of the micro model as the fluid transit time is not sufficiently long for all oxygen to diffuse to the hepatocytes.

 in this reference case.
Since regions which are oxygenated by one gas capillary in particular do not overlap or influence each other in the reference case simulations, diffusive oxygen supply by the capillaries is independent of relative capillary location. Convective oxygen transport is also identical as flow distribution is irrespective of capillary placement (section “Fluid flow and shear stress distribution”). Consequently, inline and triangular capillary pattern give identical results concerning oxygen transport and consumption in these reference cases when the same hepatocyte distribution is used, as is confirmed by simulation results.
