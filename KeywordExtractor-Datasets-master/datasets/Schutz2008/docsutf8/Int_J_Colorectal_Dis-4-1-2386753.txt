Backgrounds and aim
In recent decades, fibrin glue has appeared as an alternative treatment for high perianal fistulas. Early results seemed promising, with high success rates being reported. However, with increasing follow-up, the enthusiasm was tempered because of disappointing results. The aim of this retrospective study was to assess the additional value of fibrin glue in combination with transanal advancement flap, compared to advancement flap alone, for the treatment of high transsphincteric fistulas of cryptoglandular origin.

Materials and methods
Between January 1995 and January 2006, 127 patients were operated for high perianal fistulas with an advancement flap. After exclusion of patients with inflammatory bowel disease or HIV, 80 patients remained. A consecutive series of 26 patients had an advancement flap combined with obliteration of the fistula tract with fibrin glue. Patients were matched for prior fistula surgery, and the advancement was performed identically in all patients. In the fibrin glue group, glue was installed retrogradely in the fistula tract after the advancement was completed and the fistula tract had been curetted.

Conclusion
Obliterating the fistula tract with fibrin glue was associated with worse outcome after rectal advancement flap for high perianal fistulas.

The aim of this study was to assess the additional value of fibrin glue to the transanal rectal advancement flap in a well-defined group of patients with high transsphincteric fistulas of cryptoglandular origin. Patients with previous fistula surgery are a surgically more challenging group as the result of scar tissue and sometimes anal stenosis. Therefore, patients were matched for the presence of a history of fistula surgery.

Surgical technique
 On the day of surgery, an enema was administered to the patient to clean the proctum. All procedures were performed under general or locoregional anesthesia in the lithotomy position, and broad spectrum antibiotics were administered perioperatively. Subsequently, the internal opening was located by probing the external opening. During surgery, the amount of sphincter involved was judged by palpation of the puborectal sling and the inferior edge of the external sphincter complex. In cases where the internal opening was not found by probing, hydrogen peroxide was injected to locate the internal opening. In case of active sepsis, a seton was placed for a period of at least 3 months insuring adequate drainage. In the group that was operated with the AF, the internal opening was excised followed by mobilization of the mucosa, submucosa, and a small amount of muscular fibers from the internal sphincter complex. The rectal flap was mobilized to sufficiently cover the internal opening with overlap. Hemostasis was performed to prevent a hematoma under the flap. The base of the advancement flap was kept wide enough to ensure adequate circulation in the flap. The internal opening was not closed before advancing the flap over the internal opening. This was followed by suturing the flap in the distal anal canal with Vicryl 2/0 after the fistula tract had been curetted. In the AF + G group, the identical procedure was carried out. In addition to the advancement procedure, fibrin glue was installed retrogradely in the fistula tract after the AF was completed and the fistula tract had been curetted. Installation of the fibrin glue was performed via the external opening, under direct vision of the advancement flap to prevent flap dislocation and subsequent failure. No specific postoperative instructions were given to the patients.
Data collection
 Chart review was performed on age, gender, tertiary referral, previous fistula surgery, smoking habits, complications, and fistula recurrence. All patients visited the outpatient’s clinics on a regular basis (every 2–4 weeks) until full closure of the fistula tract was achieved. The fistula was considered closed if the external opening was closed and no discharge or pain was experienced; otherwise, it was considered as a persistent or recurrent fistula. No routine postoperative imaging or proctoscopy was performed to confirm the closure of the fistula tract. The data was collected retrospectively and the outcome was compared between groups.

]. In the present series, an attempt was made to decrease the recurrence rate of the surgical treatment of high transsphincteric perianal fistulas of cryptoglandular origin by combining the two methods, i.e., fibrin glue and the rectal advancement flap in a consecutive series of patients. Overall, although not significant, a clear trend was found consisting of a worse outcome for patients from the AF + G group. The recurrence rate was 46% compared to 17% in the AF + G and AF group, respectively. In the group without a history of fistula surgery, patients in the AF + G group did significantly worse than the AF group. In the group with a history of fistula surgery, no significantly different recurrence rates were found.

] reported on a series of 58 patients randomized into advancement flap repair alone or advancement flap repair combined with fibrin glue. Selected were patients with perianal fistulas where the fistula tract comprised more than 30 to 50% of the sphincter complex. Furthermore, patients were included when the fistula was located anteriorly in women or when the patient had a history of incontinence. In two thirds of the patients, the mucosal advancement flap was used and the remaining patients were treated by anodermal advancement flap. The recurrence rate was significantly higher in the group where fibrin glue was combined with the advancement flap compared to the group treated only by advancement (46% vs 20%). Two techniques, i.e., mucosal advancement flap and anodermal advancement flap, were used. Furthermore, no information was provided on the distribution of causes of the fistulas in both groups making the results difficult to interpret.

]. A possible explanation to why the AF + G group does worse is that the closure of the fistula tract with the fibrin glue leads to a situation where insufficient drainage from the primary and eventual secondary fistula tracts occurs.

] reported on 39 patients with perianal fistulas treated with fibrin glue. The overall recurrence rate was 69%. In 6 of the 39 patients, the internal opening was closed using a figure eight suture to avoid clot extrusion because of high pressure from the anal canal during defecation. Four of these patients had a recurrence (33%).

], assessed the additional value of fibrin glue to the transanal rectal advancement flap of only patients with high transsphincteric fistulas of cryptoglandular origin with a long follow-up. The rectal advancement flap combined with fibrin glue installation was associated with a significantly higher recurrence rate, compared to the advancement flap treatment alone, in patients without previous fistula surgery. This observation must be interpreted carefully because of the small sample size of the AF + G group. As the costs of the fibrin glue are considerable and the therapeutic effect very doubtful, it cannot be recommended routinely in the adjunct of transanal rectal advancement flap treating high perianal fistulas. The rectal advancement flap remains the treatment of choice for high transsphincteric perianal fistulas of cryptoglandular origin until novel methods like the anal fistula plug are studied sufficiently in randomized trials.
