Chronic kidney disease (CKD) in children is associated with dramatic changes in the growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) axis, resulting in growth retardation. Moderate-to-severe growth retardation in CKD is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Renal failure is a state of GH resistance and not GH deficiency. Some mechanisms of GH resistance are: reduced density of GH receptors in target organs, impaired GH-activated post-receptor Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) signaling, and reduced levels of free IGF-1 due to increased inhibitory IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs). Treatment with recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) has been proven to be safe and efficacious in children with CKD. Even though rhGH has been shown to improve catch-up growth and to allow the child to achieve normal adult height, the final adult height is still significantly below the genetic target. Growth retardation may persist after renal transplantation due to multiple factors, such as steroid use, decreased renal function and an abnormal GH–IGF1 axis. Those below age 6 years are the ones to benefit most from transplantation in demonstrating acceleration in linear growth. Newer treatment modalities targeting the GH resistance with recombinant human IGF-1 (rhIGF-1), recombinant human IGFBP3 (rhIGFBP3) and IGFBP displacers are under investigation and may prove to be more effective in treating growth failure in CKD.

Learning objectives:
To review the normal growth pattern in childhood and its alteration in chronic kidney disease.

To understand the mechanisms believed to be responsible for growth failure in chronic kidney disease.

To understand the new evidence supporting therapy for growth failure in chronic kidney disease.

To identify targets for future therapies for treatment of growth retardation in chronic kidney disease.

Alteration of normal growth patterns in CKD

Ghrelin has been shown to increase the release of GH which is amplified by co-administration of GHRH, and acts at the level of the hypothalamus and pituitary. The role of ghrelin in the growth abnormalities in CKD has yet to be defined.

Conclusion
This review of the literature lends support to the concept that CKD is associated with GH “resistance”. Despite adequate treatment with rhGH and improvement in catch-up growth, children with CKD display a final adult height that is often below the genetic target. The potential for newer therapies with rhIGF-1, combined use of rhGH and rhIGF-1, combined use of rhIGF-1 and rhIGFBP3 or IGFBP displacers to improve both the short and long term outcomes in the treatment of the disturbances in the GH/IGF-1 axis in CKD awaits future investigations.
