We studied the localization of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) in the goldfish outer plexiform layer by light-and electron-microscopical immunohistochemistry. The mGluR1α antibody labeled putative ON-type bipolar cell dendrites and horizontal cell processes in both rod spherules and cone triads. Immunolabeling for mGluR2/3 was absent in the rod synaptic complex but was found at horizontal cell dendrites directly opposing the cone synaptic ribbon. The mGluR5 antibody labeled Müller cell processes wrapping rod terminals and horizontal cell somata. The mGluR7 antibody labeled mainly horizontal cell dendrites invaginating rods and cones and some putative bipolar cell dendrites in the cone synaptic complex. The finding of abundant expression of various mGluRs in bipolar and horizontal cell dendrites suggests multiple sites of glutamatergic modulation in the outer retina.

Materials and methods
Subjects
Carassius auratus
), 12–15 cm standard body length, were obtained from a commercial supplier and maintained at 16°C in aerated tanks filled with tap water circulating through a biological filter system. The fish were fed and kept on a 12 h/12 h light-dark cycle. All animal experiments were approved by the ethical committee of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences, acting in accordance with the European Communities Council Directive of 24 November 1986 (86/609/EEC).

Preparation
Dissections took place early in the morning (between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m.) under ambient light. The fish used in this study were therefore all in the light phase of their circadian regime. After cervical transection, the cornea and lens of light-adapted animals were removed, and the remaining eyecups were cut in half through the equator. Half-eyecups were placed vitreous-side-down on a Millipore filter (13 mm diameter, 8 μm pore size; Millipore, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) placed on a filter holder. Suction was applied to remove the vitreous; the sclera and retinal pigment epithelium were peeled away.

Light microscopy
Retinas were fixed at room temperature for 10 min in 0.1 M phosphate-buffered 4% paraformaldehyde (pH 6.5) and for another 10 min in 0.1 M sodium carbonate-buffered 4% paraformaldehyde (pH 10.4). These short fixation times were chosen to prevent loss of antigenicity. After being rinsed in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (PB, pH 7.4), the tissue was cryoprotected at room temperature for 30 min in PB containing 12.5% sucrose and for 1–2 h in PB containing 25% sucrose.
The pieces of retina, still attached to the filter, were embedded in Tissue Tek (Sakura Finetek Europe, Zouterwoude, The Netherlands) in an aluminum boat and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Sections (8–10 μm thick) were cut in a cryostat, mounted on poly-L-lysine-coated slides (Menzel-Gläser, Braunschweig, Germany), dried and stored in a non-frost-free freezer at −20°C until use.

Sections were cover-slipped with Vectashield (Vector Labs, Burlingame, USA) and stored at −20°C. Slides were observed on a Leica DMRD (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) fluorescence microscope equipped with filter sets that were designed for fluorescein isothiocyanate and Cy3. Sections from double-label experiments were observed on an inverted Zeiss Axiovert 100 M microscope equipped with the LSM 510 META laser scanning confocal module (Carl Zeiss Jena, Jena, Germany).
Two types of controls were performed. To control for unspecific labeling attributable to secondary antibodies, experiments were performed by omitting the primary antibody. This eliminated all labeling. To control for unspecific labeling attributable to the primary antibodies, preadsorption experiments were performed by mixing, in a 20-fold molar excess, a synthetic peptide having the amino acid sequence against which each mGluR antibody had been raised (see below) with the corresponding primary antibody overnight at 4°C. Incubation proceeded as previously described, with the same concentrations for the primary antisera. Labeling was also completely eliminated in these preadsorption controls.

Electron microscopy
The same fixation and cryoprotection procedures were used as described for light microscopy. The retinas were peeled off the filter and embedded in Tissue Tek (Sakura Finetek Europe, Zouterwoude, The Netherlands) in an aluminum boat. The boat was frozen in liquid nitrogen. Transverse frozen sections (30–40 μm thick) were obtained on a freezing microtome and collected in PB at room temperature (equivalent to freeze-thawing).

 supplemented with 1.5 % potassium ferricyanide in sodium cacodylate buffer 0.1 M (pH 7.4). After being rinsed in sodium cacodylate buffer, the material was dehydrated and embedded in epoxy resin. Ultrathin sections were observed in a Philips EM201 electron microscope (Philips, Eindhoven, The Netherlands) and/or Technai (CM) 12 electron microscope (FEI Company, Eindhoven, The Netherlands). Sections examined with the Philips electron microscope were counter-stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate.

Sampling and production of photomicrographs
At least 20 retinal sections obtained from a minimum of five animals were used for a given light microscopy or electron-microscopy experiment (i.e., single-immunolabeling at the light-microscopy level for mGluR1α). About five photomicrographs were taken from the most representative sections in each experiment.
Light micrographs of the single-label experiments were acquired as TIFF files directly from the Leica microscope by using a Leica 350 F digital B/W camera (1284×1028 pixels, 72 ppi). Light micrographs of the double-label experiments were acquired as TIFF files from the Zeiss LSM 510 META (1048×1024 pixels, 72 ppi).
n
 = 10–30) were taken from these sections, depending on the presence and amount of labeling.
Electron micrographs obtained with the FEI electron microscope were directly acquired as TIFF files (1024×1024 pixels, 72 ppi). Electron micrographs obtained from the Philips electron microscope were first printed from the negatives for analysis. The negatives of the prints that were selected for publication were scanned on a sprint scan 4000 scanner (Polaroid Nederland, Breda, The Netherlands) and acquired as TIFF files at 600 ppi.
All TIFF files were resampled at 400 ppi and subsequently re-sized and optimized for brightness and contrast by using Photoshop (Adobe Systems, San Jose, USA).

For sodium dodecyl-sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, samples were run through a polyacrylamide stacking gel at 20 mA and through a 13% polyacrylamide gel at 30 mA. Protein standards (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Veenendaal, The Netherlands) were run in adjacent lanes. Gels were electroblotted on a poly-vinylidene-di-fluoride blot membrane (Millipore) overnight at a constant current of 80 mA. After being rinsed with a 0.5 M TRIS buffer containing 1.5 M NaCl and 5% Tween 200, the membrane was blocked in the same buffer containing 2% dry milk for 1 h.
Subsequently, the membrane was incubated for 1 h in the primary antibodies (1:100), washed in the TRIS buffer, incubated in an HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:5000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, USA), and washed in PBS. The immunoreaction was visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham, Arlington Heights, USA) by using Kodak film. Exposures times were between 1 and 5 min.


Results
In this study, we aimed at a qualitative description of the mGluR composition in the goldfish OPL. To have a parameter for comparisons with regard to ON BC labeling with the antibodies against the various mGluRs, we first investigated the immunoreactivity pattern yielded by the PKC antibody, a widely used ON BC marker. Therefore, the labeling for PKC will be described first, followed by each of the mGluRs studied.

In the rod spherule, PKC labels invaginating dendrites of putative ON MBCs. The mGluR1α antibody labels similar structures and some lateral elements. Lateral elements of rod triads are also positive for mGluR7. Müller cell processes between the rod spherules are positive for mGluR5. We have found no evidence for mGluR2/3 in the rod synaptic complex.
In the cone pedicles, PKC labels fine dendrites at the base of the terminal or invaginating structures away from the ribbons. Elements at similar positions and with similar fine structure are positive for mGluR1α and mGluR7. BC central processes in the cone triads are positive for mGluR1α. Spinules are positive for mGluR1α and mGluR7, and lateral elements are labeled by the mGluR1α, mGluR2/3, and mGluR7 antibodies. Finally, HC central elements are positive for mGluR2/3.

). We also “BLASTed” the proteins retrieved from the zebrafish database against all other species available, in order to check for protein similarities among species.
To choose good candidates for fish mGluRs among the BLAST hits, we relied on the scores and E-values; the cutoff was E<0.01. We adopted a stringent significance level, because the chance of obtaining random matches with short amino acid sequences was relatively large. All scores used for these comparisons were higher than 1,000. For the C-terminal mGluR5 peptide, the cutoff was lowered to E=0.35, since no candidates could be found with the same stringency as for the remainder of the peptide sequences.

), but one of them had a slightly smaller molecular mass than the other two (85 kDa). We did not however detect multiple proteins around 80–100 kDa in our immunoblots, which suggested that XP_001341692 was not present in the goldfish retina.
According to the database search, the C-terminal peptides of mGluR5 and mGluR7 have one fish homolog each. The mGluR5 candidate shows lowest amino acid sequence similarity at the C-terminus, but the lack of overlapping expression patterns between mGluR1 and mGluR5 in the OPL of the goldfish retina excludes cross-reactivity of anti-mGluR5 and mGluR1.

We have found that lateral elements in the rod triads are positively labeled for mGluR1α and mGluR7. Since the labeling for mGluR1α is rare, we cannot at this point positively identify these processes as belonging to either rod-driven HCs or MBCs. In the cone pedicle, mGluRs seem to be expressed in a highly organized manner. mGluR1α and mGluR7 tend to be localized to spinules and to dendrites occupying the lateral position in the cone triad, whereas mGluR2/3 has been found at both lateral and central processes directly opposing the synaptic ribbon.

One would however expect these cells to express an mGluR6-like receptor, given the many physiological similarities between the rod-driven conductance in fish and mammalian ON BCs.
