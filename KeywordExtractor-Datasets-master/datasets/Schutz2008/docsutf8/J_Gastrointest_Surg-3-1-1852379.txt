 reported 5-year survival rates to be significantly higher at centers with high surgical volumes (96–205/year), when compared to very-low-volume hospitals (1–28 cases/year).
To determine if patients treated for gastric cancer at high-volume and specialized centers in the US had better postoperative outcomes, we analyzed the preoperative evaluation and surgical treatment of gastric adenocarcinoma at three categories of hospitals, defined by the Commission on Cancer (CoC), namely, the Community Hospital Cancer Program (CHCP), Community Hospital Comprehensive Cancer Program (COMP), and Teaching Hospital Cancer Program (THCP). Data collected for the 2001 Gastric Cancer Patient Care Evaluation (PCE) by the NCDB were utilized.

Material and Methods
NCDB, Data Source, Case Selection, and Data Handling
The NCDB is a project of the American College of Surgeons (ACS) CoC. The NCDB was established in 1989 to serve as a comprehensive clinical surveillance resource for all forms of cancer diagnosed in the US and its operations have been supported in part by the American Cancer Society. In 2001, the database captured 73% of all newly diagnosed cancer cases in the US.

Registry Operations and Data Standards, volume II
11
 The NCDB elements include patient characteristics: sex, age or date of birth, and race/ethnicity; tumor characteristics: primary site, histology, behavior, grade, and American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC), fifth edition stage groups; and first course of treatment: surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, and others. In addition to the annual call for data, a call for participation in a 2001 PCE was issued and 711 of the 1,423 CoC-approved institutions in the US responded. Cancer registrars were also asked to provide information describing additional diagnostic and treatment information, 30-day mortality, and patient comorbidities. Data quality checks were conducted at the local and the depository level.

Patient Population
The 2001 Gastric PCE included data submitted from 711 CoC-approved institutions in the US. Participating institutions submitted data for consecutive hospital admissions and clinic visits between January 1, 2001 and December 31, 2001. Patients eligible for participation had a “microscopically confirmed neoplasm of the stomach that was either diagnosed or initially treated at the reporting facility.” Of 7,084 total patients, 6,099 (86%) were diagnosed with gastric adenocarcinoma. For this study, 52 patients were excluded because they were treated at nine institutions without a specialized hospital type, leaving 6,047 patients at 691 cancer program types for evaluation. This group comprises the study population.

Cancer Program Categories
Cancer programs were characterized as CHCP, COMP, or THCP. Community Hospital Cancer Programs diagnose and/or treat 100–650 cancer patients every year and will commonly refer patients to other institutions for diagnostic evaluation or treatment. A CHCP has neither a medical school affiliation nor residency programs but does posses a medical oncology unit or functional equivalent and infrequently participates in cancer research. Community Hospital Comprehensive Cancer Programs diagnose and/or treat more than 650 cancer cases per year, but are not associated with a medical school. A COMP may make outside patient referrals, has a medical oncology unit, and participates in cancer research. Teaching Hospital Cancer Programs are defined as facilities associated with a medical school that participates in the training of residents in at least four fields, two of which are medicine and surgery. A THCP offers a full range of diagnostic and therapeutic services on site and has an in-patient medical oncology unit. A THCP hospital also participates in cancer-related clinical research and has board-certified medical oncologists.

 = 0.01 significance level, except where indicated. Where specific values were unknown, these cases were excluded from the analysis when appropriate.
A forward stepwise binary logistic regression model was used to evaluate the impact of age, stage, and comorbid burden on determination of type of treatment, i.e., the odds of “surgery, with or without other treatment” compared to the odds of nonsurgical treatment (radiation and/or chemotherapy). The Wald statistic was used to test significance. Exponentiated estimates of the beta coefficients were interpreted as the estimates for the effect (odds ratio) of a particular variable, controlling for the other variables in the equation. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was created to examine the prediction results. The true-positive probability was calculated to define the sensitivity of the classification rule and the true-negative probability was calculated to determine the specificity to summarize how well the model performed.

Confidentiality
Data reported to the NCDB are retrospective in nature. No patient or physician identifiers were collected as part of the study. Case identification information (facility identification number and local registry accession number) was collected for administrative purposes only. Analyses were reported only at the aggregate level to assist hospital cancer programs with quality assurance, rather than used to make decisions about individuals and their care.
The ACS has executed a business associate agreement that includes a data-use agreement, with each of its CoC-approved hospitals. Results reported in this study were in compliance with the privacy requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 as reported in the Standards for Privacy of Individually Identifiable Health Information; Final Rule (45 CFR Parts 160 and 164).

 analyzed a database of more than 55,000 patients and grouped them into the following time periods: 1975–1979, 1980–1984, 1985–1989, and 1990–1994. He found “positive relationships between hospital volume and 5-year survival” but over time the survival benefit seen at high-volume centers decreased and persisted in comparison with the very-low-volume centers.
24
 A limitation of this study is the fact that only 1 of the 22 hospitals was a university hospital and the others were “general hospitals.” Many of the participating hospitals were considered to be low-volume centers.
Interpretation of the Results
Our study had similar results to the aforementioned American, Japanese, and European studies. In this study, there was a marked improvement (>50%) in operative mortality at higher volume centers (≥14 cases/year) when compared to lowest volume institutions (≤5 cases/year). The average 30-day postoperative mortality at the low-volume community centers was almost 10%. The annual volume of gastric surgeries performed seems to be inversely related to 30-day postoperative mortality. On average 2.9, 5.5, and 7.6 gastric surgeries were reported from CHCPs, COMPs, and THCPs, respectively. Corresponding 30-day mortality was 9.9, 7.9, and 5.5%, respectively. There were no significant differences seen in postoperative morbidities such as wound infection and hemorrhage by hospital category. The logistical model revealed three predictors of perioperative mortality: stage IV disease, advanced age, and institution type. Patients that had surgery at a CHCP were twice as likely to die postoperatively compared to patients treated surgically at THCPs. Among those that died, there were no significant differences of stage or age at the different institutions.
Because the absolute differences in surgical case number among the hospital types were not vastly different, this observed difference in outcomes may be a reflection of the infrastructure of the institution rather than individualized surgeon skill. Centers affiliated with a medical school might have more experience with caring for the critically ill in the form of larger and better equipped intensive care units, resident and fellow coverage, newer technology, and more subspecialized physicians to help manage patient care. Unfortunately, we could not analyze the infrastructure for each hospital type nor look at surgeon-specific experience in this study as this was not a part of the study.
Clinical staging is affected by the sensitivity and specificity of the diagnostic studies performed during the preoperative evaluation. An assessment of staging at the different institutions revealed some major differences. Teaching hospitals were more likely to detect malignancy on a CT of the abdomen and pelvis than the other two hospital types. This might be a reflection on the quality of CT scans obtained and the experience of the radiologists. Preoperative utilization of endoscopic ultrasound was higher at teaching hospitals, a predictable finding given the recent adaptation of this technology and the expertise required to interpret these images.
25
26
 found that overall survival was largely dependent on the number of nodes examined and found an increase in survival when up to 40 lymph nodes was assessed. We found that teaching hospitals did a significantly better job meeting this recommendation; however, even at THCPs only 38.4% of patients had greater than 15 nodes assessed. The D1 lymphadenectomy was the most common operation for of nodal dissection, probably as a result of controlled Western surgical trials showing no survival benefit from a D2 dissection. Only a limited number of patients had any D2–D4 nodes resected and usually without a standardized extended lymphadenectomy. A notable observation was that the percentage of D2–D4 lymphadenectomy performed at THCPs was not higher than what was observed at COMPs or CHCPs.
To improve and obtain accurate surgical staging of gastric cancer patients, current practice will have to improve and will be dependent upon both the excision of nodes by the surgeon and their retrieval from the specimen by the pathologist. Given so few patients had 15 or more nodes removed at the time of surgery, regardless of hospital type, this practice could be improved by surgeons and pathologists working together to achieve the goal of identifying at least 15 nodes followed by the proper documentation of the microscopic evaluation of these nodes in the pathology report. If intraoperative pathologic evaluation of the surgical specimen is possible and the lymph node sampling is inadequate, the surgeon should excise additional lymph nodes.
A strength of this study is the large number of patients and hospitals included in the study. This broad sampling of hospitals leads to a close approximation of the current practice of gastric cancer treatment in the US. The main shortcoming is that many of the critical data categories had at least 20% “unknown” responses, and may have biased the reported results of this study. In addition, analysis of hospital infrastructure or surgeon volume was limited by lack data availability in the database. Another limitation is that the 5-year survival information has not yet been documented; these data will provide long-term outcome by type of treatment center.


Conclusion
Data from the Gastric PCE project suggests that there is significant room for improvement in the surgical management of gastric cancer in the US. Most hospitals, regardless of category, do not document the evaluation at least 15 lymph nodes necessary to meet AJCC standards. With a little over one third of all patients having more than 15 lymph nodes examined, pathologic staging is less accurate and results of surgical and adjuvant therapy are likely to be worse. Significantly more patients had appropriate staging with the recommended number of nodes included in the lymphadenectomy at teaching centers than at nonacademic centers. Thirty-day mortality rates after gastric cancer resection were significantly lower at teaching centers, further establishing the recommendation that complex oncologic operations should be performed at high-volume centers to obtain better patient outcomes, corroborating the results of several previous studies. Long-term survival data will provide more information on effectiveness of treatment at each of the different institution types.

DISCUSSION

Richard H. Bell, Jr. M. D. (Chicago Ill):
 Thank you, Dr. Reid-Lombardo. That was a nice presentation. This report deals with the thorny issue of where complex GI procedures are best done and by whom, and this is not an academic discussion, because in your data you suggest that there are about 500 preventable operative deaths per year in the United States for gastric cancer patients. The difficult question for me in all of this is identifying what is about large tertiary hospitals that results in better operative outcomes for complex GI cases. I think if we are going to argue for centralization, we need to understand the rationale for doing that. It is obviously a contentious issue.
So in this respect, I was disappointed a little bit with the way you examined your results, becaused you claimed that surgical volume predicts good outcomes, but this was really not a study of volume. You divided your hospitals based on structure and not on volume. You divided the hospitals based on their classification by the American College of Surgeons. And although you didn’t show it, there was data in the manuscript that showed there were actually significant volume overlaps between the three categories. It was certainly not a clean distinction by volume. Some of the less complex hospitals in your study did as many operations as the tertiary medical centers, although their average number was smaller. So I thought this study would have been more illuminating if, in addition to what you look at, you had looked at volume as an independent variable in addition to structure. You actually have an unusual study here in that you can look at both structure and volume. It may be that the structure of tertiary hospitals the better equipment, the higher performing ICUs, the resident coverage, all of these things are the primary driver of better outcomes.
From an educational point of view, this has implications in the sense that it would not do any good to do a better job of training community general surgeons to be more proficient in gastrectomy if the community hospitals is fundamentally a less capable environment for this type of operation. You have the data to lok at both structure and volume, and I wish you had done that perhaps in the future manuscript you will. Thank you.
Kaye Reid-Lombardo, M. D. (Rochester, Minn)
 Thank you, Dr. Bell. I definitely agree with you that it is less about volume, especially with gastric cancer, because, you are right, even at teaching hospitals the volumes are not that high. I think it has more to do with the infrastructure at each institution, as is being reported by many authors as well. I think factors such as ICU availability or the radiologic availability at each institution have more of an impact than the surgeon in and of him or herself. So I think this study will allow us to further examine things like infrastructure and see what the differences are and to make better recommendations based on that examination.
Michael A. Choti, M. D. (Baltimore, Md)
 Dr. Reid-Lombardo, I enjoyed your presentation and thank you for the opportunity to have reviewed the manuscript in advance. This is just another example of how the National Cancer Database can be a useful tool for analyzing a variety of cancer mangement question. This database is robust and different from SEER or other databases. I encourage others to utilize this resource.
I have two questions. The first, you report a surprisingly low number of palliative gastrectomies, yet you define this as margin positive resection and not based on symptomatic indications. While it is uncommon to have both proximal and distal positive margins, even in palliative resections, it is more common to have noncurative or R2 gastrectomy. In such cases the margins may be negative but residual disease is left behind as nodes or peritoneal implants. Were you able to see the difference between the margin positive and R2 resection?
The second question relates to the number of lymph nodes evaluated in this series. As you know, guidelines recommend histologic evaluation of at least 15 nodes. It was interesting how few gastrectomies in fact achieve greater 15 nodes. This number is significantly less than even colorectal cancer, where much attention has recently been given. Do you think in this case it is the pathologist diligence as much as the extent of lymphadenectomy that is the problem? Or are we setting the bar to high with the recommendation of 15 or more nodes? Thank you.
Dr. Reid-Lombardo:
 Thank you for questions. To answer your first question, it aws difficult to analyze R2, and so that is why we difficult to analyze R2, and so that is why we evaluated based on margin status. I would have expected a higher palliative rate as well. We could not analyze that from the database. I think to improve on the lymph node sampling , the pathologist and surgeon must work hand in hand. The pathologist should analyze the resected specimen at the time that the surgeon is still in the operating room and provide feedback. If there are less than 15 nodes, then more node sampling should be done by the surgeon. Now, I know the western studies have not shown improved survival among patients with D1 and D2 rescted nodes, but sampling more nodes would almost seem to me to assure that we are doing a more extended lymphadenectomy. One way that we can achieve that goal is to have better discussion, and not only discussion, but the pathology report should clearly indicate how many nodes have been examined and how many are positive or negative. Thank you.
