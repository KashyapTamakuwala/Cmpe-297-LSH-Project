 parasitaemia 10.9% and HIV 11.9%. Anaemia showed little association with the presence of any helminth, but showed a strong association with malaria (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 3.22, 95% CI 2.43–4.26) and HIV (AOR 2.46, 95% CI 1.90–3.19). There was a weak association between anaemia and increasing hookworm infection intensity. Thus, although highly prevalent, helminths showed little association with mild-to-moderate anaemia in this population, but HIV and malaria both showed a strong association. This result may relate to relatively good nutrition and low helminth infection intensity. These findings are pertinent to estimating the disease burden of helminths and other infections in pregnancy.

). Although praziquantel had been widely avoided in pregnant and lactating women, it was noted that there was no evidence from studies in animals, from case reports or from mass treatment campaigns in humans of any major adverse effects. Treatment of schistosomiasis during pregnancy was therefore advocated by the Consultation Committee.
Elliott et al., 2007
). Anaemia is among the secondary outcomes of the trial. The trial is ongoing. In view of current interest in the role of helminths in anaemia during pregnancy, we have examined associations between anaemia and helminths and other major infections (malaria and HIV) among pregnant women at enrolment into the trial.

Materials and methods
2.1
Study population and procedures
The study area comprises Entebbe Municipality and the adjacent subcounty of Katabi. This area supports semi-urban, rural and fishing communities residing on the Entebbe peninsula in Lake Victoria, Uganda. Women were recruited at the antenatal clinic at Entebbe Hospital between April 2003 and November 2005.
Women were assessed for screening at their first antenatal visit, thus initial screening could take place in any trimester of pregnancy. They were eligible for screening if they were well, resident in the study area, planning to deliver their baby at the hospital, willing to participate and willing to know their HIV status. On the screening day, after giving written informed consent, eligible women were interviewed regarding sociodemographic characteristics and risk factors for helminth infection, malaria and HIV and were examined by a midwife. A blood sample was obtained for investigations including haemoglobin (Hb) estimation, examination for microfilariae (mf) and malaria parasites, syphilis and HIV serology.
Screened women were asked to return for enrolment within 1 month with a stool sample. They were excluded from enrolment if they had a Hb level <8 g/dl, clinically apparent severe liver disease, diarrhoea with blood in the stool, an abnormal pregnancy, a history of adverse reaction to anthelminthic drugs or had already participated in the study during an earlier pregnancy. Women were enrolled in the trial when they returned with a stool sample if they were in the second or third trimester and full eligibility was confirmed.
All women received routine antenatal care including haematinics and intermittent presumptive treatment for malaria using sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine. Women were treated for syphilis and provided with nevirapine for prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission, if indicated. Women who were excluded from the study on grounds of severe anaemia were treated with albendazole and haematinics and referred for transfusion if required.

2.2
Haemoglobin estimation and definition of anaemia
Hb was estimated at the antenatal clinic using a colorimetric haemoglobinometer (DHT haemoglobin meter; Developing Health Technology, Barton Mills, UK) with same-day results. The same sample was then sent to the Medical Research Council/Uganda Virus Research Institute (MRC/UVRI) laboratories for analysis by a Coulter analyser (Beckman Coulter AC-T 5 diff CP; Beckman Coulter, Nyon, Switzerland). Quality control for the Coulter analyser was provided through the United Kingdom National External Quality Assessment Schemes, with consistently good results. Initial evaluation suggested that the haemoglobinometer results reliably matched the Coulter analyser results (intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) = 0.81, 95% CI 0.74–0.88) and the immediately available haemoglobinometer results were used to determine enrolment. Evaluation of results to March 2005 showed less reliability (ICC = 0.54, 95% CI 0.51–0.58) and it was noted that 37 women had been enrolled with haemoglobinometer results >8 g/dl but Coulter analyser values below this cut-off; thereafter, Coulter analyser results were used for enrolment. Coulter analyser results have been used in this analysis.

 intensity, therefore arbitrary categories were defined to obtain approximately equal numbers of participants in each category: light <30 mf/ml, moderate 30–99 mf/ml, high ≥100 mf/ml.

2.4
HIV serology
HIV serology was performed using a rapid test algorithm with same-day results. Testing kits, provided by the Ministry of Health, varied with availability. Most commonly, Determine (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Japan Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) was used for screening, with positive results confirmed by Unigold (Trinity Biotech plc, Bray, Ireland). Samples with differing results were referred for analysis by non-rapid ELISA tests or were examined using a ‘tie-breaker’ rapid test, usually Statpack (Chembio Diagnostic Systems, Medford, NY, USA). A proportion of samples, including all those with differing results by rapid test, were re-examined at the MRC/UVRI laboratories for quality control, with high agreement of the results.

Continuous variables for anaemia (Hb level) and infection intensity (egg or parasite count) were then used to examine effects of intensity in more detail among infected participants using linear regression. Adjustment was made for the same potential confounders in logistic and linear regression models.

Results
A total of 15 035 women registered at the antenatal clinic during the recruitment period, of whom 11 783 were assessed for inclusion in the study and 3163 were considered eligible and screened. The commonest reasons for ineligibility were residence outside the study area (6243), unwillingness to have an HIV test (1186), unwillingness to join the study (874) and enrolment during an earlier pregnancy (115). Of the 3163 screened, 2515 were enrolled; 8 of these were subsequently excluded because they had been enrolled during a previous pregnancy. Of the 648 women screened but not enrolled, the majority (596) failed to return for enrolment and only 15 brought a stool sample. Since intestinal helminth infection detected by stool analysis was a focus of interest, this analysis was confined to the 2507 women who were enrolled in the trial and for whom all or almost all relevant data were available.
3.1
Characteristics of the study women
Maternal age ranged from 14 years to 47 years (mean 23.6 years). The majority were Baganda (49.1%), the predominant tribe of the district. Most (83.8%) were married, with 13.4% single, 0.6% widows and 2.3% divorced or separated. Education varied from none (3.9%), to primary (50.5%), secondary (37.3%) and tertiary (8.4%) and most women were poor (85.1% with a personal income of less than £10 per month). Primigravidae comprised 27.7% of the women studied.

 malaria parasitaemia was 10.9% and HIV infection 11.9%.
The prevalence of anaemia (Hb < 11.2 g/dl) was 39.7%. Six women were enrolled in error with Hb < 8 g/dl by both methods (Coulter analyser results 5.6–7.9 g/dl). These, as well as the 37 women enrolled prior to March 2005 with haemoglobinometer results above but Coulter analyser results below 8 g/dl, have been retained in this analysis.

Associations between characteristics of pregnant women and anaemia in pregnancy

. The prevalence of anaemia declined with age. Anaemia was associated with tribe, with Basoga most likely to be anaemic. Anaemia showed no association with women's socioeconomic index, but low household socioeconomic status was associated with anaemia. Primigravidae were more likely to be anaemic than multigravidae.

), we conducted a sensitivity analysis to estimate the effect of hookworm if all women with Hb < 8 g/dl and no stool result had hookworm. The result was in keeping with a possible effect of hookworm, but after adjusting for confounding factors the effect was small. Associations between anaemia and malaria and between anaemia and HIV infection were similar in enrolled and excluded women.

 and intensity does not suffer from this limitation: repeat examinations among 1971 women showed 96% agreement for the binary variable (infected/uninfected), with an ICC for mf/ml of 0.87 (95% CI 0.85–0.88) (unpublished data).
Not all pregnant women in Entebbe attend the district hospital antenatal clinic, but a community survey undertaken in the study area showed an increase in the proportion choosing this clinic during the recruitment period, to approximately 80%, and most of the personal and socioeconomic characteristics of women choosing, or not choosing, to attend the district hospital clinic were similar (unpublished data). Thus, our results are likely to be reasonably representative of pregnant women in this area.
