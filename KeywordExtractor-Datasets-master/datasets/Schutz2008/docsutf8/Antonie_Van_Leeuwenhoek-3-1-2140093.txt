The selectivity and specificity of this method were demonstrated through discriminating localization of extracellular (i.e., in the zone of contact with host cells) vs. integral membrane domains of LppQ. Thus, our findings support the suggestion that the accessible N-terminal domain of LppQ is surface exposed and such surface localization may be implicated in the pathogenesis of CBPP.

After fixation, samples were washed with PBS buffer and blocked with 1% BSA and 0.2 M glycine in PBS for 15 min at room temperature. Thereafter, mycoplasma cells were incubated with anti-LppQ-N’ or anti-LppQ-C’ IgGs diluted 1:100 (30 μg/ml) in PBS containing 1% BSA overnight at 4°C. After another washing step with PBS buffer for 5–10 min, mycoplasmas were labelled with 15 nm colloidal gold-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (British Biocell International, Cardiff, UK) diluted 1:50 in PBS for 90 min at room temperature. Coverslips were then washed with 0.1 M cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4) and processed for SEM.

Samples were examined without further metal coating. Secondary electron micrographs and corresponding backscattered images were obtained with a fully digital field emission scanning electron microscope DSM 982 Gemini (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) at an accelerating voltage of 5 kV, a working distance of 6–8 mm and a magnification from 50,000 to 100,000×.
Control experiments included omission of primary antibody as well as the use of a rabbit anti-calcitonin antibody (Anawa, Zurich, Switzerland) and of IgGs from rabbit pre-immune sera as irrelevant substitutes for the anti-LppQ primary antibodies.

High resolution scanning electron microscopy in combination with immunogold labelling revealed extracellular epitopes with antibodies against LppQ-N′ but no signal above the background of the three negative controls was detected with the antibody against LppQ-C′. These results substantiate the predicted localization of the two domains, as they unambiguously corroborate the accessibility of the N-terminal domain at the extracellular side of the plasma membrane. The failure to immunolabel the C-terminal epitopes is an indication that they may be imbedded in the membrane. However, one cannot rule out the possibility that such epitopes (i) are buried in the centre of a globular protein, (ii) are masked by other surface components or (iii) are not recognized in their native forms by rabbit antibodies produced by inoculation of the recombinant peptide. Beyond providing ultrastructural evidence for the location of the hydrophilic and hydrophobic domains of LppQ, these results also demonstrate that immunogold labelling in scanning electron microscopy allows for subtle topographical discrimination and that selective visualization of peptides being exposed at the outer surface of microorganisms can be achieved with high accuracy and reliability.
