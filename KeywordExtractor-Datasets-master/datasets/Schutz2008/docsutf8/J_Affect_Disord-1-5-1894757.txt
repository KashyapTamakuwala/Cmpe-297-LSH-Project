Abstract
Background
Rates of prenatal and postnatal depression in developing countries are high. Prolonged depression during the postnatal period is associated with impaired infant growth and development. Little is known about the factors predicting the persistence of prenatal depression beyond the first few postnatal months.

Methods
n
 = 160). Depressed women were re-assessed at 3, 6 and 12 months postnatal. Persistently depressed women (depressed at all time points) were compared with the remainder. Psychiatric symptoms, disability and life events were measured using the Self-Reporting Questionnaire (SRQ), Brief Disability Questionnaire (BDQ), and a modified Life Events Checklist.

Results
Of 129 mothers who completed follow-up, 73 (56%) were depressed at all points of assessment. These persistently depressed mothers had higher SRQ and BDQ scores prenatally and had experienced more life events in the year preceding the third pregnancy trimester than the mothers whose depressive disorder resolved (none received treatment). Persistent depression was significantly associated also with poverty, having 5 or more children, an uneducated husband and lack of a confidant or friend. On multivariate analysis, higher SRQ score and poverty during pregnancy predicted persistent depression.

Limitations
The sample was from one rural sub-district only. We did not assess the women for physical conditions such as anaemia and thyroid-deficiency.

Conclusion
Women who are poor and have more psychological symptoms during pregnancy are more likely to remain depressed one year after giving birth. This study highlights the need for developing mechanisms of early identification and suitable psychosocial interventions to minimise the damaging effects of persistent postnatal depression in poor communities.

). The outcome is worse in infants whose mothers remained persistently depressed from the third trimester throughout the first postnatal year. It is, therefore, important to predict which mothers, depressed prenatally, are likely to remain depressed throughout the next year.

), we assessed 632 women in rural Pakistan and found that 160 (25%) of the sample had ICD-10 Depressive disorder. In this paper, we present the results of the one-year follow-up of those mothers who were depressed in the third trimester of pregnancy.

Method

Study area, subjects and sampling
n
Fig. 1
). Subjects were identified by obtaining official lists from 120 government-employed Lady Health Workers (LHWs) working in the area, who routinely collect data on new pregnancies. Six-hundred and seventy out of 701 (95%) agreed to take part. Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects after the procedure had been fully explained. Fourteen (2%) were excluded because of a physical illness or complication of pregnancy, 21 (3%) had anxiety disorder and 3 (0.5%) had learning disability and were excluded. Out of the remaining, 160 were diagnosed with ICD-10 Depressive Episode, giving a prevalence rate of depressive disorder in the prenatal period (T1) of 25%. Out of these 160, four had infants born prematurely and were excluded from this study. Two mothers discontinued due to severity of depression. Ten mothers had stillbirths or neonatal deaths, and 1 newborn had a congenital abnormality and were excluded. Fourteen subjects dropped out of the study. Thus, one hundred and twenty-9 mothers were assessed at 3 months (T2), 6 months (T3) and 12 months (T4) postnatal.

). This consists of twenty items designed to identify psychological symptoms associated with anxiety and depression. Each item has a yes/no answer. The time span refers to the individual's feelings over the past 30 days. Each item is scored 0 or 1. The maximum score is therefore 20.
VonKorff et al., 1996
VonKorff et al., 1996
).
Socio-demographic variables (age, education, employment, family structure and composition) were assessed at T1 by the same interviewers using a specially designed Personal Information Questionnaire (PIQ). Education was categorised into no education versus at least four years primary education. Four years of schooling was chosen as a cut-off because many Pakistani female children attend primary school for four years, after which many children from low-income families stop attending. Family structure was categorised into nuclear family (parents and children only) or extended family (three generations, or one or both parents with married sons, their wives and children).
Socioeconomic status was assessed at T1 by inquiring if the household was in debt and by asking Lady Health Workers, who lived in the same locality and had intimate knowledge of the families being studied, to rate the household on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (richest) to 5 (poorest). A single dichotomous variable of ‘poverty’ was created by combining these 2 measures, i.e., subjects who were both in debt and rated below 3 on the socioeconomic 5-point Likert scale were classified as being poor.
Maternal financial empowerment within the household was measured at T1 by asking the mothers if they were given a lump-sum amount of money for day-to-day household expenses, and whether they could take independent decisions about its use. Mothers who answered ‘yes’ to both questions were classified as financially empowered within the household. Social support was assessed by inquiring if the woman received any support during pregnancy from relatives or friends.
Brown and Harris, 1989
Husain et al., 2000
). Based on the data from this study, 9 types of events or difficulties that accounted for the majority of the severe events and difficulties reported in that population were used in a modified semi-structured interview. We recorded only those events and difficulties which rated as severe according to the Brown and Harris Rating Scale. In order to do this we discussed the context in which they occurred with the local lady health worker (who lived in the same community and had intimate knowledge of the families being studied).

Sample characteristics
and
 rated below 3 by the LHWs and were classified as ‘poor’ in this study.
Nine percent were primigravid, 16% already had one child, 21% two children, 17% three children and the remaining 37% had three or more. Thirty-seven percent lived in nuclear families (parents and children only) while the remaining lived in extended families (three generations, or one or both parents with married sons, their wives and children). Fifty-seven percent delivered at home with a traditional birth attendant, 98% without any reported complication. The gender of newborns was equally distributed.
Of the 129 women, 121 (94%) were depressed at 3 months, 98 (76%) at 6 months and 80 (62%) at 12 months. Eighty out of 129 (62%) mothers depressed during the third trimester of pregnancy were still depressed at 12 months postnatally but 7 of these had not been depressed at 6 months; thus 73 (57%) were depressed at all time points.

). Therefore, prolonged maternal depression has serious consequences not only for the mother but also for infant growth and development.
O'Hara et al. (1984)
Campbell and Cohn (1997)
 followed up 70 women meeting the criteria for clinical depression at 2 months postnatal and found that at 4 months postnatal, 48% continued to be depressed; at 6 months 30% and at 12 months, 24% continued to meet the criteria for depression.
Beeghly et al. (2002)
Rubertsson et al. (2005)
Najman et al., 2000
). In our study, prevalence of antenatal depression is high and comparatively fewer women recover in the first year after childbirth.
Horowitz and Goodman (2004)
Bernazzani et al. (1997)
Yonkers et al. (2001)
 found that persistent postnatal depressive symptoms were linked with the presence of other young children at home. In the current study, multivariate analyses suggested poverty to be the major predictor of persistence of depression after severity of depressive symptoms in the prenatal period was adjusted for.
Patel et al., 2002
Rahman et al., 2003a,b
). The preference for male children is deeply rooted in South Asia. Women are often blamed for the birth of girls. However, this study suggests that the effects of having a female child on the mother's mood may only be transient. Similarly, lack of social support during pregnancy (in terms of assistance provided in daily activities) was not associated with persistence while lack of a confidant or friend was. It may be that there are qualitative differences in the type of social support that predicts a worse outcome of depression, and studies using better measures of social support may be required.
While only physically healthy mothers were included in the study, we did not include any physical measures to screen mothers for common physical problems such as anaemia or iodine-deficiency. However, chronic malnutrition in the mothers indicated by a low body-mass index was not significantly associated with persistent depression. Other limitations include a relatively small sample size and the fact that all the women came from one sub-district of Rawalpindi.
Husain et al., 2000; Mirza and Jenkins, 2004
). Other longitudinal studies would be required to try and understand the origins of depression in these women, which may well pre-date the first pregnancy, or even have its onset in adolescence. However, the postnatal period assumes importance because of the impact of maternal depression on the infant's development. Thus, early identification of mothers whose depression is likely to persist and providing extra support could improve outcomes in both mothers and their infants.
O'Hara and Swain, 1996; Beck, 2001
Bernazzani et al., 1997; Verkerk et al., 2003
) not only predict early postnatal depression but are also associated with persistence of depression. The utility of the SRQ-20 in predicting persistent depression suggests that this questionnaire, which has been specifically developed for use in primary care in developing countries, could also serve as a useful screening instrument during the antenatal period.
