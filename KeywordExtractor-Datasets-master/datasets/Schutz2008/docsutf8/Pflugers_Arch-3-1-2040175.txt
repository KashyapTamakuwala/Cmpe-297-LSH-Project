, leads to a marked recruitment of HIF-1α in human adipocytes and that expression of the GLUT1 facilitative glucose transporter in adipocytes is hypoxia-sensitive. Importantly, the expression and secretion of several adipokines, including FIAF/angiopoietin-like protein 4, IL-6, leptin, MIF and VEGF, is stimulated by hypoxia in human adipocytes, while adiponectin and haptoglobin are inhibited.

Materials and methods
Human adipocyte culture
Human subcutaneous preadipocytes, derived from adipose tissue pooled from seven female subjects, were obtained (together with culture media) from Zen-Bio (USA). The patients had a mean body mass index of 25 (range 22.5–28.2) and average age of 41 years (range 27–51 years).

). The cells were harvested in 700 μl of Trizol (Invitrogen, UK) or 150 μl of lysis buffer per well at the stated time points. Media were collected and centrifuged at 1,000 rpm for 10 min to remove cell debris and the supernatant stored at −20°C until required for analysis. All incubations at each time point were performed in replicates of up to six wells.

RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis
Total RNA was isolated from cells using Trizol, and 1 μg of RNA was treated with DNase I (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA concentration was quantified from the absorbance at 260 nm; all samples had a 260/280 nm absorbance ratio of 1.7–1.9.

Real-time PCR

Typically, the amplification started with 2 min at 50°C, 10 min at 95°C and then 40 cycles of the following: 15 s at 95°C and 1 min at 60°C.

Adiponectin, IL-6, leptin, MIF and VEGF were measured in cell culture media using commercial ELISA kits (R&D Systems). The assays were conducted in 96-well microplates according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Measurement of HIF-1α by Western blotting
Samples were prepared as described above for the HIF-1α ELISA assay. Fifteen micrograms of protein were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membranes were blocked and probed with polyclonal goat anti-human HIF-1α (R&D Systems) or mouse monoclonal anti-α-tubulin (Sigma, UK) as the primary antibody, then subjected to HRP-conjugated anti-goat IgG (R&D systems) or anti-mouse IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as the secondary antibody. Specific proteins were visualised with the enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Amersham, UK).

This phenomenon presumably reflects an adaptation of glucose metabolism to hypoxic conditions, with a marked stimulation of glycolysis in the face of a fall in aerobic metabolism.
