 infection under greenhouse and field conditions. Using the wheat cultivar Bobwhite, we developed one, two, and four lines carrying the α-1-purothionin, tlp-1, and β-1,3-glucanase transgenes, respectively, that had statistically significant reductions in FHB severity in greenhouse evaluations. We tested these seven transgenic lines under field conditions for percent FHB disease severity, deoxynivalenol (DON) mycotoxin accumulation, and percent visually scabby kernels (VSK). Six of the seven lines differed from the nontransgenic parental Bobwhite line for at least one of the disease traits. A β-1,3-glucanase transgenic line had enhanced resistance, showing lower FHB severity, DON concentration, and percent VSK compared to Bobwhite. Taken together, the results showed that overexpression of defense response genes in wheat could enhance the FHB resistance in both greenhouse and field conditions.

As part of our effort to increase variation for genetic resistance to FHB and to understand the relationship between defense response gene expression and FHB resistance, we produced wheat plants carrying a wheat α-1-purothionin, a barley tlp-1, or a barley β-1,3-glucanase transgene. We evaluated these plants against FHB under greenhouse and field conditions. Our results show that the overexpression of α-1-purothionin, tlp-1, or β-1,3-glucanase in wheat results in enhanced resistance to FHB.

RNA isolation and transcript analysis
RNA was isolated from leaf tissue using the Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) as per manufacturers’ instructions. RNA was subjected to RT-PCR based on the protocol accompanying the Calypso RT-PCR kit (GenSys Ltd., Farnborough, UK) using primers synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies Inc. (Coralville, IA). The 5′ sense primer was a maize ubiquitin promoter sequence (5′-GATGCATATACATGATGGCATATGCAG-3′) and the 3′ antisense primers were oligonucleotides that corresponded to defense response gene coding sequences for α-1-purothionin (5′-GTTACAGAAATTGACACAAGCATCGCC-3′), tlp-1 (5′-GACAGAAGGTGATCTGGTAGTTATTATT-3′) and β-1,3-glucanase (5′-GATGTTCACGGCAGGGTAGT-3′ and 5′-GCCACGTCCGTCATGTAGGCGTTC-3′). A wheat actin gene (GenBank accession number AB181991) with the primer sequences 5′-GCCACACTGTTCCAATCTATGA-3′ and 5′-TGATGGAATTGTATGTCGCTTC-3’ was used as a positive control. Sizes for the amplified products from the α-1-purothionin and tlp-1 transgenes were 600 and 805, respectively. Sizes for the two primers for the β-1,3-glucanase transgene were 577 and 777 bp. Size for the wheat actin gene was 369 bp.

Disease severity was assessed at 20 days after inoculation by counting the number of infected spikelets and expressing the infection level as a percentage of the total number of spikelets for each spike. Bobwhite, Wheaton, and Sumai 3 were used as checks in each greenhouse test.

Entries were established in two-row plots; rows were 2.4 m (8 ft) long and were spaced 0.3 m (1 ft) apart. Within rows, seed was planted at a rate of 3.3 g of seed/m. Alsen, 2375, Roblin and Wheaton were also included in the experiment as disease response checks. Additional plantings of noninoculated Wheaton were included in the field trial to determine the level of disease.

After micro-centrifugation at 4°C, full speed, for 5 min, supernatant protein measurements were conducted using Biorad reagent (Biorad) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Extracts containing 10 μg protein were used to determine the amount of transgenic protein present in transgenic lines using Western blotting.
Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE using 12% gels, transferred to PVDF-PLUS transfer membrane (Micron Separations Inc., Westborough, MA) and cross reacted with an affinity-purified polyclonal antibody (1:1000 dilution of supplied material). The tlp-1 and β-1,3-glucanase antibodies were provided by Quality Controlled Biochemicals Inc., Hopkinton, MA. For tlp-1, two peptides (QAYQHPNDVATHAC and CINVPAG TQAGRIWAR) were used to raise the antibody. For β-1,3-glucanase, one peptide (CGLFNPDKSPAYNIQF) was used to raise the antibody. Protein was visualized using an ECF Western Blotting Reagent Pack (rabbit) (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ), and fluorescence detection was carried out using a Storm 840 (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Specificity of β-1,3-glucanase and tlp-1 antibodies was confirmed through cross-reacting the antibodies with the peptides on Western blots.

 Version 9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Analyses of variance were performed using PROC MIXED procedure. The statistical model included genotype, year and genotype-by-year interactions as fixed factors, and replication nested within year as a random factor was used as an error term for testing year effect. For each experiment, homogeneity of variances among genotypes was checked for each trait using PROC UNIVARIATE. For each trait, when variances were found to be more than four times different from each other A REPEATED/GROUP = statement of PROC MIXED was used to account for the heterogeneity of variances. Least square means and pairwise comparisons between means were obtained using LSMEANS and PDIFF options.

). In general, these studies show that partial resistance can be achieved from over-expressing defense response genes in plants. In this study, we defined enhanced resistance as exhibiting a reduction in any of the three disease parameters. To date, there are no reports of commercially practical levels of fungal resistance derived from over-expressing defense response genes.

). For their field study, these authors used inoculated corn kernels, which provided a continuous source of inoculum, whereas in our field study, we sprayed fungal spores on the spikes twice. Thus, there is a distinct difference in the inoculation methodology between the two studies, which could lead to different disease reactions. Developmental differences such as the timing of flowering have resulted in different disease reactions to FHB. When inoculated grain is used for the inoculum, early heading plants can exhibit greater susceptibility than late heading plants as they are exposed to the inoculum for a longer period of time. In our study, we controlled the timing of inoculation through spraying the spikes, and we did not observe any obvious developmental differences in our transgenic lines. Thus, our results demonstrate that enhanced resistance to FHB can be obtained through overexpressing defense response genes.
