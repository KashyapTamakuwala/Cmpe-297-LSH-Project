 mutations and polymorphisms (details from the author upon request). All aberrations were confirmed with genomic sequence analysis, performed using the ABI PRISM BigDyeTerminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit Version 3.1 (Applied Biosystems, Nieuwerkerk a/d yssel, The Netherlands). Sequencing products were analysed with the ABI PRISM 3700 DNA Analyzer and corresponding software.

Statistical analysis

]. We compared the mutation frequency between UBC and CBC and between CBC cases previously treated with RT and cases not-treated with RT. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CI were calculated to evaluate the association between mutation carriers status and breast cancer risk. We have used the Mann–Whitney test to determine whether the difference between the intervals between the two breast cancers of the CBC patients was significant. All analyses were performed using SPSS 12.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).

 = 0.029). These data suggest that carrier-ship of an ATM missense variant may accelerate the development of a second tumour and decreases the age at onset of the second breast tumour, especially in case of exposure to RT.
The suggestion of a shorter induction period of RT-associated breast cancer in patients, who carry an ATM missense mutation, while the proportion of patients with missense variants was similar in CBC and UBC cases, might be attributable to a different spectrum of mutations in those patients who developed CBC. A big challenge in such a study remains to assess which particular missense mutations have an impact on ATM function. Large association studies, as performed by the Breast Cancer Association Consortium (coordinated by Doug Easton and Paul Pharoah, Cambridge), and functional studies are clearly necessary to determine the importance of particular variants and their contribution to the breast cancer risk.
