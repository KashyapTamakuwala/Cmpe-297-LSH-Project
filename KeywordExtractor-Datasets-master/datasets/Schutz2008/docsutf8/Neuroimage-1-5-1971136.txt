Abstract
Newer MRI methods can detect cerebral abnormalities not identified on routine imaging in patients with focal epilepsy. Correlation of MRI with histopathology is necessary to understand the basis of MRI abnormalities and subsequently predict histopathology from in vivo MRI. The aim of this study was to determine if particular quantitative MR parameters were associated with particular histological features.
Nine patients with temporal lobe epilepsy were imaged at 1.5 T using standard presurgical volumetric and quantifiable sequences: magnetization transfer and FFT2. The resected temporal lobe was registered with the volumetric MRI data according to our previously described method to permit correlation of the modalities. Stereologically measured neuronal densities and field fraction of GFAP, MAP2, synaptophysin and NeuN immunohistochemistry were obtained. Analyses were performed in the middle temporal gyrus and compared with quantitative MRI data from the equivalent regions.

 = 0.028). There were no significant correlations between any neuropathological and MR measures in white matter.
These preliminary findings suggest that T2 in gray matter is sensitive to the proportion of neuronal tissue. Novel quantitative MRI measures acquired with higher field strength magnets, and so with superior signal to noise ratios, may generate data that correlate with histopathological measures. This will enable better identification and delineation of the structural causes of refractory focal epilepsy, and will be of particular benefit in patients in whom current optimal MRI does not identify a relevant abnormality.

Thus, there is a pressing need for further developments in MRI, such as higher field strengths to improve signal-to-noise ratio, and newer sequences that may better pick out culpable neuropathological lesions in the neocortex.
Cascino et al., 1991; Van Paesschen et al., 1995
). For the more recently developed MR contrasts, the correlation between MR parameters and the underlying neocortical structure is not well understood and it is important for this to be clarified if these contrasts are to contribute to presurgical evaluation.
Thom et al., 2005
Eriksson et al., 2005
). Thus, quantitative MRI data and quantitative histopathological data can be directly compared. In this study we compared the data obtained using two quantitative MRI contrasts, T2 relaxation time maps (T2); and magnetization transfer ratio (MTR), with quantitative neuropathological data from the resected material. The aim was to explore the clinical utility of T2 and MTR and determine if particular quantitative MR parameters were associated with particular histological features.

Methods
Subjects
Eriksson et al., 2005
). The study was approved by the Joint Research Ethics Committee of the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery and Institute of Neurology, UCL. All patient and control subjects gave written informed consent to participate in the study.
The age range of subjects was 31–46 years (median 36 years) and 4 were male. Seven had a right anterior temporal lobe resection, and two had surgery on the left. The surgical procedure was selected after our standard presurgical work-up, including EEG-video telemetry, conventional MRI (T1- and T2-weighted, proton density and FLAIR), psychological and psychiatric assessments and multi-disciplinary case conference.
Salmenpera et al., 2007
). Twenty-nine volunteers served as a control population for the analysis of T2 maps and 26 volunteers for MTR.

MR acquisition
All scans were acquired on the same 1.5 T GE Signa MR scanner (GE Medical Systems, Milwaukee, WI). The T1-weighted volume sequence from the conventional scan protocol for all subjects was required for the MR:pathology correlation. The sequence parameters were: TE/TR/TI/NEX, 4.2/15/450/1; flip angle 20°; acquisition matrix 256 × 192; field of view 24 × 18 cm; 3/4 phase FOV, 124 contiguous 1.5 mm slices, giving a voxel size of 0.94 × 1.25 × 1.5 mm.
Subjects had two additional scans to generate quantitative MR data:

Quantitative MR values were obtained by overlaying a region of interest on the quantitative MR data. The mean intensity value of all voxels within the region of interest was calculated.

MR:pathology visual correlation
Eriksson et al., 2005
). Briefly, after fixation the resected temporal lobe was sliced in 5 mm blocks perpendicular to the maximum linear extent of the superior temporal sulcus. The MR volume data were rotated and reformatted into an oblique coronal plane that matched the orientation of these blocks. These oblique coronal images were visually inspected in comparison to the pathological blocks. Using standardized criteria, the best fit MRI slice for any one pathological block was identified and matches for adjacent blocks of tissue ensued. Two raters (SF and SE) performed this task separately and reached a consensus in any case with discrepancy.
All subjects had post-operative MRI scans to indicate the extent of the resection.

) and was present in tissue which had been resected in all 9 subjects. Since ROI1 and all quantitative MRI data used for the SPM analyses were normalized to SPM space, quantitative MTR and T2 data could be achieved by superimposing ROI1 on each case's normalized MTR and T2 data.

We also defined a region in the pathological data and determined its MR characteristics. To achieve this, the MRI volume data were segmented in subject space using intensity thresholding and manual drawing in Analyze AVW 5.0 (BIR, Mayo Clinic, Minnesota). The entire resection volume and the middle temporal gyrus within the resection volume were extracted by manual drawing guided by visual inspection of the previously determined MR:pathology correlation. Intensity thresholding and visual inspection were used to separate gray and white matter. A final manual segmentation step was used to separate the gray matter of the gyral crown (ROI2), from the gray matter in the rest of the middle temporal gyrus. This step used similar criteria to characterize the limits of the gyral crown as were used by the neuropathologist in the quantitative neuropathology. The data from the initial MR:pathology correlation were used to determine which MR slices within the middle temporal gyrus in each subject corresponded to ROI2. Each subject's MR volume data were registered to the advanced MR image data in the native subject space using SPM99 and the default registration option. Because of the different qualities of the T2 maps and MTR image data, different registration was performed and different templates used that more closely resembled the two data sets.

This region had an abnormal average T2 value in one other patient (patient 1) but MT values were within the normal range for all subjects. Clustering analysis of the histopathological data could not separate the two patients with abnormal T2 values from those subjects with normal T2 values in ROI1.

Discussion
Eriksson et al., 2005
). We have now shown that, with additional registration protocols, quantitative parameters from MRI and histopathology can be directly compared. There was a negative correlation between the histopathological field fraction measure of NeuN immunopositivity and the MR measure of T2 relaxation time in the gray matter of the middle temporal gyrus. This is the first correlation between a quantitative MR parameter and histopathological data from neocortex in patients with epilepsy.
We wished to compare the same area in all patients because it is not known how much histopathological measures and MR parameters differ as a function of location within cerebral tissue. Although some of the histopathological features of interest were readily quantified with a semi-automated protocol, stereological measures require significant expert time input. In consequence, we restricted this study to two regions of interest. The first region investigated corresponded to a region of abnormal T2 signal on SPM analysis in one patient and was chosen since it was of sufficient size to provide robust histopathological data and was available in all resections. Our second region was identified in each subject's histopathological sections, the gray matter of the crown of the middle temporal gyrus overlying ROI1, giving us data in adjacent gray matter.
Eriksson et al., 2005
). The subsequent matching of specific MR or pathology regions with their respective pathology or MR regions was carried out using computational normalization and registration, both of which were entirely repeatable. This may seem a complex procedure when, for example, the middle temporal gyrus is generally readily identified on anatomical MRI. However, the advanced quantitative MR sequences are optimized for the appropriate MR parameter and not for visualization of anatomy and it can therefore be difficult to confidently identify anatomical features using these contrasts. Identifying the structure of interest in a high quality anatomical scan and then using registration and/or normalization protocols reduced the number of subjective steps (only one definition of the tissue structure was required rather than one in each MR scan) and therefore reduced computation time and increased repeatability.
Rugg-Gunn et al., 2005
Lexa et al., 1994; Brochet and Dousset, 1999
Rugg-Gunn et al., 2003
). In the present study ROI1 was defined by an abnormal T2 value in one subject. Additional analysis revealed that this region also had an abnormal T2 signal in one other subject. MTR values were normal in this region in all subjects. There were no significant linear correlations between the MR values and the histopathological values in ROI1 in our group. The two subjects with abnormal T2 values did not differ from the other seven subjects in relation to their standard or quantitative histopathological data. The T2 and MTR values were all normal in ROI2.
Van Paesschen et al., 1997; Rugg-Gunn et al., 2005
). Increased gliosis may further reduce the relative concentration of neurons in a region, although sometimes, tissue sclerosis or gliosis causes reduction in tissue volume which could paradoxically increase packing density. We did not observe any relationship between T2 value and GFAP field fraction. Thus, the correlation detected may reflect a consistent biological relationship focused on neuronal loss. However, one subject had neocortical neuronal loss observed during routine qualitative neuropathology (Case 4). This subject had the lowest value of neuronal count in the gray matter of ROI2 (the crown of the middle temporal gyrus) but also the lowest value of T2 in ROI2 which appears contrary to the correlation observed in the whole group. The reason for this is not clear. The cortical NeuN field fraction in this case was 0.11 (range 0.08–0.13).
Gray matter neuronal counts did not correlate with the field fraction estimate of NeuN. The gray matter neuronal counts are a count for each neuron observed in the region of interest expressed as a proportion of the total area assessed. The field fraction estimate of NeuN is an estimate of the area occupied by tissue immunopositive for NeuN as a proportion of the total area assessed. This tissue is predominantly neuronal cell bodies with some axons and dendrites. Thus 5 large neurons will occupy a greater area of immunopositivity than 5 small neurons. The neuronal count would be the same in each case but the field fraction would be different. This may explain the lack of correlation between the field fraction and the neuronal count. The relation of these two measures with the T2 relaxation value suggests that the T2 relaxation is dependent on more than just the number of neurons, also on their size or complexity, which may reflect their function. Further staining protocols and analyses of neuronal size are necessary to elucidate further this difference.
The lack of any other correlations between the MR and the histopathology measures could be due to a number of factors. A real correlation may exist and not have been detected, possibly because of the limited number of subjects in the study. A change of MR scanner curtailed data collection for this series and we are now recruiting more subjects imaged using a new 3 T scanner. We could also have missed a true correlation because the registration between the MR region and the pathological region was inadequate as discussed previously.
Alternatively, there may not be any other true correlations between the MRI sequences and pathological measures studied. The pathological measures characterize real physical features — for example, the actual number of neurons and the proportion of tissue affected by gliosis. However, the underlying physical significance of the MR data is not yet well characterized. We may have chosen pathological measures which do not relate to the features characterized by the MR signals. Myelin content, for example, might influence both T2 and MTR. We did not think it likely that myelin studies would be of relevance in epilepsy in the context of this paper, but additional histopathological analyses, such as LFB for myelin or myelin basic protein, may lead to further useful data in future studies.
Tables 3 and 4
 for details). Thus the MR measures and the histopathology measures may be measuring different features of the tissue and would not be expected to correlate. A hamartia, seen as a cluster of neurons in the white matter microscopically, was not detected as an abnormal MR region with either MTR or T2 using SPM. There are new histopathological techniques in development and some of these may prove a better match to the MR signal changes. MR acquisition on a 3 T scanner will produce data with better signal-to-noise qualities and improved spatial resolution and may increase the sensitivity of quantitative MR measures. Further correlations of quantitative histopathology and quantitative MRI measures may lead to derivation of MRI measures that are most sensitive to pathological changes.
Our protocol for matching MR and pathology has demonstrated how we can investigate both the histopathology directed by an MR finding and the MR data directed by a histopathological finding. We identified a biologically plausible correlation between an increased T2 relaxation time and a reduction in neuronal labeling in the cortex of the middle temporal gyrus. If newer, quantitative MRI sequences are to be adopted more widely in routine clinical practice, further research exploring their underlying biological and pathological substrates will be necessary and may ultimately lead to a reduction in the proportion of patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy whose optimal MRI is said to be “normal”.

(b) The normalized T1-weighted image was hence in the same space as ROI1 and both could be reverse normalized to subject space using the parameters derived from the original normalization (a). (c) ROI1 could then be transferred to the equivalent histopathological section using the previously determined MRI:pathology correlation.

Registration protocol for ROI2. (a) The gyral crown of the middle temporal gyrus was identified on each patient's histopathological specimen (ROI2). (b) ROI2 was then determined on the corresponding T1-weighted volume scan using Analyze AVW 5.0. (c) The T1 volume scan was then registered to the PD images (and hence also the T2 images that were acquired simultaneously) using the SPM99 default registration options (registration 1). (d) The summed segmented T1 volume MRI (used to achieve image quality similar to MTR images) was registered to the MTR images using default options in SPM99 (registration 2). (e and f) The parameters from the two registrations were used to register ROI2 from T1 volume space to each patient's individual T2 and MTR space.
