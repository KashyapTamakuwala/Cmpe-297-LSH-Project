Vibrational microscopy and imaging offer several advantages for a variety of dermatological applications, ranging from studies of isolated single cells (corneocytes) to characterization of endogenous components in intact tissue. Two applications are described to illustrate the power of these techniques for skin research. First, the feasibility of tracking structural alterations in the components of individual corneocytes is demonstrated. Two solvents, DMSO and chloroform/methanol, commonly used in dermatological research, are shown to induce large reversible alterations (α-helix to β-sheet) in the secondary structure of keratin in isolated corneocytes. Second, factor analysis of image planes acquired with confocal Raman microscopy to a depth of 70 μm in intact pigskin, demonstrates the delineation of specific skin regions. Two particular components that are difficult to identify by other means were observed in the epidermis. One small region was formed from a conformationally ordered lipid phase containing cholesterol. In addition, the presence of nucleated cells in the tissue (most likely keratinocytes) was revealed by the spectral signatures of the phosphodiester and cytosine moieties of cellular DNA.

Introduction
Technological developments in infrared and Raman microscopic imaging have permitted several new types of biomedical applications. As demonstrated elsewhere in this volume, the diagnosis of pathological states in a wide range of tissues is now feasible, and is being pursued vigorously in laboratories around the world. The vast volume of spectral data generated from imaging experiments permits sophisticated multivariate statistical analysis of data and enables the experimentalist to discern tissue regions where spectral signatures from pathological states differ from those of healthy tissue.

]. This pathological state differs from the more widely known forms of osteoporosis, which are characterized by altered hydroxyapatite levels/structure. The origin of the spectral changes in the collagen component of pathological tissue biopsies was traced to increased levels of collagen cross links and alterations in their spatial distribution. Evidently, the availability of such information facilitates the development of strategies for tracing the origin (i.e., genetic predisposition, external factors, etc.) of the pathology.

]. In this article, we provide two examples depicting the interplay of vibrational microscopic imaging with spectra/structure correlations.
The first example uses both IR and Raman microscopy to evaluate structural changes in the keratin of single cells (corneocytes) induced by treatment with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or chloroform/methanol (C/M). These solvents have been widely used in dermatology for studies of permeation enhancement and for extracting lipid from the stratum corneum (SC), respectively. The characterization of DMSO-induced structural changes in keratin will aid in the determination of DMSO permeation pathways and in the evaluation of SC barrier recovery. Assessing C/M’s effect on keratin in isolated corneocytes including the reversibility of potential structural changes, will facilitate the delineation of solvent treatment effects from that of lipid removal.
In the second example, we demonstrate that confocal Raman microscopy along with multivariate (factor) analysis provides the detection of particular skin regions (stratum corneum, epidermis, dermis) as well as endogenous sub-areas (keratinocytes, lipid inclusions) in the epidermis. The availability of spectra–structure correlations permits molecular structure information to be deduced from either the spectra or from the factor loadings.

 gas prior to treatment with DMSO or C/M.
Corneocytes were placed on substrates that were directly dipped in pure DMSO for about 1 min. Separate aliquots of harvested corneocytes were transferred to glass vials using 5 mL C/M (2:1 v/v). Non-covalently bound lipids were extracted for 68 h while stirring at room temperature in sealed vials. Corneocytes, collected by centrifugation, were further washed 3 times using fresh C/M before the final suspension was placed on the appropriate substrate. Samples were dried overnight under vacuum prior to spectroscopic measurements. No vibrational bands from residual solvent were observed in corneocyte spectra. Subsequently, corneocytes from both DMSO and C/M treatment were rehydrated on the solid substrates by exposure to 100% relative humidity overnight before a final set of spectra were acquired.

]. The test sample consisted of five layers of a polymer laminate which incorporated two chemically identical layers (out of the five), each with a thickness of 7.5 μm separated by an intermediate layer of thickness 15 μm. This provides a center-to-center distance of 22.5 μm between the identical layers. Raman intensity profiles show a baseline-resolved width for each of the chemically identical layers of approximately 12–13 μm, a half-width of the intensity profile for each peak of about 8 μm, and a peak-to-peak distance of about 25 μm, in good agreement with the known test sample physical characteristics. The actual axial spatial resolution in the skin samples cannot be directly ascertained.

It is also noted that, based on the IR Amide I and II band contours, a fair amount of helical structure remains subsequent to DMSO treatment.

C/M solutions are commonly used to extract lipids from isolated SC and intact skin samples, but solvent effects on the structure of the remaining constituents have not been detailed. The utility of vibrational spectroscopy for evaluation of keratin secondary structure after lipid removal is somewhat hampered by the native ceramide contribution to the Amide I and II band prior to solvent exposure. In SC samples it is therefore difficult to accurately access the contribution ceramides make to Amide I and II band intensities and position. In the current work, this concern is mostly overcome by acquiring spectra of isolated corneocytes in which the ceramide contribution to the Amide modes is substantially reduced.

) as widths measured for untreated cells. The close proximity of Amide I bands arising from helical and random coil structures makes it difficult to differentiate between these two forms. Considering both the Raman and IR spectral data after rehydration, it seems safe to conclude that the majority of keratin exists in a helical form with some disordered structure remaining.

]. It may be that C/M destabilizes keratin’s native secondary structure in a manner similar to DMSO, since the majority of the native structure is restored after both solvent treatments when the corneocytes are exposed to high relative humidity.
The importance of the current experiments lies in the fact, that in studies of supposedly native protein structures in the SC, C/M is often used to remove lipid components. As shown in the current work, this procedure is not innocuous, but can induce irreversible changes in protein structure in corneocytes.

a were greatly facilitated by the availability of Raman spectra of lipids and of DNA, respectively. In addition, the availability of correlations between lipid spectra and chain conformation, permitted assignment of the lipid inclusions as having arisen from ordered lipid phases. The biological relevance of this observation remains to be determined. From a pharmacological perspective, the detection of cell nuclei (most likely keratinocytes) within intact skin permits co-localization experiments to begin to be designed. For example, for classes of drugs targeted to these cells, confocal Raman measurements will permit determination of whether the putative therapeutic agent reaches its intended target.

 is of practical importance in skin research, since solvents such as DMSO or chloroform/methanol are used for permeation enhancement and lipid extraction, respectively. In each case these solvents were found to be far from innocuous. Each induced large conformational changes in the cellular keratin. This fact had been known previously from spectra of intact SC, but two aspects of the current measurements are novel. The observation of IR data from single cells provides a sharper spectral assignment of the bands. We note for example that ceramides, a major component of the SC, have strong bands arising from the amide bond located in these lipids. These modes contribute significantly to the spectra of the intact SC and overlap protein Amide I and II vibrations; however, they are much reduced in relative intensity in spectra of cells. Thus, studies of the reversibility of the solvent-induced conformational changes benefit from the reduced intensity of ceramide interference.
Finally, it is feasible to begin to examine biochemical heterogeneity at a single cellular level. Issues such as the relationship of protein structure (either native or solvent-modified) to hydration levels or to the levels of natural moisturizing factors, in single cells may be profitably probed. In addition, changes in the spectra of cells from pathological states may be examined.
