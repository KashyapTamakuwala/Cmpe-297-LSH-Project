 oocytes and HEK293 cells. In conclusion, our data support the view that the TXR/K motif plays an important role in P2X function and that phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate is capable of modulating some P2X receptor subtypes. The underlying mechanism, however, is unlikely to involve direct PKC-mediated P2X receptor phosphorylation.

, respectively. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies were ordered through the Custom Antibody Production Services of Eurogentec (Seraing, Belgium). After 3 months and a total of four immunizations, rabbits were sacrificed by complete bleeding. Peptide-specific antibodies were purified from the serum by affinity columns coupled with the peptides used for immunization. Immunoblotting showed that the antibodies recognized only the receptor against which they were raised, thus demonstrating isoform specificity of these antibodies (results not shown). The antibodies were aliquoted at 0.12–0.16 mg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 0.01% thimerosal and stored at −80°C.

After another 3 × 5 min washes with PBST, immunoreactive bands were visualized by chemiluminescence imaging using a Fujifilm LAS-3000 system (Tokyo, Japan) and the AIDA Image Analyser Software Version 4.08 (Raytest, Straubenhardt, Germany).

ATP was prepared in Mg−ORi at its final concentration and applied by gravity-fed perfusion at a flow rate of 10 ml/min to an oocyte held by the two microelectrodes in the bath chamber (volume ∼10 μl). Switching between different perfusion solutions was achieved with electromagnetic valves controlled by the CellWorks Lite 5.1 software. Electrophysiological recordings were analysed using the Origin 6.0 software (Microcal Software Inc., Northampton, MA, USA). Single exponentials were fitted to the decay phase of the macroscopic currents with a nonlinear least squares method. The time constant τ was taken as an estimate of the rate of receptor desensitization.

Overall, the results obtained by site-directed elimination of the N-terminal TXR/K motif can be plausibly reconciled with the hypothesis that the rate of P2X receptor channel desensitization is controlled by a phosphorylation-dephosphorylation mechanism, with phosphorylation at this site being associated with a decreased rate of desensitization.
