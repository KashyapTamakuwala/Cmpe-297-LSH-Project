Objective
Lifetime cumulative number of menstrual cycles is related to breast cancer risk. The aim of this study is to investigate the relation between this index and serum sex hormone levels in postmenopausal women.

Methods
Cross-sectional study including 860 naturally postmenopausal Dutch participants of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition. Lifetime cumulative number of menstrual cycles was computed using questionnaire data on ages at menarche and menopause, number of pregnancies, breastfeeding, oral contraceptive use (OC) and regularity pattern. Measurements of hormones included estrone (E1), estradiol (E2), andostrenedione, testosterone, sex-hormone binding globulin (SHBG) and dehydroepiandrostenedione sulfate (DHEAS). The relation between the lifetime cumulative number of menstrual cycles and hormone levels was assessed using analysis of covariance. Relations between reproductive characteristics and hormone levels were also studied. Adjustments for characteristics at blood collection included age, years since menopause, BMI, hormone replacement therapy use, OC use, smoking habits, alcohol intake and physical activity were done.

Results
Lifetime cumulative number of cycles was related with SHBG; participants in the lowest category had higher SHBG levels. For the separate characteristics, DHEAS and androstenedione increased significantly with increasing age at menarche, while androstenedione and testosterone decreased with increasing age at menopause. For the parity characteristics, SHBG levels increased according to the number of live births.

Conclusions
Lifetime cumulative number menstrual cycles was related only to SHBG. Therefore, free levels of estrogens or androgens may be related to this number of menstrual cycles estimate, reflecting lifetime exposure to ovarian hormones.

]; with this rationale we studied the association between the “lifetime number of menstrual cycles” and hormone levels after the menopause. The hypothesis fits in, where a common factor at hypothalamic level may affect the speed by which oocytes are being used, increasing postmenopausal gonoadothopin levels and maybe, stimulating ovarian testosterone release from the remaining theca cells, as well as non ovarian estrogens from adrenal origin.
The aim of this study was to evaluate the relation between the “lifetime cumulative number of menstrual cycles” and the reproductive characteristics that contribute to this estimate on one side, and plasma concentrations of sex hormones on the other side, in order to elucidate the mechanism by which reproductive risk factors could influence hormone-related cancers.

 = 860) because only in them we had reliable information about ovarian activity not masked by the absence of menstrual cycles due to hysterectomy. Natural menopause was defined as the complete cessation of menstrual bleeding for 12 months preceding enrollment due to natural causes (according to self-report).
17
]. Briefly, the “lifetime cumulative number of menstrual cycles” was computed from age at first menstrual period to age at menopause. Ages at menarche, at menopause and at FFTP were recorded as continuous variables. Age at regularization of cycles was computed according to the time between menarche and the establishment of regular periods (immediately after menarche, after 1, 2, 3, 5, or 10 years, after FFTP or never regular). The regularity pattern was defined categorically as 24, 26, 28, 30 and 32 day cycles, or always irregular. Information about OC use included: age at start, number of years of use and age at last use. Data about number of and age at each pregnancy, stillbirth, miscarriage and abortion, if any, were available, as well as the number of weeks of breastfeeding for each pregnancy.
22
]. Menstrual cycles due to OC use were computed as 28 days duration (see Appendix). Considering that irregular cycles are a combination of long and short menstrual periods, the number of irregular cycles was computed according to each participant’s regularity pattern; the total number of irregular years was recorded in order to make further adjustments. The number of menstrual cycles was impossible to compute in the participants who reported to be always irregular or never having regular periods, therefore we added the “irregular” category as such in the analysis (See appendix).
Bounded levels of estrogens and androgens were measured, levels of estrone (E1), estradiol (E2), androstenedione, testosterone, sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) and dehydroepiandrostenedione sulfate (DHEAS) were measured in plasma using commercially available double-antibody radioimmunoassay (RIA) kits (Diagnostic System Laboratories Inc., Webster, TX, USA). The following kits were used: E1: DSL-8700, E2: DSL-39100, androstenedione: DSL-4200, TST: DSL-4100 SHBG: DSL-6300 and DHEAS: DSL-2700. The intra-assay coefficients of variation were 5.6%, 3.9%, 4.3%, 7.7%, 3.0% and 5.2% respectively. The inter-assay coefficients of variation were 11.1%, 4.1%, 6.3%, 8.1%, 4.0% and 5.3% respectively. All hormone assays were performed by the laboratory of the Hormones and Cancer group at the International Agency for Research on Caner (IARC). Although technically SHBG is not a hormone, for reasons of convenience it will be referred as such. We calculated the free-androgen index (FAI) dividing testosterone by SHBG and multiplying by 100, the SHGB/E2 index was calculated dividing SHBG by E2.

Data analysis
Means with their standard deviation (SD) values, or frequencies of baseline characteristics were calculated. Concentrations of all hormones were logarithmically transformed to produce approximately normal distributions. To make the results easily interpretable, we transformed the mean and its 95% confidence interval (CI) back to their original scale, resulting in geometric means and 95% CIs. Geometric mean levels and 95% CIs were calculated for each hormone (SHBG, E1, E2, androstenedione, testosterone, DHEAS), SHBG/estradiol index (SHBG/E2) and free androgen index (FAI).
23
]. For analysis of the “lifetime cumulative number of menstrual cycles” and the “number of cycles before a FFTP” variables, we also adjusted for more than one year of irregular cycles (Y/N). Given that age at menopause can be determined using age at intake in combination of years since menopause; when analyzing age at menopause, the covariate years since menopause was not entered in the model.
To test the significance of the models’ linearity, median values in each category for every variable were computed accordingly. Subsequently these values were included as a continuous variable in a linear regression model to test for linear trends. Because there is no clear natural hierarchy, the “always irregular” category was not included when testing for trend for the “lifetime number of menstrual cycles” and the “number of menstrual cycles before a FFTP” variables. Additional mutual adjustments for reproductive characteristics did not show any difference in the observed trends. The Statistical Package for Social Sciences for WINDOWS, version 14.0 (Chicago, IL), was used for all statistical analysis, and all tests were two sided.

†
 Adjusted for age at intake, years since menopause, body mass index (BMI) at examination, use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) ever (Y/N), use of oral contraceptive (OC) ever (Y/N), smoking habits, total alcohol consumption (g/day as a continuous variable) and physical activity (Voorrips total score as a continuous variable). For analysis of the “lifetime cumulative number of menstrual cycles” and “number of cycles before a FFTP” variables, we also adjusted for more than one year of irregular cycles (Y/N)
 § The always irregular category was not included when testing for trend
 * Among parous participants
 ∞ Number of years since menopause was not included in the model




Discussion
The results of the present study suggest that the “lifetime cumulative number of cycles” is related to SHBG and that some reproductive characteristics are also associated to postmenopausal serum sex hormone levels. We noted significant associations after adjusting for important confounders, the “lifetime cumulative number of menstrual cycles” related inversely with levels of SHBG and positively with SHBG/E2. Age at menarche directly relates to both DHEAS and androstenedione. Number of children had a significant relation with levels of SHBG and SHBG/E2 and age at menopause was indirectly associated to androstenedione and testosterone.

]. Our findings suggest therefore, that postmenopausal free levels of estrogens or androgens may be related to the “lifetime cumulative number of menstrual cycles” reflecting lifetime exposure to ovarian hormones.

To appreciate the findings of our study, some strengths and limitations need to be mentioned. The main advantage is our large sample size, to the best of our knowledge this is the largest study assessing the relationship between reproductive risk factors and serum sex hormone levels in naturally menopausal women and the first one evaluating the relationship between sex hormones and an index that can be used as a proxy of ovarian exposure. Another advantage is that we attempted to adjust for all relevant covariates, in order to obtain fully adjusted estimates. The participants in this cross-sectional study originated from a random sample of a large cohort, and blood samples where drawn from 97.5% of the 17,357 participants, favoring the generalization of our results. Given the prospective nature of the Prospect-EPIC study, and because participants were recruited through an existing population-based breast cancer screening program, we included only disease-free participants at baseline blood collection.

]. We did not have information regarding premenopausal sex hormone concentrations in the participants of this study; it remains unknown whether some underlying hormonal profile could have influenced both, reproductive capabilities and postmenopausal sex hormone concentrations. It is also possible that premenopausal hormone levels are more related to reproductive factors than postmenopausal levels, and that is as a proxy for premenopausal levels that postmenopausal levels relate to reproductive characteristics. We should consider that the data used regarding reproductive characteristics are prone to recall errors. However, it is unlikely that recall errors are related to endogenous hormone levels themselves, if any misclassification occurred, it would have been non-differential.
In summary, in this group of naturally postmenopausal women, the “lifetime cumulative number menstrual cycles” was related only to SHBG, suggesting that free levels of estrogens or androgens may be related to this index, reflecting lifetime exposure to ovarian hormones. Our findings show that some reproductive characteristics are related to postmenopausal serum sex hormone levels, however we do not find clear evidence to explain the mechanism by which reproductive risk factors influence hormone-related cancers in naturally postmenopausal women. It seems that reproductive and menstrual characteristics do not affect postmenopausal breast cancer risk via a long-term effect on sex hormone levels. The association of reproductive risk factors and breast cancer could be a result of prolonged exposure to ovarian hormones, and not only the product of a direct, long-lasting effect of sex hormone serum concentrations. Further research is needed in order to unravel the biological mechanisms through which reproductive characteristics relate to breast cancer risk.

Appendix
This is a simple example of a woman with an age at menarche of 12 years, one miscarriage at 23, an age at FFTP of 25 and 2 children who she breastfeed 10 weeks and 7 weeks. This participant also reported to have regular periods since her menarche with cycles every 30 days, OC use during 5 years starting at age 29, and having menopause at age 51. Her number of menstrual cycles until her FFTP is 147, and the number of menstrual cycles during her lifetime is 452.8.
Number of cycles until FFTP: 25 years at FFTP—12 years at menarche = 13 years. 13 years × 52.178 weeks in one year = 678.314 weeks in 13 years—(12 weeks miscarriage at 23)—(36 weeks first pregnancy) = 630.31 weeks = 4412.198 days. 4412.198 days / 30 = 147.07 cycles (30 days duration).
Lifetime number of menstrual cycles: 51 years at menopause −12 years at menarche = 39 (−5 years OC use = 34). 34 years × 52.178 weeks in one year = 1774.071 weeks in 34 years—(12 weeks of miscarriage)—36  × 2 weeks of two pregnancies)—(17 weeks total breastfeeding)—(6  × 2 weeks absence of cycles after lactation) = 1661.071 weeks = 11627.5 days.
11627.5 days/30 = 387.58 cycles (30 days duration).
5 years of OC use × 365.25 = 1461 days in 5 years, 1826.25/28 = 65.22 cycles (28 days duration due to OC use. 387.58 + 65.22 = 452.8 menstrual cycles during lifetime.
