Background
 Many clinicians and researchers are interested in patients of a specific age (childhood, geriatrics, and so on). Searching for age-specific publications in large bibliographic databases such as Medline is problematic because of inconsistencies in indexing, overlapping age categories, and the spread of the relevant literature over many journals. To our knowledge, no empirically tested age-specific search strategies exist for Medline.

Objective
 We sought to determine the retrieval characteristics of age-specific terms in Medline for identifying studies relevant for five clinical specialties: adult medicine, geriatric medicine, pediatric medicine, neonatal medicine, and obstetrics.

Methods
 We compared age-specific search terms and phrases for the retrieval of citations in Medline with a manual hand search of the literature for 161 core health care journals. Six experienced research assistants who were trained and intensively calibrated read all issues of 161 journals for the publishing year 2000. In addition to classifying all articles for purpose and quality, study participants' ages were also recorded. Outcome measures were sensitivity, specificity, precision, and accuracy of single and combination search terms.

Results
 When maximizing sensitivity, the best sensitivity and specificity achieved with combination terms were 98% and 81.2%, respectively, for pediatric medicine, 96.4% and 55.9% for geriatric medicine, 95.3% and 83.6% for neonatal medicine, 94.9% and 64.5% for adult medicine, and 82% and 97.1% for obstetrics. When specificity was maximized, all disciplines had an expected decrease in sensitivity and an increase in precision. Highest values for optimizing best sensitivity and specificity were achieved in neonatal medicine, 92.5% and 92.6%, respectively.

Conclusion
 Selected single terms and combinations of MeSH terms and textwords can reliably retrieve age-specific studies cited in Medline.

To assist clinicians searching for studies on age-specific patient populations, we have developed and tested Medline search strategies for detecting studies for specific age categories as well as tested age-specific search terms pertinent to five age-related clinical specialties. In this paper, we report on the evaluation of the retrieval performance of age-specific search strategies in Medline compared with a manual review (the "gold standard" search) of each article in every issue of 161 journals in the year 2000.

], we were approached by neonatologists and gerontologists to develop age-specific search strategies because they expressed frustration with the inefficiency of the current system for finding content specific to their patient population. Using only the age-related MeSH terms when searching can be time-consuming because retrievals can be very large and imprecise. To our knowledge, no empirically developed age-specific search strategies have been previously reported for Medline.

Sensitivity = a/(a + c); precision = a/(a + b); specificity = d/(b + d); accuracy = (a + d)/(a +b + c + d). All articles classified during the manual review of the literature, n = (a + b + c + d).



Individual search terms with sensitivity > 25% and specificity > 75% for a given age category were incorporated into the development of search strategies that included two or more terms. All combinations of terms used the Boolean "OR." For the development of multiple-term search strategies to either optimize sensitivity or specificity, we tested all two-term search strategies with sensitivity of at least 75% and specificity at least 50%.
To construct a comprehensive set of search terms, a list of MeSH terms and textwords was initially generated, and input was sought from clinicians and librarians in the United States and Canada through interviews with known searchers, requests at meetings and conferences, and requests to the National Library of Medicine. These experts were asked which terms or phrases they used when searching for age-specific studies, as well when searching for studies in specific purpose categories. Search terms could be MeSH terms, including publication types and subheadings, or textwords specific to age in titles and abstracts of articles. Various truncations were also applied to the textwords, phrases, and MeSH terms. We compiled a list of 543 age-specific terms (Multimedia Appendix). All terms were tested in Medline using the Ovid Technologies searching system.
Table 1
. The major difference between the hand search age categories and the MeSH terms is in how they were applied. During the hand search, we classified the age of study participants in primary studies or review articles in the following way: select one age category, if possible, or up to three to represent where ≥ 50% of participants fell. This procedure is intended to more accurately represent the focus of age-category research of clinical relevance than the comprehensive indexing of all participants' ages provided by the Medline index terms (which may be more pertinent for nonclinical purposes).
Table 1
) and through discussions with clinicians from each specialty area about which definition most appropriately reflected the age of their patients in clinical practice: geriatric medicine (≥ 65 years of age), adult medicine (19 to < 65 years of age), pediatric medicine (> 1 month to < 19 years of age), neonatal medicine (birth to 1 month), and obstetrics (fetus).

Results
Tables 3 to 7 show the operating characteristics of top-performing combinations of terms with best sensitivity, best specificity, and best optimization of sensitivity and specificity while minimizing the difference between the two, for detecting studies on geriatric medicine, adult medicine, pediatric medicine, neonatal medicine, and obstetrics in Medline in 2000. Search strategies are reported using Ovid's search engine syntax for Medline (mp = multiple posting—term appears in title, abstract, or subject heading; sh = subject heading [MeSH term]; tw = textword—word or phrase appears in title or abstract; : = truncation; pt = publication type; exp = explode—a search term that automatically includes closely related MeSH terms; tu = therapeutic use as a subheading; xs = exploded subheading).
Geriatric Medicine
The single term "exp adult" yielded the best sensitivity (96.4%) with a specificity of 55.9% for retrieving articles about geriatric medicine. However, by using the next best sensitivity combination, "aged.sh. OR age:.tw.", a small sacrifice in sensitivity (1% absolute decrease) resulted in a much better specificity compared with the most sensitive term (absolute increase 14.4%) and improved precision (absolute increase 5.2%) and accuracy (absolute increase 13.3%). As expected, precision improved slightly when specificity was maximized (absolute increase 8.6%). The term that yielded the best optimization of sensitivity and specificity, "aged.sh.", resulted in 93.6% sensitivity and 82.7% specificity.

Discussion
Our study shows that selected age-specific search strategies can achieve high retrieval of studies for age-specific populations. Our age-specific search strategies performed differently among the five specialties we investigated. The highest sensitivity and specificity were achieved for pediatric medicine (98% and 81.2%, respectively) and neonatal medicine (95.3% and 83.6%, respectively). This finding may be a result of these age groups being more precisely defined and that studies tend to be narrowly focused on them. Search strategies within obstetrics yielded a higher specificity (97.1%) than sensitivity (82%), indicating that this strategy was better at filtering out nonrelevant age-specific articles than retrieving them. The best performing strategy for optimizing sensitivity and specificity was achieved within neonatal medicine (92.5% and 92.6%, respectively). In all cases, precision was low, a consequence of searching in large multi-purpose databases. Future research is focusing on potential ways to improve precision without compromising sensitivity, for example, by searching in journal subsets.
18
]. Another potential limitation of our study is that our interrater agreement for classifying age content did not reach 100%. However, exceeding the level of agreement achieved in our study (> 80% beyond chance) is rarely done in diagnostic studies. The scope of journals investigated in our journal subset could be a limitation, but we have no indication that these search strategies would perform differently in other journal subsets aside from the precision values reported. Precision is affected by the prevalence of on-target articles within the database. Thus, our precision figures are presented as estimates of search strategy performance.
The utility of age-specific filters will vary according to the needs of clinicians and researchers who must weigh the consequences of using a sensitive or specific search. Although a sensitive search will not miss many relevant articles, such searches are less precise and entail time-consuming sorting through irrelevant articles. The narrower yield of a specific search will capture many relevant articles and take less weeding, but it has greater potential for missing key articles.

Outperformed two- and three-term combinations.



However, sifting through such a large number of articles would be time-consuming and many of these articles would not be relevant to treatment studies in geriatric medicine. By combining the content term "Huntington disease" with the most sensitive combination of terms for treatment studies (clinical trial.mp. OR clinical trial.pt. OR random:.mp. OR tu.xs.), the search can be narrowed to 901 articles. Further, by adding the most sensitive strategy for geriatric medicine (exp adult) to this search string with the Boolean operator AND, the search is refined to 483 articles, which is much more manageable than the original 5907 articles retrieved from searching the content term only. A sensitive search such as this would be an efficient beginning for researchers interested in conducting systematic reviews.

Conclusion
Selected age-specific search strategies can enhance the retrieval of studies for clinicians and researchers who need information relevant for a well-defined age-category patient population. The optimal trade-off between sensitivity and specificity should be determined according to the needs of the searcher.
