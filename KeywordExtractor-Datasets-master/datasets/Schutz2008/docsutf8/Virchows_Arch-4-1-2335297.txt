 = 1) invasive cancer. The high slide rating might explain the high percentages of epithelial atypia and concomitant cancers and the low percentage of subsequent cancer after a diagnosis of epithelial atypia as a single lesion. Epithelial atypia could be more a risk marker of concomitant than subsequent cancer.

] and with the development of percutaneous large core needle biopsy (CNB) methods using stereotactic mammography or ultrasound guidance. At present, CNB is frequently used for the initial evaluation of clinically occult breast lesions, thus generating dilemma for the subsequent management of certain noncancerous lesions. At our institution, surgical biopsies (SB) have always been managed in the same way, and most patients with atypical and malignant lesions have been followed. The objectives of our work were to analyze the occurrence of epithelial atypia and their association with a concomitant cancer in a large series of SB performed for microcalcifications without a palpable tumor and to assess the subsequent cancer probability in the group of patients with an initial diagnosis of epithelial atypia. Finally, we provide some practical considerations for the management of patients with epithelial atypia in this era of mammographic screening and CNB.

Materials and methods
Selection of patients

]. SB for diagnostic purposes were defined before 1998 by the absence of a preoperative diagnosis based on the clinical–mammographic–cytologic triplet and by the absence of a positive frozen section and, since 1998, by the presence of epithelial atypia on CNB. Excluded from this study were 132 cancers and 139 non-atypical benign lesions diagnosed on CNB as well as 49 re-excisions performed elsewhere than in our center. Thus, 2,833 SB in 2,375 patients were available for analysis, among which 13 corresponded to re-excision after a CNB with epithelial atypia. Since 1989, needle localization, intraoperative specimen radiography, and post-excisional biopsy mammography have been performed in most cases.

Surgical biopsies and tissue sampling: serial macroscopic sectioning
12
]. In most cases (89%), careful macroscopic examination of the specimen failed to reveal any lesion. Each numbered slice was put in as many numbered separate cassettes as necessary and paraffin-embedded in sequence. The median number of blocks per SB was 26 (from 2 to 180) and 8 (from 1 to 44) for surgical margins. Each block was examined on one hematoxylin–eosin–safran stained slide.

Atypical ductal hyperplasia: definition and sizing
Among the group of ADH/DIN 1B, we individualized two morphologic types of ADH. Neither had any high-grade cytological atypia or necrosis.

]. Presence and topography of microcalcifications were also assessed. Lastly, when FEA and/or “mimicking” DCIS foci were found on excision margins of a SB with DCIS, a further surgical resection was not performed.

Follow-up of patients with epithelial atypia as a single lesion
There were 443 patients with epithelial atypia in one or several SB, without any previous or synchronous carcinoma in the same or contralateral breast and treated by biopsy alone (median follow-up 160 months, 7 to 315). Only 28/443 (6%) were lost to follow-up. Among the 415 other patients, 180 were monitored at our institute and 235 outside by correspondent specialists working in close relationship with our institute. All patients received a clinical examination and mammography once a year. When a new biopsy was necessary, it was performed at our institute.

Statistical analyses
Comparison of clinical and histologic characteristics was conducted by using the chi-square test. For women with epithelial atypia, the probability of developing in situ or invasive cancer was calculated from the date of the first biopsy to the earliest event: breast cancer (ipsi- or contralateral), death, or last contact (last consultation for the group monitored at our institute and checkpoint date, i.e., 1 March 2004, for the others). Probabilities were calculated according to the Kaplan–Meier method (SPSSv11).


Results
Occurrence of epithelial atypia in the 2,833 surgical biopsies
Epithelial atypia were recorded in 971/2,833 SB (34%). They were found with and without a concomitant cancer in 301/971 (31%) and 670/971 (69%) of the cases, respectively. Thus, isolated epithelial atypia were found in 23% of the cases (670 out of the 2,833 SB). Calcifications were present at histologic examination in 98.6% of SB with cancer and were located in benign, cancerous, and both lesions in 10, 39, and 51% of the cases, respectively. In several cases, cancerous foci without any microcalcifications were located at points distant from those with calcifications detected by needle localization.

Types of epithelial atypia
Among the 971 SB with epithelial atypia, there were 101 SB with FEA as a single lesion (11%), 342 (35%) with ADH, 223 (23%) with LN, and 305 (31%) with ADH and LN. Thus, ADH was encountered in 647/971 SB (66%).
