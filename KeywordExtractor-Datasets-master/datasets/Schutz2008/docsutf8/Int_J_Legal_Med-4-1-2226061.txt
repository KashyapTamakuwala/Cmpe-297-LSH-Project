Human body fluids such as blood and saliva represent the most common source of biological material found at a crime scene. Reliable tissue identification in forensic science can reveal significant insights into crime scene reconstruction and can thus contribute toward solving crimes. Limitations of existing presumptive tests for body fluid identification in forensics, which are usually based on chemoluminescence or protein analysis, are expected to be overcome by RNA-based methods, provided that stable RNA markers with tissue-specific expression patterns are available. To generate sets of stable RNA markers for reliable identification of blood and saliva stains we (1) performed whole-genome gene expression analyses on a series of time-wise degraded blood and saliva stain samples using the Affymetrix U133 plus2 GeneChip, (2) consulted expression databases to obtain additional information on tissue specificity, and (3) confirmed expression patterns of the most promising candidate genes by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction including additional forensically relevant tissues such as semen and vaginal secretion. Overall, we identified nine stable mRNA markers for blood and five stable mRNA markers for saliva detection showing tissue-specific expression signals in stains aged up to 180 days of age, expectedly older. Although, all of the markers were able to differentiate blood/saliva from semen samples, none of them could differentiate vaginal secretion because of the complex nature of vaginal secretion and the biological similarity of buccal and vaginal mucosa. We propose the use of these 14 stable mRNA markers for identification of blood and saliva stains in future forensic practice.

], which covers about 100 human tissues, and finally verified by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in blood and saliva as well as in other body fluids relevant for forensic casework, i.e., semen and vaginal secretion.

Materials and methods
Sample collection
Aliquots of 5 ml of whole blood and saliva were collected from each of five healthy volunteers (four men and one woman) of western European genetic origin under informed consent before their inclusion in the study. Native blood was collected without anticoagulation treatment to avoid disturbing effects of anticoagulation reagents on gene expression. In each sample, 75 cotton swabs were immersed. Special care was taken to shorten the time between collection and swab absorption to avoid blood coagulation. After complete absorption of the fluids, swabs were left until dry on a bench top at room temperature. When dry, the swabs were stored in dust-free nonhumid conditions (but subjected to normal daylight) for different time intervals. Swabs were visually inspected and sorted out to ensure similar liquid content between individual swabs. After 0, 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, 57, and 180 days, swabs were stored at −80°C until RNA isolation. For the time interval 0 days, samples were frozen immediately after drying. Semen and vaginal secretion samples were collected from one male and one female individual absorbed with cotton swabs and dried overnight before RNA isolation.

RNA isolation
RNA was isolated using the Qiagen RNeasy kit (Qiagen Benelux B.V.) according to the manufacturer’s instructions with minor modifications. These included cutting up the cotton swab into 1 × 1-mm pieces and soaking them in RLT buffer for 1 h at 4°C before the extraction. Trial experiments to lengthen this incubation time up to 24 h did not reveal any improvement in respect to RNA quantity and quality (data not shown).

]. In the saliva dataset, we selected only genes with signal intensities above 50 (which is below the usually applied background threshold in expression array experiments) that had a signal intensity below 50 in the blood dataset. The selection of blood-targeted genes was done in a similar manner but with different criteria, the lower intensity limit in blood was set to 1,000 to reasonably restrict the number of candidates.

) method. In both cases, GAPDH gene was used as an endogenous control to normalize the amplification signal between the samples from different tissues and individuals. Time points were compared to each other without normalization: Assuming the temporal degradation of all RNA molecules, no internal control gene could be used, and the only proper way to normalize RT-PCR signals was to use the same amount of template in each reaction. We found that this requirement holds true for our experiments because the GAPDH expression variability between different samples from the same tissue was relatively low (CV <25%, data not shown), which is probably because of approximately the same amount of blood or saliva absorbed with cotton swabs during material collection.

However, five genes demonstrated only slightly differential or even comparable expression in blood and semen (CD36, CCR1, PF4, BIN2, and ALOX5), not expected given the information provided by the GNF database, and were therefore excluded from the final list of blood-specific markers. Thus, our microarray-based genome-wide approach to find tissue-specific mRNA markers identified the genes that are functionally relevant for the target tissues.

Conclusions

In summary, whole-genome expression analysis in time-wise degraded samples from blood and saliva stains in combination with RT-PCR verification of various forensically relevant body fluids has resulted in the identification of stable tissue-specific mRNA markers from five genes for saliva (SPRR3, SPRR1A, KRT4, KRT6A, and KRT13) and nine genes for whole blood (CASP1, AMICA1, C1QR1, ALOX5AP, AQP9, C5R1, NCF2, MNDA, and ARHGAP26). For the first time, mRNA markers were ascertained considering almost the entire human transcriptome and based on experimental data of genome-wide gene expression as well as considering the degradation stability of mRNAs. We could demonstrate that the candidate genes identified here provide informative mRNA markers for blood and saliva identification for stains up to 180 days of age. We would like to propose their application in forensic case work (with the potential practical limitation of coamplification in vaginal secret) for stains of at least 6 months of age. However, we expect that the proposed mRNA markers will successfully identify older blood and saliva stains (respective experiments are currently in progress). Finally, we would like to remark that tissue identification in forensics should be performed in a reciprocal way; so that a tissue is identified because of the presence of markers specific for the relevant tissue together with the absence of markers specific for all other tissues in question. Clearly, more research should be dedicated towards finding the most suitable markers for tissue identification in forensics.
