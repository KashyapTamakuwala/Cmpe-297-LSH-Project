The aim of our study was to assess the prevalence of variants and anomalies of the coronary artery tree in patients who underwent 64-slice computed tomography coronary angiography (CT-CA) for suspected or known coronary artery disease. A total of 543 patients (389 male, mean age 60.5 ± 10.9) were reviewed for coronary artery variants and anomalies including post-processing tools. The majority of segments were identified according to the American Heart Association scheme. The coronary dominance pattern results were: right, 86.6%; left, 9.2%; balanced, 4.2%. The left main coronary artery had a mean length of 112 ± 55 mm. The intermediate branch was present in the 21.9%. A variable number of diagonals (one, 25%; two, 49.7%; more than two, 24%; none, 1.3%) and marginals (one, 35.2%; two, 46.2%; more than two, 18%; none, 0.6%) was visualized. Furthermore, CT-CA may visualize smaller branches such as the conus branch artery (98%), the sinus node artery (91.6%), and the septal branches (93%). Single or associated coronary anomalies occurred in 18.4% of the patients, with the following distribution: 43 anomalies of origin and course, 68 intrinsic anomalies (59 myocardial bridging, nine aneurisms), three fistulas. In conclusion, 64-slice CT-CA provides optimal visualization of the variable and complex anatomy of coronary arteries because of the improved isotropic spatial resolution and flexible post-processing tool.

CT scan and reconstruction parameters
All examinations were performed with a 64-slice CT scanner (Sensation 64, Siemens, Forcheim, Germany) with the following parameters: slices/collimation 32/0.6 mm, rotation time 330 ms, effective temporal resolution (with 180° algorithm) 165 ms, 120 kv, 900 mAs, table feed/s 11.63 mm, effective slice thickness 0.6 mm, reconstruction increment 0.3 mm, field of view (FOV) 140–180 mm, isotropic voxel resolution of 0.4 × 0.4 × 0.4 mm.
Patients with heart rate >70 bpm received 100 mg of metoprolol per os 1 h prior the examination. A bolus of 100 ml of high iodinated contrast material (400 mg/ml iomeprol, Iomeron 400, Bracco, Milan, Italy) was injected into an antecubital vein of the right arm with a flow rate of 5 ml/s, followed by a 40-ml saline chaser. A bolus-tracking technique was used for the synchronization between arterial passage of contrast material and MSCT-CA.
Data were reconstructed by retrospective gating in end-diastolic phase (from -300 to -450 ms before the peak of the subsequent R wave) or end-sistolic phase to better image the right coronary artery (RCA).

Image and data analysis

], who loaded the datasets off-line into a dedicated workstation (Leonardo, Siemens, Germany). A total number of 559 examinations were performed and only 13 scans were considered not assessable by the readers in consensus due to poor image quality (severe breathing, triggering or motion artefacts).
All data were analysed with post-processing tools such as multiplanar reconstructions (MPR), curved MPR (cMPR), maximum intensity projections (MIP), and volume rendering (VR) to three-dimensionally image the complex anatomy of the coronary artery tree. Disagreement was solved by a consensus reading. Segments were classified according to the American Heart Association (AHA) scheme. Variants considered were: the coronary dominance (right, left, balanced), the variable origin of the conus branch and sinus node artery, the left main (LM) length, the presence of the intermediate branch, the number of diagonal and marginal branches. Anomalies of origin and course, intrinsic coronary anomalies (myocardial bridging, aneurisms >1.5 mm) and termination anomalies (fistulas) were checked. Prevalence data of single coronary artery variants and anomalies were collected.

Furthermore, the septal branches of the left anterior descending artery (LAD) were detected in the 93% (505/543). The opportunity of reporting septal branches of LAD must be taken into account because of the hemodinamic relevance of these vessels.

]. Eighty-five patients with not significant CAD presented 14 coronary anomalies (16.5%). Four hundred and fifty-eight patients with significant CAD (with >50% stenosis, during stent or by-pass follow-up) presented 86 coronary anomalies (18.8%). Therefore, the prevalence was similar in the two groups. However, a bias is given by the fact that 67 patients were addressed to 64-slice CT-CA after CCA to determine the three-dimensional imaging of a suspected anomaly. After excluding these 67 patients, the prevalence of coronary anomalies was higher in the CAD patients (11.4% vs 4.2%). The prevalence of myocardial bridging resulted higher in the CAD group (7.4% vs 2.8%).

Compared with 16-slice CT-CA, 64-slice CT-CA provides improved temporal resolution and isotropic spatial resolution which allow optimal three-dimensional visualization of the variable and complex anatomy of coronary arteries. Sixty-four-slice CT-CA may non-invasively define normal anatomical variants from potentially dangerous anomalies and support the clinical management of referring cardiologists and cardiac surgeons.
