	   Genes with unknown function are called orphan genes while their transcripts and peptides are called hypothetical proteins. There are many genes and their 
	   associated proteins that remain uncharacterized in the human genome. A database of human hypothetical proteins with ascribed functions could be helpful 
	   for biologists to search for potential proteins of interest. In recent years, the rapid completion of genome sequences has created essential information 
	   to link genes to gene products. In order to better explain functions for un-annotated proteins we designed BioinformaTRICKS (an open source project) and 
	   used it to develop a database called HYPO.

Background

]
The annotation of various human chromosomes is well supported by computational predictions where there is no similarity to known proteins or EST sequences. The genes that 
have unknown function called as orphan genes code for proteins annotated as “hypothetical proteins”. Hence, there is a need to begin constructing and analyzing protein families 
clustered as “hypothetical proteins” with an aim to elucidate function and protein subunit interactions.

However, there is no adequate information to necessitate function of genes that cannot be based on homology alone, except connected to other known gene family.

could perhaps throw light on the plausible function of the hypothetical proteins through the bona fide interactions they are involved with.

]. Information on “known” or “unknown” protein-protein interactions is 
still mostly limited but integrating tools such as these could generalize a way to find the function of hypothetical proteins. 
While we started mining the proteins, it seemed that there are a few hypothetical proteins that have amino acid residues HYP (histidine, tyrosine and proline) in succession. 
These might have been long-established through the mutations that are introduced into the proteins at one or more predicted non-essential residues.

] A “conservative 
amino acid substitution” is the one in which the amino acid residue is replaced with an amino acid residue having a similar side chain. The families of amino acid residues having 
similar side chains are distinct and include conserved amino acids such as histidine (aromatic/basic side chains), tyrosine (polar side chain) and proline (non polar side chains). 
On the other hand, these might have appeared during annotation through the mutations introduced randomly along all or part of a coding sequence. Our database has over 6362 hypothetical 
proteins that could be searched for different functions.

Observations and challenges
We observe in tandem that few hypothetical proteins present on different chromosomal loci are known to have the same putative function. Categorizing several approaches beyond 
traditional sequence similarity that utilize tremendously large amounts of data that is available for computational prediction of functions is the need of the hour these days. 
Having said this, one could use a subset of proteins that match from several of the experimental approaches and be used as a predictor to circumvent the use of wet laboratory 
experiments in the near future.

] With 
Protein Data Bank (PDB), not accepting theoretical structures, there is an emphasis for experimental approach by researchers to determine the structure and functional relationship 
of a protein. Nevertheless, carefully considering the functional annotation methods as discussed above could definitely devise selection for proteins that could be experimented. 
This could be an interesting approach to pursue further.
Yet another issue to be noted is the appraisal to understand if any of the hypothetical proteins have proper functional annotations’ been attributed to sequence: structure: 
function relationship in case of ordered proteins while sequence: un-structure: function in case of intrinsically disordered proteins. In conclusion, the current methods could 
play an important role in establishing functions for proteins annotated as hypothetical in the genome.

Note
The title of the article contains hypo abbreviated for hypothetical proteins.
