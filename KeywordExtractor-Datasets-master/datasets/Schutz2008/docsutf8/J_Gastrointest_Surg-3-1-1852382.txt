Tetanus after hemorrhoidal banding is an extremely rare but serious complication of the procedure. We describe the second reported case of this complication and review the literature concerning tetanus after different gastrointestinal procedures. Although a rare complication, practicing physicians need to be aware of the clinical presentation of this deadly disease when encountered in at-risk patient populations. Such cases also reemphasize the importance of primary tetanus immunization and follow-up boosters for all vulnerable patients.

Introduction

 In developed countries, tetanus is most commonly seen in immigrant patients who have never received a complete primary immunization series. Another at-risk group is the elderly people who have not received recent booster doses. Such cases in the older, previously vaccinated adult reflects waning immunity if a booster shot is not received every 10 years.
Closteridium tetani
C. tetani
 is a spore-forming bacteria that once inside the body of susceptible host, produces a potent toxin named tetanospasmin. Tetanospasmin binds to the central nervous system causing diffuse muscle spasms and autonomic instability that characterizes tetanus. Tetanus is usually seen in association with soil contamination of a cutaneous wound; however, on rare occasions it may occur after a surgical procedure such as gastrointestinal surgery. In this paper, we describe the second reported case of tetanus after banding ligation of internal hemorrhoids and will review the other reported cases of tetanus after gastrointestinal procedures.

Case Report
Acinetobacter baumanii
. Attempts to wean her during endotracheal intubation were unsuccessful and the patient required a tracheostomy. After about 2 months of hospitalization, she gradually improved and was weaned from the respirator. She had upper and lower muscle atrophy, global muscle weakness, and ankle contractures bilaterally. She had no obvious sensory, cognitive, or language deficits. She was able to roll herself in bed and feed herself; however, she was unable to stand, walk, or place herself on bedpan. She was subsequently transferred to an inpatient rehabilitation facility for intensive physical and occupational therapy. At the completion of a month-long inpatient rehabilitation program, she showed some improvement but still had some lower extremity weakness (grade 3–4 out of 5 of muscle strength bilaterally) and residual ankle contractures; she could walk with assistance using a forearm crutch. The patient was discharged from the hospital with a continuing outpatient rehabilitation program.

 Furthermore, despite its rarity, practitioners need to be aware of the clinical presentation of tetanus and consider the diagnosis in at-risk patients who present with characteristic symptoms such as trismus and muscle rigidity.

Conclusion
Postoperative cases of tetanus have been reported after a number of different gastrointestinal procedures. Tetanus can occur after relatively minor procedures such as hemorrhoidal banding. Practicing physicians need to be aware of the clinical presentation of this deadly disease when encountered in vulnerable patient populations.
