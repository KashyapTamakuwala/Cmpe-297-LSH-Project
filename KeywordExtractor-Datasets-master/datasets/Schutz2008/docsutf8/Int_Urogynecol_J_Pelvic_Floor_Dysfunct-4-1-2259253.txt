The clinical impact of incontinence in pregnancy and after childbirth is growing because some studies report the efficacy of physiotherapy in pregnancy and because obstetric choices are supposed to have significant impact on post-reproductive urinary function (Goldberg et al. in Am J Obstet Gynecol 188:1447–1450, 2003). Thus, the need for objective measurement of urinary incontinence in pregnancy is growing. Data on pad testing in pregnancy are lacking. We assessed the clinical relevance of the 24-h pad test during pregnancy and after childbirth, compared with data on self-reported symptoms of urinary incontinence and visual analogue score. According to the receiver operating characteristic curve, the diagnostic value of pad testing for measuring (severity of) self-reported incontinence during pregnancy is not of clinical relevance. However, for the purposes of research, pad tests, combined with subjective/qualitative considerations, play a critical role in allowing comparisons across studies, quantifying the amount of urine loss and establishing a measure of severity.

]. The 24-h pad testing has been studied and described exclusively in non-pregnant women. In this study, we focussed on the diagnostic strength of pad testing to measure (the severity of) urinary incontinence in pregnancy and after childbirth. The aims of this study were (1) to describe pad weight gain as measured by the 24-h pad test in a cohort of pregnant women and (2) to assess the clinical usefulness of the 24-h pad test in pregnancy and after childbirth in terms of the relationship between objective urine loss and the self-reported symptoms of urinary incontinence.

Materials and methods
One hundred and seventeen women who attended the outpatient clinics of the University Hospital Groningen and the Martini Hospital Groningen enrolled for the study, with a mean age of 30 years (range 17–41). All women were of Caucasian origin, except three who were of Mediterranean origin. All women were nulliparous and had no history of incontinence, pelvic operations or neurological disease. Written informed consent was obtained from all participating women. The study was approved by the medical ethical committees of both hospitals. For this study, the women were investigated at 28–32 and at 36–38 weeks of pregnancy and 6 weeks and 6 months post-partum.

Statistical analysis
Pad test results have a non-parametric distribution. For continuous variables, non-parametric tests are used. Numeric data are analysed by cross tabulation, chi-squared test and risk analysis. Pearson correlation test was used to identify significant relationships between variables. Data are presented as median or numbers.

]. Because of pregnancy and because we are interested in an instrument for screening, it is obvious that urodynamic testing cannot be the instrument of choice. Pad testing is an objective, simple and non-invasive instrument capable of measuring fluid loss in a certain period. First of all, we need to define normal values, data that describe the results of pad testing in a cohort of pregnant women without a history of incontinence before pregnancy. Secondly, we need comparison with the criterion standard in pregnancy and the patients’ history.

]. When compared to the pre-menopausal women, the state of pregnancy does not lead to a higher weight gain in the 24-h pad test nor does the puerperal state.
It is remarkable that the group of controls as referred to had similar pad test results but did not report incontinence, whereas in our pregnant group, 30 (28 weeks of pregnancy) and 35% (38 weeks of pregnancy) of the women did. With the same weight gain in pregnancy, women report more incontinence than in the sample of non-pregnant women. It seems therefore that not the amount of weight gain in the pad test but the pregnancy state itself is more discriminating for the chance that a woman qualifies herself as incontinent.
21
] stated that “incontinence is a complex condition in which differences in the individual patients’ personal characteristics influence the perception of leakage and the identification of the problem. Pregnancy seems to modulate this perception in such a way that it cannot be measured by pad test. As pad testing did not show to have high sensitivity and specificity for self-reported urinary incontinence in pregnancy and after childbirth, there remains confusion about the accurate diagnosis. This becomes important in deciding on management options such as offering preventive physiotherapy in selected cases or strategies that influence the mode of delivery.
22
] reported a discrepancy between self-reported symptoms and stress urinary incontinence assessed by their (short) pad test, 8 weeks after delivery. To assign a women to an intervention, one needs a higher specificity, which according to the curves as shown, will rapidly lead to lower sensitivity. Depending on the chosen intervention, this may or may not be accepted.
The calculation of the diagnostic strength of our 24-h pad test was made with the self-reporting of symptoms of urinary incontinence as the gold standard. At 28 weeks, the pad test failed to capture eight subjects who stated they were wet; at 38 weeks, this was higher. Such results are possibly related to the high threshold for definition of incontinence in the women with some leaking less than 9 g describing some leakage. The rationale for using a high cutoff is established in both men and women, but subjects themselves may perceive this a severe incontinence. It is possible that pregnant and post-delivery women perceive leakage differently than their non-pregnant counterparts.
When adding severity of symptoms to the gold standard, as reported by VAS, the diagnostic strength of the pad test did not improve.
23
] concludes that measuring symptom severity and quality of life changes in women with pelvic floor disorders is an important part of the evaluation and treatment of women and may be the only practical way to clinically assess symptoms. However, for the purposes of research, pad tests, combined with subjective/qualitative considerations, play a critical role in allowing comparisons across studies, quantifying the amount of urine loss and establishing a measure of severity. Indeed, the International Continence Society standards for research strongly recommend the pad test as one measure in all incontinence research. The fact that the pad test results and patient-reported incontinence were not strongly correlated illustrates the importance of both quantitative and qualitative measures when considered an intervention trial with pelvic floor muscle exercises, for example.
From our study, we conclude that pad testing measures fluid loss over a certain period but does not quantify self-reported symptoms of urinary incontinence. Both measurements are of interest but cannot replace each other. Stressing of the pelvic floor by pregnancy and childbirth modulates the sensation of urinary leakage in such a way that women in this state do report symptoms of urinary incontinence more frequently than nulliparous pre-menopausal women do.
