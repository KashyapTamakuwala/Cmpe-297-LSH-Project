 using FuGene 6 according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were fixed in ice-cold methanol 24 h after transfection then stained according to standard protocols. In brief, cells were incubated with goat anti-Notch-1 antibody (1:100), mouse monoclonal anti-promyelocytic leukaemia protein antibody (1:100) or mouse monoclonal anti-splicing factor SC-35 antibody (1:250) before being incubated with the appropriate fluorescent secondary antibody (1:200). Nuclei were stained with Hoescht 33342. Immunofluorescence was visualized and captured using a Zeiss LSM510 meta confocal microscope. Images were processed using LSM5 image examiner software (Zeiss). All experiments were performed in triplicate. Figures shown are representative images from a single experiment.

 using FuGene 6 according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche, UK). To control for transfection efficiency 50 ng of phTK-Renilla luciferase (Promega, UK) was also included in transfections. Empty vector DNA was included where necessary to maintain constant DNA concentrations. Twenty-four hours post-transfection the cells were lysed and firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were sequentially measured using Dual-Glo reagents (Promega) in a Wallac Trilux 1450 Luminometer (Perkin-Elmer, UK). Values were normalized by dividing firefly values by the Renilla value from the same well. Data for each set of four replica transfections was averaged, the control in each set normalized to 1 and data presented as fold increases over control. All experiments were performed in triplicate.

-positive bodies form part of a physiologically relevant, multimeric, protein complex involved in gene transcription. Moreover, the presence of such sub-nuclear bodies provides evidence that the nucleus contains defined domains and is not merely a homogenous pool of nucleic acids and proteins.
