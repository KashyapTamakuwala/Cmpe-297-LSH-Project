Custom-made mandibular advancement devices are an effective treatment option for snoring, upper airway resistance syndrome, and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Evidence-based data indicates their efficacy, and international sleep societies recommend oral appliance (OA) therapy for patients with sleep-related breathing disorders. The following position paper by the German Society of Dental Sleep Medicine (DGZS) is to guide the interdisciplinary team (sleep physician and sleep disorder dentist) in detail when to prescribe oral appliances. This position paper supports the responsible use of OA as an effective treatment option for patients with sleep-related breathing disorders. The paper advises of proper indication regarding OSA severity, body mass index (BMI), and dentition. It emphasizes the interdisciplinary approach of oral appliance therapy and suggests treatment under the guidance of dentists trained in dental sleep medicine.

]. Of the many oral appliances designed for use in the treatment of SRBD, mandibular advancement devices have been the most intensely researched. Progress in the areas of dentistry and appliance technology has lead to fundamental modifications in the design of mandibular advancement devices.

The definition of mandibular advancement devices in the treatment of SRBD
A system of laboratory fabricated custom-made adjustable splints manufactured for the individual patient and adjusted to fit the upper and lower jaws. These splints position the lower jaw, tongue, and additional structures more anteriorly, and increase the occlusal vertical dimension, resulting in an opening of the pharynx lumen, which reduces resistance in the airway and mechanically keeps the airway open during sleep.

In cases of SRBD with an approximate AHI of over 25/h, MADs can be used as an alternative after a previous therapeutic trial with nCPAP.

Regardless of SRBD severity in patients with CPAP failure and CPAP noncompliance.

A special dental, oral, and functional diagnosis is necessary to check the dental requirements for long-term use before prescribing MADs.

The procedure should take into account the various interdisciplinary and intradisciplinary treatment flows, particularly the preliminary medical diagnosis and the subsequent medical follow-ups.

This service should be delivered by dentists who have specialized training in the field of sleep medicine.
