Due to the heterogeneity in genetic and environmental interactions, most of the genes and pathways for schizophrenia and for other complex disorders are still unknown.

All rats were bred and reared in the Central Animal Facility of the Radboud University Nijmegen under approved animal protocols and in accordance with institutional guidelines.

Reactions were carried out in a thermal cycler (Perkin-Elmer) with five cycles of low stringency (94°C for 30 s, 40°C for 60 s, 72°C for 1.5 min), followed by 30 cycles of high stringency (94°C for 15 s, 55°C for 15 s, 72°C for 1 min). Two microliters of the PCR products were analysed on high-resolution 5% polyacrylamide gels under denaturing conditions (7 M urea) for 4–4.5 h at 70 W. Gels were dried and radiolabelled DNA was visualized by autoradiography at −70°C (CEA AB, Sweden).

The product indicated by the arrow is an example of a product that did not show variable amounts and was used for normalisation of the E1-product. The amounts of the E1-products generated from the cerebellum or hippocampus were not different between the two Wistar rats with low gnawing scores (<10 gnaws in 45 min) and the two Wistar rats with high gnawing scores (>500 gnaws in 45 min)

 locus might not be solely responsible for the observed phenotypes of the two rat lines and suggesting a multi-genetic and -epigenetic origin of the differences observed between the APO-SUS and -UNSUS rats. Importantly, we found similar AP-PCR patterns in both the original and replicate APO-SUS and -UNSUS lines. It is therefore highly unlikely that the observed variations between the APO-SUS and -UNSUS rat genomes were simply due to coincidence.

 locus. The two newly identified, topoisomerase II-based genetic variations might point to a more general role for topoisomerase II binding sites in psychopathological mechanisms. We hypothesize that at these sites environmental factors, such as stress during early development, may cause an increase in the incidence of recombination and other mutagenic events, leading to brain dysfunction and affected behavior. Besides the genetic differences, one tissue-specific epigenetic variation was found between the APO-SUS and -UNSUS epigenomes. At present it is not clear what, if any, functional consequence should be attributed to the decrease in the methylation status of this CpG in the (hypo)thalamus and cerebellum, but not in the hippocampus, of APO-SUS relative to APO-UNSUS rats.

). Hence, as part of the genetic and epigenetic background of the APO-SUS and -UNSUS rat lines, our newly identified variants can be genetic and epigenetic modifiers influencing the phenotypic expression of the model. Insight into the genetic and epigenetic background may provide diagnostic tools, and clues for mechanisms and pathways to explain complex disorders.

 gene, probably in combination with other genetic or epigenetic factors, could then have led to the complex phenotype observed in the APO-SUS rats.
In conclusion, the present findings suggest that psychopathological disturbances may be the result of multiple genetic as well as epigenetic factors. We infer that our newly identified variations are susceptibility loci for schizophrenia-like features in the rat and may give new insights into the genetic and epigenetic background of complex neurodevelopmental disorders.
