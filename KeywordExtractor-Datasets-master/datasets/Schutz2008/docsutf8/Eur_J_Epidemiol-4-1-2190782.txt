Aims To compare short- and long-term mortality after a first acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in patients with and without diabetes mellitus. Methods and results A nationwide cohort of 2,018 diabetic and 19,547 nondiabetic patients with a first hospitalized AMI in 1995 was identified through linkage of the national hospital discharge register and the population register. Follow-up for mortality lasted until the end of 2000. At 28 days and 5 years respectively, absolute mortality risks were 18 and 53% in diabetic men, 12 and 31% in nondiabetic men, 22 and 58% in diabetic women, and 19 and 42% in nondiabetic women. Crude mortality was significantly higher in diabetic patients than in nondiabetic patients in both men (28-day hazard ratio (HR) 1.55; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.32–1.81, 5-year HR 2.01; 95% CI 1.84–2.21) and women (28-day HR 1.19; 95% CI 1.03–1.37, 5-year HR 1.53; 95% CI 1.40–1.67). After multivariate adjustment, risk differences became nonsignificant at 28 days, but diabetes was still associated with a significantly higher long-term mortality in both men (28-day HR 1.16; 95% CI 0.99–1.36, 5-year HR 1.49; 95% CI 1.36–1.64) and women (28-day HR 1.12; 95% CI 0.97–1.28, 5-year HR 1.39; 95% CI 1.27–1.52). The interaction between diabetes mellitus and gender did not reach significance in the analyses. Conclusion Our findings in an unselected cohort covering a complete nation show a significantly higher long-term mortality after a first acute myocardial infarction in diabetic patients. Yet, short-term mortality is not significantly higher in diabetic patients. Risks appear to be equally elevated in men and women.

] code 250 and subcategories, principal and secondary diagnoses) was registered during previous hospital admissions in 1991–1995 and in case of DM also during the index admission in 1995. Data on mortality of the patients were derived by linking their records with the population register and the cause of death certificates. In the population register, it is recorded when a registered person has died. Linkage of the population register with the cause of death certificates yielded information on primary causes of death.

Data analysis
Survival time was calculated as the time from the initial AMI admission date in 1995 to the date of death from any cause, or a patient was censored at the date of loss to follow-up in the population register (4% of patients, e.g. in case of emigration) or the end of study at December 31, 2000, whichever came first. Crude short-term (28-day), 1-year and long-term (5-year) mortality risks were computed for diabetic and nondiabetic patients. Cox proportional hazard analyses were used to examine the association between DM and overall survival in men and women. DM (yes/no) and other predictors, including age (continuous), previous cardiovascular disease (yes/no) and ethnic origin (native or non-native Dutch) were included in the models. Furthermore, Cox proportional hazards models were used to determine whether gender, age, previous cardiovascular disease and ethnic origin were independently associated with overall survival in patients with DM and patients without DM. Interaction terms were included in the models to assess the interaction of gender with DM, age with DM and age with gender.

During admission, 18% of the diabetic patients (men 16%, women 20%) and 13% of the nondiabetic patients (men 11%, women 18%) died. In both diabetic and nondiabetic patients, AMI was the most frequent cause of death (during hospitalization 71 and 82%, respectively, and during 5 years of follow-up 39 and 45%, respectively).

In the multivariate analyses, gender differences in mortality in nondiabetic patients varied over time with a higher mortality in women at 28 days and a higher mortality in men at 5 years (28-day HR 1.11; 95% CI 1.03–1.20, 5-year HR 0.93; 95% CI 0.88–0.98). Largely comparable, yet not significant, gender differences in mortality were found in diabetic patients (28-day HR 1.09; 95% CI 0.89–1.34, 5-year HR 0.93; 95% CI 0.82–1.04).

Discussion
Our study provides nationwide estimates of the difference in mortality after a first hospitalized AMI between diabetic and nondiabetic patients. Long-term mortality was significantly higher in diabetic patients than in nondiabetic patients. Yet, there were no significant differences in short-term mortality. Risks appeared to be equally elevated in men and women.
Some aspects of the study need to be addressed. In our study, the presence of DM was merely based on information from hospital admissions and on a retrospective period of maximal 5 years. As a result, the estimate of the effect of DM is likely an overestimate due to selection of the more severe cases (those hospitalized with or due to DM), while a fairly limited number of people with less severe stages of DM (not requiring hospital care) will be diluted in the large group of people who truly did not have DM.
11
]. However, if cofactors such as the presence of poorly treated hypertension or dyslipidemia become the focus of investigation, the lack of more detailed information from the hospital register renders such analyses impossible.
In our study, the percentage patients with a cardiovascular history (other than AMI) was about 2 times higher in diabetic patients than in nondiabetic patients. To be sure that the worse prognosis of diabetic patients compared to nondiabetic patients was real and not merely a reflection of the difference in cardiovascular history, we repeated the analyses in diabetic and nondiabetic patients without a cardiovascular history. These analyses yielded similar findings.
2
] then this may result in less clear differences over the rest of the first 28 days, because the early deaths were not recorded. Therefore, the study population does not represent (the diabetes distribution of) all first AMI patients in the Netherlands, but specifically hospitalized first AMI patients, and results might differ from population-based studies, which usually manage to include the out-of-hospital deaths.
As data on patients without an AMI were not available, we were not able to compare the effect of DM on mortality in patients without an AMI with the effect in patients with an AMI, i.e. whether survival after an AMI is particularly worsened beyond the poorer prognosis already conferred by the presence of DM itself.

In conclusion, our findings in an unselected cohort covering a complete nation show that diabetic patients are at an increased risk of long-term mortality after a first acute myocardial infarction. Yet, there are no significant differences in short-term mortality. Risks appear to be equally elevated in men and women. These results stress the importance of secondary prevention by lifestyle advice and drugs in diabetic patients after a first AMI.
