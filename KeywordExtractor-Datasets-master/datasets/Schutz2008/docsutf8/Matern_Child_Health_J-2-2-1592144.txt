Family planning services are necessary for the widespread adoption of preconception care for two reasons. First, preconception care is more likely if pregnancies are planned, and family planning services encourage pregnancy planning. Second, family planning services usually include counseling, and counseling provides an opportunity to discuss the advantages of preconception care. However, the potential of family planning services to promote preconception care is limited by underutilization of these services and inadequate attention to preconception care during family planning visits. This article suggests ways to reduce these problems.

If all women of reproductive age, or at least those at elevated risk, are to benefit from preconception services, the use of family planning services must be increased and the content of such services expanded. Family planning services are essential for preconception care for at least two reasons. First, in the absence of such services, pregnancies will occur that have not benefited from preconception care. Preconception care during the reproductive years is dependent on women and men planning their pregnancies, not only in respect to their timing but also to health-related factors that would maximize the chances for a healthy pregnancy and a healthy infant. In the absence of such care, offered by family planning services, many pregnancies will not benefit from preconception advice. Second, family planning counseling provides an opportunity for promoting and providing preconception care. At the same time women and their partners are receiving advice about family planning, they can also receive instruction about the range of activities that lead to healthy pregnancies and healthy infants.
Unfortunately, several factors prevent family planning from reaching its maximal potential for preconception care. These include underutilization of family planning services and inadequate attention to preconception counseling during family planning visits.

Underutilization of family planning services
Two types of data point to underutilization of family planning services with implications for decreasing opportunities for preconception care: the percentage of women actually seeking family planning services and the percentage of unintended pregnancies.
Visits for family planning

]. This percentage is not as alarming as it might appear at first glance, because some of the women who did not seek family planning services already were pregnant, seeking to become pregnant, or infertile because of sterilization or other reasons. Nevertheless, this rather low percentage suggests that some women are not planning their pregnancies either deliberately or because they are experiencing problems obtaining family planning services.

]. This attitude is probably not widely held, rather most women and their partners have some preferences in terms of the timing of births. This may be expressed in terms of age, marital status, or attainment of some educational, career, or economic goal. Despite this, a large percentage of pregnancies are unintended, including those that were experienced earlier than wanted (mistimed) or those that were not wanted at the time they occurred or at any future time (unwanted).

]. Further, the need to take a pill daily even in the absence of frequent intercourse creates problems for many women. Finally, the absence of a male contraceptive other than sterilization and the condom is a major barrier to effective and ongoing contraception.
The availability of one effective family planning method, emergency contraception (meant as back-up protection, not as a primary method), is currently limited by the refusal of the federal Food and Drug Administration to allow it to be sold over the counter and by the refusal of some pharmacists to fill prescriptions for this medication.



Inadequate attention to preconception counseling

In all likelihood, it may be most difficult to change patterns of family planning practice among physicians in private practice. In contrast, those in HMOs have the potential for exposure to more education about the need for such counseling. The establishment of standards for family planning services by the Health Plan Employer Data and Information Set (HEDIS) might also accelerate change. However, standard setting and financial and other incentives may be most effective when used with community health centers and health department and other publicly-funded sites of family planning services - as the women who use seek family planning at these sites may be those most in need of preconception care. Because such sites are funded by federal, state, and local governments, these units can insist that preconception care be integrated into their family planning services.

Conclusions
Progress towards preconception care for all women will only be possible if a larger percentage of women and men plan their pregnancies. At present, although visits for contraceptive advice and methods provide an excellent opportunity for counseling about ways to achieve healthy pregnancies and healthy infants through preconception care, this potential is not being achieved. Increased use of family planning and increased attention to preconception care within family planning services may require that additional resources be devoted to public and professional education and to service delivery standards and financing.
