Bullous pemphigoid (BP) is a subepidermal skin blistering disease characterized immunohistologically by dermal-epidermal junction (DEJ) separation, an inflammatory cell infiltrate in the upper dermis, and autoantibodies targeted toward the hemidesmosomal proteins BP230 and BP180. Development of an IgG passive transfer mouse model of BP that reproduces these key features of human BP has demonstrated that subepidermal blistering is initiated by anti-BP180 antibodies and mediated by complement activation, mast cell degranulation, neutrophil infiltration, and proteinase secretion. This model is not compatible with study of human pathogenic antibodies, as the human and murine antigenic epitopes are not cross-reactive. The development of two novel humanized mouse models for the first time has enabled study of disease mechanisms caused by BP autoantibodies, and presents an ideal in vivo system to test novel therapeutic strategies for disease management.

], resulting in tense, fluid-filled vesicles. BP is both an inflammatory disease and an autoimmune disease, characterized by an inflammatory infiltrate at the site of the dermal–epidermal junction separation and by the deposition of autoantibodies and complement components along the basement membrane zone (BMZ).

Immunopathogenesis of experimental BP in the murine model
Development of an in vivo system to study an experimental BP model has allowed for great progress in defining the etiopathogenesis of disease. Specifically, the roles of pathogenic antibodies, the complement system, inflammatory cells, and proteolytic enzymes have all been elucidated in the context of the murine IgG passive transfer model.

]. This epitope overlaps the region of the human BP180 NC16A that contains the immunodominant epitopes recognized by human BP autoantibodies, supporting the relevance of this murine system as a model for human disease.

]. Anti-mBP180 autoantibodies trigger skin blistering in wild-type mice and mice deficient in T, B, or both T and B cells, but fail to induce lesions in mice deficient in mast cells, macrophages, or neutrophils. Quantification of disease severity in these mice demonstrated that mast cells and neutrophils play a key role in experimental BP.

]. Depletion of neutrophils, or disruption of the events upstream of neutrophil infiltration (complement activation and MC degranulation), renders mice resistant to BP blister formation. However, complement system and MC deficiencies only confer protection from the pathogenic effects of BP180 autoantibodies if neutrophil infiltration is blocked as a consequence; that is, complement activation and MC degranulation are only critical to disease progression in their roles of neutrophil recruitment. This suggests that infiltrating neutrophils are the cells that directly cause tissue injury in the dermal–epidermal junction, leading to BP skin blisters.

]. IgG passive transfer experiments identified one pathogenic epitope (referred to as BP180NC16A2.5). BP180NC16A2.5-specific autoantibodies induced subepidermal blisters in the NC16A+/+ mice, and these blisters were blocked by pretreatment with recombinant BP180NC16A2.5. We also found that the NC16A2.5 pretreated mice had significantly reduced levels of BMZ-bound and circulating pathogenic antibodies and showed reduced complement activation, mast cell degranulation and neutrophil infiltration. These results suggest that targeting the pathogenic epitope specifically could be a new therapeutic strategy to treat BP.

] that replaces the mouse BP180 (COL17) with the human analogue. Upon injection of human anti-BP180 autoantibodies, these mice reproduce the DEJ separation at the lamina lucida, the deposition of human IgG along the DEJ, and an inflammatory cell infiltrate consisting of neutrophils and eosinophils seen in human disease. The pathogenic effects of the autoantibody injection are ablated by pretreatment with a 77-amino acid peptide fragment of COL17 NC16A, referred to as R1. These studies further support the therapeutic potential of employing decoy peptides to block the pathogenic epitope.

] also reported that total IgE isolated from BP sera, when injected into human skin grafted onto athymic nude mice, triggered a dermal infiltrate composed of neutrophils, eosinophils, and histological separation of the epidermis from the dermis. These findings implicate eosinophils in BP; however, a direct link between eosinophil recruitment and blistering in these human skin graft models needs to be established.

Conclusions

] has provided an invaluable tool for the dissection of the mechanism of disease progression. The development of humanized murine models of BP now provides unprecedented insight to the pathogenic role of the autoantibodies that mediate disease. Initial observations with these humanized models indicate that humanized mouse BP exhibits phenotypic and immunological similarities with murine and human BP. Additionally, these humanized models enabled the first identification of pathogenic epitopes in human disease. Blocking of the pathogenic epitope with decoy peptides, if they do not enhance the autoimmune responses, presents a novel clinical therapeutic strategy that may be very effective in abolishing the pathogenic effects of disease.
