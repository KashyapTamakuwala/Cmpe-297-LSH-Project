The use of prisms in cases of decompensated heterophoria is an established treatment modality. The clinical literature lacks consensus upon the appropriate use of prisms, and fails to provide the necessary evidence base. While the experimental literature can guide the practitioner, the lack of double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies needs to be addressed.

]. The use of a measure such as the “comfortable prism”, while clinically appealing, is highly subjective in nature, and would also require a clinical evidence base to prove efficacy. There is considerable work still to be done in the field of clinical management of binocular vision dysfunction in order to provide the required evidence base.

]. Where prism treatment is being considered, obtain a prior measurement of the associated phoria, insert the prism to be prescribed into the trial frame and measure the associated phoria with the prism in situ. Allow the patient to wear the prism for 10 minutes; if the associated phoria returns to the value measured prior to insertion of the prism, then the patient’s vergence adaptation mechanism has been strong enough to overcome the prism, and it will have little clinical benefit. Conversely, if no vergence adaptation is observed, the patient is likely to derive significant clinical benefit from this treatment.
