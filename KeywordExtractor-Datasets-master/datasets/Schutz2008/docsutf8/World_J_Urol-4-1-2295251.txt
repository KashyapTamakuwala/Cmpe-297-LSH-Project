The treatment of metastasized renal cell carcinoma (RCC) still represents a formidable challenge, despite the development of small molecule, tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) that have made a major impact on the disease. Although the percentage of patients achieving a partial response or stabilization of disease has been impressive, these effects are mostly non-durable. Additionally, drug-related side effects can be quite severe. Alternative treatment modalities might be monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). mAbs against RCC-associated antigens have been developed and have shown promise. Additionally, current efforts focus on Bevacizumab that recognizes vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). VEGF overexpression in RCC provides the opportunity to inhibit this proangiogenic pathway. Also with Bevacizumab, promising results have been obtained, particularly in combination with other treatment modalities. It is likely that mAbs, either as single agents or in combination with other agents, may become useful additions to the armamentarium to diagnose and treat RCC.

], which represents 80–85% of localized cases and 90–95% of metastatic RCC (mRCC). The loss of a functional VHL gene product leads to accumulation of the transcription factor HIF-1α that is an obligatory element for the transcription of several genes. This includes vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and carbonic anhydrase 9 (CA9), targets for which most clinical experience with mAbs in RCC has been generated (Bevacizumab and G250, respectively).
The rationale and effects of Bevacizumab and G250-directed therapy are fundamentally different: Bevacizumab treatment leads to VEGF-depletion and consequently to diminished neovascularization followed by tumor cell death, mainly due to loss of vascularization. In contrast, G250 treatment targets the cell surface of RCC cells where it must exert toxic effects. Both approaches have advantages and disadvantages. Bevacizumab treatment has the advantage that VEGF depletion can be achieved in the circulation, and homing to all tumor vessels is not necessary. However, other regulatory pathways can also lead to neovascularization and small, non-vascularized tumor loci will not be affected. G250 treatment has the advantage that RCC cells can be targeted, irrespective of tumor size. However, in view of the generally poor perfusion rate and high interstitial fluid pressure in RCC, deep penetration of tumors may be difficult. Also, since G250-binding alone does not confer a lytic signal to RCC cells, tumor cell kill requires effector cells or coupling of G250 to toxic agents.

Bevacizumab

]. Survival was a secondary end point. In this randomized phase II trial, 116 patients with metastatic, refractory clear cell RCC were randomized to placebo, low-dose (3 mg/kg) Bevacizumab, or high-dose (10 mg/kg) Bevacizumab given intravenously every 2 weeks. All patients had prior disease progression while on systemic treatment; the vast majority had received prior interleukine-2. Patients with disease progression on placebo crossed over to receive low-dose Bevacizumab. Bevacizumab treatment resulted in a significant prolongation of the time to progression of disease in the high-dose antibody group (4.8 months as compared with 2.5 months). Possibly, the low-protein dose was inadequate to sufficiently deplete circulating VEGF levels in-between injections, explaining the poor outcome in this group. The study was inadequately powered to show a significant difference in overall survival between groups. Based on this encouraging result, Bevacizumab has been combined with other treatment modalities to augment the therapeutic index.

 = 0.0670), which leads to the conclusion that the combination of Bevacizumab with IFN-α2a is superior to either of the single treatment regimens in mRCC. The working mechanism explaining the superiority of this combination treatment has not been defined yet, but most likely the superiority is the net effect of the reduction of the immunosuppressive effects due to decreased VEGF levels combined with the immunomodulatory effects of IFN.

16
]. All patients with SD demonstrated some degree of tumor shrinkage. Similar to the working mechanism of the Bevacizumab/IFN combination, the anti-tumor effects are possibly the result of the reduction of the immunosuppressive effects due to decreased VEGF levels combined with the general immune activating effects of IL-2. Interestingly, treated patients demonstrated an increase in the number of regulatory T cells without effect on DC activation. Larger, randomized studies will be necessary to address the value of this combination treatment.

]. Thus far, these treatments appear to lead to extended survival time. The apparent clinical benefit appears to be quite substantial with a documented median survival of 22 months in patients with metastatic RCC who have progressive disease at study entry. Nevertheless, it is difficult to judge the value of this treatment. Clearly, randomized trials are necessary to unequivocally demonstrate whether passive immunotherapy with cG250 is of benefit for metastatic RCC patients.
The largest trial, which is currently ongoing, is the adjuvant ARISER trial (adjuvant Rencarex immunotherapy phase III trial to study efficacy in nonmetastatic renal cell carcinoma). In this phase III randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial, patients with ECOG performance status of 0 with completely resected primary clear cell RCC and no evidence of remaining local or distant disease, are treated. The study is designed to detect a significant difference between the two treatment arms with respect to disease-free survival; patients will be followed-up long-term to determine overall survival statistics.

I-labeled cG250, a very high specificity and sensitivity to identify ccRCC in patients with suspect renal masses was demonstrated, a clear indication of the potential clinical utility. Whether this imaging modality can be used to follow therapy effects remains to be determined.
In conclusion, it is reasonable to assume that Bevacizumab and G250 monoclonal antibodies either as single agents or in combination with other agents may become useful additions to the armamentarium to diagnose and treat (cc)RCC. Several trials evaluating the combination of G250 or Bevacizumab with registered RCC treatments are currently in progress and will further define the role of these mAbs in RCC.
