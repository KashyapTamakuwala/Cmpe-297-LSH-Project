Objective
To describe a microsurgical alternative to endoscopic third ventriculocisternostomy.

Methods
Two children with shunt-dependent hydrocephalus and multiple shunt revisions were considered candidates for third ventriculocisternostomy (TVS). Because of slit ventricles, an endoscopic approach was not possible and, therefore, both patients received a microsurgical TVS by a supraorbital approach.

Results
In both cases, microsurgical TVS was successful and the patients became shunt free.

Conclusion
Microsurgical TVS by a supraorbital craniotomy is a viable alternative to endoscopic TVS in selected cases.

Introduction

]. Also, ETV is more and more offered to patients with shunt at the time of shunt malfunction or in case of slit-ventricle syndrome (SVS) as a means to become shunt independent. However, in a subpopulation of patients, ETV is technically not feasible due to small ventricular system or slit ventricles. Patients with such small ventricles and multiple shunt malfunctions possess a highly therapeutic challenge.

TVS by lamina terminalis fenestration is still a routine procedure in aneurysm surgery for subarachnoid hemorrhage, especially in case of anterior communicating artery aneurysms. However, the possibility of a microsurgical TVS (MTV) for obstructive hydrocephalus seems to be lost to oblivion by the widespread use of ETV.
In this report, we describe two patients in whom an ETV could not be performed because of slit ventricles and who became shunt independent after MTV by a minimally invasive supraorbital approach.

The largest problem, however, became the frequent absenteeism from school because of these headaches. Chronic consultation of a pediatric neurologist and conservative treatment measures did not alter the symptoms either.

], five shunted patients with aqueduct stenosis and slit ventricle syndrome described are treated successfully with MTV via opening of the lamina terminalis. The lamina terminalis was approached in all patients via a classic pterional craniotomy. Since then, reports on ETV dominate the literature.
Operative technique
Many neurosurgeons consider craniotomy and MTV too large and risky a procedure. However, the procedure described in this report is a truly minimally invasive procedure. The operation time is about 1 h, the wound and scar are minimal, recuperation is very fast, and the potential risks are very low. One might even suggest that this procedure is safer than an ETV because it has an extracerebral approach, in contrast to ETV, and that surgery is better controlled with more opportunities for hemostasis.

]. The Sylvian fissure needs not to be dissected. The ipsilateral optic nerve and the optic chiasm, the ICA and the ipsilateral ACA as well as the ACoA are exposed after which the lamina terminalis is reached. Lamina terminals fenestration is a standard procedure easily performed with the bipolar forceps or an arachnoid diamond knife. This, however, is not sufficient. It is essential to open Liliequist’s membrane to allow free and sufficient CSF communication between the posterior fossa and the suprasellar and frontobasal cisterns.
Recovery of this operative procedure is fast and without major side-effects. Usually, hospitalization time is 2 to 3 days.


Conclusion
In conclusion, open microsurgical third ventriculocisternostomy by opening the lamina terminalis should be kept in mind as an alternative technique for treating patients with multiple shunt failures and small ventricles not accessible for an endoscopic approach in an effort to make these patients shunt independent.
