Small, benign, or low-grade malignant tumors located in the neck of the pancreas are usually treated with enucleation. However, if enucleation is too risky because of possible damage of the main pancreatic duct, standard pancreatic resections are performed. Such operations can lead to impaired long-term exocrine–endocrine function. Middle segment pancreatectomy consists of a limited resection of the midportion of the pancreas and can be performed in selected patients affected by tumors of the pancreatic neck. Middle segment pancreatectomy is a safe and feasible procedure for treating tumors of the pancreatic neck; in experienced hands it is associated with no mortality but with high morbidity, even if the rate of “clinical” pancreatic fistula is about 20%. Moreover, it allows a surgeon to preserve pancreatic parenchyma and consequently long-term endocrine and exocrine pancreatic function.

Surgical Technique
The abdomen is entered through a midline incision. The gastrocolic ligament is opened, preserving the gastroepiploic vessels, and the pancreatic gland is exposed. The posterior peritoneum along the superior and inferior margin of the pancreas is incised. The superior mesenteric vein and the portal vein must be identified and their surfaces cleared below the gland. The plane between the superior mesenteric and portal vein should be teased apart. The splenic artery and vein are dissected free and separated from the gland. Some venous tributaries to the portomesenteric axis and some minor collaterals of the splenic artery can be ligated. Then, the posterior surface of the pancreatic neck is isolated from the portomesenteric axis and a ribbon is passed behind the gland to elevate it. Sutures are placed along the superior and inferior margins to indicate where the proximal and distal transection should be performed and to ligate those vessels running along the margins. The segment of the pancreas with the tumor is subsequently transected through a knife or a stapler to the left and to the right of the lesion. The cephalic stump is sutured with interrupted stitches after elective ligation of the Wirsung’s duct or by means of a stapler. A small stent is placed in the main pancreatic duct while performing pancreojejunostomy or pancreogastrostomy; the stent can be left in place, even if in our experience we have never done it. Two closed-system suction drains are used to drain the cephalic stump of the gland and the pancreaticojejunostomy/pancreaticogastrostomy.

: this means careful selection of patients. In fact, the small number of patients who underwent this type of operation is related to different factors: specific localizations of the neoplasm, well-selected indications (benign or low-grade malignant tumors), and a distal pancreatic stump of at least 5 cm in length.

 have reported that this operation can be performed only in the case of small tumors (<5 cm in diameter); in our experience, although the mean diameter of the resected lesions was 27.4 mm, we have safely performed middle segment resection for tumor measuring more than 5 cm, harboring from the anterior face of the pancreas.

.
In the past we have also performed this operation for malignant tumor but we had pancreatic recurrence of the tumor in two patients (one affected by metastasis and one by intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms [IPMN] with in situ carcinoma); moreover, two patients with adenoma and borderline main duct IPMN had a tumor recurrence in the pancreatic gland. Thus, we believe that in patients affected by primary or metastatic malignant tumor, a standard resection would be more appropriate. Moreover, middle pancreatectomy in our experience should also be avoided in patients affected by IPMN, especially main duct type because of their potential malignity and the possibility to have different degrees of dysplasia along the Wirsung’s duct in the same patients.
The surgeon must be sure to achieve tumor-free proximal and distal resection margins after performing middle segment pancreatectomy and, for this reason, frozen section examination is mandatory.

—was 51%. It is remarkable that most patients complained of Grade A fistula, which is a “biochemical” fistula without any clinical impact, whereas 13 patients (21%) developed a grade B or C fistula, which required prolonged in-hospital stay. In almost all patients the conservative management was successful; no one underwent reoperation and in four cases intraabdominal collections were treated with ultrasound-guided drainage. The mortality rate was zero.
The risk of developing a pancreatic fistula must be taken into account in the preoperative decision making; we believe that this risk is acceptable when the procedure is performed in a high-volume center and for patients with a long-life expectancy, such as young or middle-aged people affected by benign or low-grade tumors.

 showed, in a review of the literature, no case of impaired endocrine function in 59 evaluable patients whereas exocrine function was reported to be normal in 56 out of 59.

In conclusion, middle segment pancreatectomy is a safe and technically feasible surgical approach for removing pancreatic neck tumors in well-selected patients; in experienced hands it is associated with no mortality but with high morbidity. Most of the complications do no require reoperation or prolonged in-hospital stay and can be successfully managed conservatively. Moreover, it allows the surgeon to preserve pancreatic parenchyma and consequently long-term endocrine and exocrine pancreatic function.
