This paper provides a review of the literature on the nervous system involvement incurred by children and adolescents with chronic kidney disease (CKD), with a particular focus on neuropsychological functioning. In addition to an historical overview of earlier literature, published studies from the past 14 years that address both central and peripheral nervous system function in children with CKD are reviewed (1990–2003). These studies span work in neuroimaging, electrophysiology, and neuropsychology. A key focus for this review is on variables that might affect neurodevelopmental status in these children. The paper concludes with suggestions for achieving progress in the understanding of this complication of kidney disease in children.

The purpose of this paper is to review the contemporary published literature that focuses on the neurological impact of CKD in children. Papers selected for this review have been published from 1990 to the present, and were selected to coincide with the improvements in treatment, including the diminution of aluminum exposure and availability of erythropoietin that occurred circa 1990. These studies span work in neuroimaging, electrophysiology, and neuropsychology to address central nervous system (CNS) function. We also present available studies addressing the integrity of the peripheral nervous system.

MRI documented CNS infarcts or ischemic changes from both silent and clinically significant cerebrovascular events in 19 (58%). Although relevant for children with CKD, the frequency of brain structure abnormalities in these specific disorders may be greater than in a general pediatric CKD population with a variety of renal diseases.

Key variables affecting neurodevelopmental outcomes
CKD is a complex disorder and, similar to other pediatric disorders, there are undoubtedly a variety of variables that contribute to the neurodevelopmental status of this population. Key variables presented here are postulates for the most part as the studies conducted since 1990 have not been adequately powered to assess multiple influential factors.

Conclusions
Emergent findings appear to apply to three broad groups of children and adolescents: mild-to-moderate CKD, dialysis-dependent children, and transplant-dependent children. What is known about children with mild-to-moderate CKD is severely limited, with no focused studies addressing their neurodevelopmental needs. More is known about the pediatric dialysis population, with deficits in the areas of attention, language, visual-spatial abilities, and memory. However, the differentiation of problems that may relate to disease-specific variables, such as age at onset of kidney failure, anemia, and hypertension, remain relatively unknown and modestly examined at best. For the transplant-dependent group, cognitive deficits appear to persist, supporting the conclusion that the transplant does not result in complete neurocognitive “recovery.”

]. Ideally, this study or set of studies will include measures of neuroimaging, electrophysiology, and neuropsychology. Future research in this area should characterize potential risk factors, such as age at onset of disease, anemia management, and hypertension to advance our understanding of the magnitude of cognitive dysfunction and aid the identification of modifiable mediators of CNS deficits in children with CKD.
