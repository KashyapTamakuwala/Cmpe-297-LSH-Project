In this article, we follow the history of one of the most abundant, most intensely studied proteins of the eukaryotic cells: actin. We report on hallmarks of its discovery, its structural and functional characterization and localization over time, and point to present days’ knowledge on its position as a member of a large family. We focus on the rather puzzling number of diverse functions as proposed for actin as a dual compartment protein. Finally, we venture on some speculations as to its origin.

Introduction
that a long time ago it was a scientific breakthrough to show that actin exists at all,

that it took years and years to convince truculent groups of actin pioneers that a non-muscle cell contains actin as well,

that actin is not a singular and once for all invention in evolution, but is the founder of a large family of isoforms and related proteins, and

that quite a number of these proteins can be found in different subcellular compartments. For example, it has been established as a regular component of both, the cytoplasm and the nucleus; but this perception is the result of a fight that went on for decades.




The dawn: actin as a muscle component
1859
1887
). He compared it to blood clotting and the transformation of fibrinogen to fibrin. In tedious experiments he extracted mammalian muscle tissue at different time scales, temperatures, salt concentrations and found that myosin apparently needed an additional component to perform fast aggregation and contraction. Without really knowing it, Halliburton worked with actin and produced with this so-called “myosin ferment” an actomyosin precipitate. In our days one reads Halliburton’s publication with some amazement. The report covers 70 pages and looks with its descriptions and tables like a lab-book, e.g.: “Extract #1—10 a.m.—Diluted with an equal amount of water—10 a.m. next day—No change”. Surely, at that time editors were not as busy as they are today.

Muscle actin comes of age
1992
2004
).
It is far beyond the scope of this review to cover the avalanche of actin and myosin research that started after those first molecular characterizations. Of course, muscle was and still is the major source to purify actin from, and, consequently, the research during the following decades used exclusively muscle actin.

Actin conquers the cytoplasm
But as it is in science, one opens one door and discovers ten closed ones. Keeping that in mind a scientist should always be suspicious regarding dogmas of all sorts. For some time it was almost a law that actin exists only in skeletal muscle and that the well-known conventional myosin is the only motor protein which turns the world go round. Today it is a common place that both assumptions were wrong, although it was quite a task to convince the scientific community.

Actin as the prototype of a large family
Today conventional actin is thoroughly studied, with respect to its polymerization and depolymerization equilibrium, its function in the cytoskeleton as a morphological stabilizer, its role during motile activities of a cell, its three-dimensional structure, its binding partners, etc. But the traitorous word in this sentence is “conventional”. What hides behind “conventional” actin? And what is an actin-related protein?

). They came to the conclusion that almost 30% of the studied proteins have similar structures but different functions.
Coming back to actins and Arps. Is it possible that the name “actin” for all of these proteins is utterly misleading? Are we wasting time in our search for cytoskeleton-related activities just because the fold triggered a wrong name? Is the so-called actin fold another example for a successful superfamily which contains only a few proteins that play a role in the cytoskeleton, while many other members are e.g. subunits of larger protein complexes in chromatin or hexokinases or proteins with yet unknown functions?

). However, these observations still did not overcome the scepticism at that time—it took another two decades to recognize actin as a dual compartment protein that can execute different functions by selectively associating with ligands specific either for the cytoplasm or the nucleus.

Actin and Arps in the nucleus
In the last 20 years, studies on nuclear actin became fashionable, and now a new area began which firmly established actin, its relatives and binding partners as nuclear components.
Cell biologists began to understand that proteins are not necessarily confined to a single intracellular compartment. Numerous examples proved that proteins may shuttle between intracellular regions and even adopt different, compartment-specific activities. Shuttling of actin and actin-related proteins between the nucleus and the cytoplasm cannot be considered any longer as an exceptional, exotic behaviour.

Drosophila
, showed that activities specific for the nucleus, like chromatin remodelling or transcription required the presence of the beta actin isoform, in a configuration that could bind to nuclear protein complexes, but were inhibited with actin mutants that failed in this respect.

The development of cell biological and immunological methods over the past 20 years, like cellular expression of flurorochrome-tagged proteins in conjunction with video microscopy, and the generation of epitope-characterized monoclonal antibodies allowed to follow actin trafficking throughout the cell and its location in the nucleus.

). The brave reader who works himself through all this information will arrive at two conclusions: the actin-like proteins have definitely conquered a firm position among the group of respectable, important nuclear proteins, and they seem to be involved in a plethora of different activities. While the tasks for actin in the cytoplasm all are connected with the conventional G- and F-actin structures and the dynamic equilibrium between these two states, nuclear functions of these proteins seem associated with several different forms or configurations which are ill or even not at all defined.
In the following paragraphs, we will briefly mention the most important tasks proposed for nuclear actins.

Conclusions
So, have we now lost the student being confronted with actin for the first time in his scientific education, or have we been able to attract his curiosity for this abundant, highly conserved, mysterious protein?
