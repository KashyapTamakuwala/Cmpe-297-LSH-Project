Nylon membranes were pre-hybridized at 65°C for 3 h in 5× SSC, 0.1% sodium lauroylsarcosine, 0.02% SDS and 1% blocking reagent (Boehringer Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany). Hybridization was then performed overnight at 65°C in the same buffer with single-stranded cDNA probes. Hybridized membranes were rinsed twice for 5 min with 2× SSC and 0.1% SDS at room temperature, and twice for 10 min with 0.1× SSC and 0.1% SDS at 65°C.

Color reactions were developed overnight at 37°C with nitro-blue tetrazolium chloride (NBT) and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (BCIP), and reactions were stopped with TE buffer (10 mM Tris–HCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0). Sections were photographed with Kodak ISO 100 film under a bright field Olympus BH-2 microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). To demonstrate the specificity of in situ hybridization, control hybridizations were performed without DIG-labeled probes.

Bound fusion protein was eluted with a final denaturing elution buffer (8 M urea, 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer [pH 4.0], 500 mM NaCl). Recombinant proteins were dialyzed against a buffer containing 10 mM Tris (pH 8.0) and 0.1% Triton X-100, according to the manufacturer’s protocol. As a control, thioredoxin was purified using a native buffer that did not contain urea.

To analyze CaPMEI1 inhibition of PME, 1 μL inhibitor solution (0.5 mg CaPMEI1 fusion protein, 10 mM Tris buffer [pH 7.5], 0.1 M NaCl) was mixed with 10 μL PME (7.8 mU) and 0.5 μL 3 M K-acetate buffer (pH 5.3), followed by incubation for 15 min at room temperature. All reaction temperatures were maintained at 25°C. Reaction rates were recorded continuously at 340 nm using a DU650 UV-visible spectrophotometer (Beckman, Fullerton, CA, USA). PME–PMEI interactions were determined by measuring the rate of NADH formation per minute at pH 7.5 and 25°C.

) containing 200 or 600 mM mannitol. The seeds were maintained at 4°C for 48 h under dark conditions to synchronize germination, and then transferred to a growth chamber. Experiments were repeated at least three times, using approximately 100 seeds.
Surface-sterilized seeds were also used for examination of relative root length. Seedlings were grown on plates placed vertically in growth chambers and root length was estimated for 14 days. To assess mannitol tolerance, seedlings were grown for 7 days in 1× MS agar media supplemented with 1% sucrose, and then transferred to wells containing 1× MS liquid media supplemented with 100, 200, 300 or 400 mM mannitol. For drought treatment, 4-week-old soil-grown plants were deprived of water for 15 days and then re-watered on day 16. To minimize experimental variation, both the transgenic and control plants were grown in the same tray. Experiments were repeated at least three times.
For transpiration rate measurements, leaves of 4-week-old plants were detached and maintained at room temperature. Leaf weight was determined every 20 min for 2 h, and then every 1 h thereafter. Each measurement was performed using eight leaves. Experiments were repeated at least three times with similar results.

Here, we have determined that CaPMEI1 from pepper plays a role as an antifungal protein and has an inhibitory effect on PME. Furthermore, we have shown that Arabidopsis CaPMEI1-OX lines are resistant to bacterial pathogens. In addition, they exhibit tolerance to drought and oxidative stress. In conclusion, these multivariate functions of CaPMEI1 provide valuable insights into understanding the physiological significance of PMEIs in plant disease resistance and abiotic stress tolerance.
