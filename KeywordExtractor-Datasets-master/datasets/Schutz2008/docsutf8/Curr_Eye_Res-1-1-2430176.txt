In branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO), abnormal arteriovenous crossing with vein compression, degenerative changes of the vessel wall and abnormal hematological factors constitute the primary mechanism of vessel occlusion. In general, BRVO has a good prognosis: 50–60% of eyes are reported to have a final visual acuity (VA) of 20/40 or better even without treatment. One important prognostic factor for final VA appears to be the initial VA. Grid laser photocoagulation is an established treatment for macular edema in a particular group of patients with BRVO, while promising results for this condition are shown by intravitreal application of steroids or new vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors. Vitrectomy with or without arteriovenous sheathotomy combined with removal of the internal limiting membrane may improve vision in eyes with macular edema which are unresponsive to or ineligible for laser treatment.

BACKGROUND
Method of Literature Search
Eligible studies were identified through a comprehensive literature search of electronic databases (Medline, 1966–September 2007 and Science Direct, all years). Additional articles were selected from review of the reference lists of the articles generated from the above search. The following keywords and combinations of these words were used in compiling the search: branch retinal vein occlusion, retinal circulatory disorders, pathogenesis, hematological disorders, risk factors, therapy methods, visual prognosis. In total, 150 of these were used for this mini-review.

Pathogenesis
The pathogenesis of RVO is multifactorial while BRVO may be due to a combination of three primary mechanisms: compression of the vein at the arteriovenous (A/V) crossing, degenerative changes of the vessel wall, and abnormal hematological factors. In the following sections these factors are discussed.

 In these cases, collateral systems often develop. The main purpose of the treatment is to decrease the duration of edema to prevent photoreceptor damage, if no spontaneous improvement occurs.


Clinical Signs and Diagnosis

55
 In all patients with RVO, the systemic risk factors (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, blood lipid disorders) should be investigated and managed by appropriate specialists.

). Many studies that examine interventions for BRVO suffer from methodological limitations, including insufficient power resulting from small sample sizes, short follow-up periods, absence of a control group or inappropriate control group (absence of placebo or best practice intervention as control groups), and lack of distinction between clinical entities. A number of such investigations have therefore produced conflicting data. Hence, the results of randomized clinical trials are the most important. The complex pathogenesis of this disease requires investigation and treatment of all risk factors (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, blood lipid disorders, hematological disorders).

 but the results were based only on noncomparative interventional series. There is no general current acceptance of this treatment.
68
 in a double-blind study, examined the platelet aggregation inhibiting effect of ticlopidine in 54 patients with BRVO less than 3 weeks from the onset of symptoms. Compared with placebo therapy a significant improvement in VA was observed with ticlopidine therapy for six months. In the treated group, 69% of patients experienced an improvement in VA, whereas 52% of placebo group reported improvement.

69
 At 4 months follow-up, more of the patients receiving troxerutin treatment had a mean VA of 20/40 or better than the control group, although this difference was not found to be statistically significant. After 4 months, all patients were treated with troxerutin for 2 years. At the completion of this follow-up period for those patients initially treated with troxerutin, a significant improvement in VA and improvement of ME was demonstrated. The limitation of this study is that there is no separation in the analysis of results for patients with BRVO and CRVO who were included in the study, too.
Both studies mentioned that investigated the medical treatment of BRVO are limited by a small sample size and short follow-up period (6 and 4 months).

The use of hemodilution to treat BRVO is currently not generally accepted. Interpretation of the above-mentioned studies is difficult because most of them incorporated other treatments in combination with the hemodilution. Further prospective randomized trials with adequate controls and sufficient follow-up are required for any definitive conclusions and recommendations.

 compared in a randomized clinical trial, the short-term effect of intravitreal versus retrobulbar injection of TA for the treatment of ME caused by BRVO. Sixty patients received either a single intravitreal injection (4 mg) or repeated retrobulbar injections (40 mg, three times) of TA. The first injection in the retrobulbar group was given approximately one week after focal laser photocoagulation. Foveal thickness, macular volume, and improvement in VA were significantly better after intravitreal injection than after repeated retrobulbar injections. The need for re-injections was significantly greater in the retrobulbar group than in the intravitreal group.

Prospective, controlled studies are mandatory to develop standardized treatment protocols that allow safe and effective application of anti-VEGF drugs.

Laser Treatment
Laser treatment is an established method for use in patients with BRVO. A large number of publications concerning the role of photocoagulation in the management of BRVO have appeared. Various laser techniques can be used: macula grid photocoagulation and the method of arterial crimping for treatment of ME, and peripheral scatter photocoagulation for treatment of retinal and/or disc neovascularization.

 the improvement in VA was higher in a group of patients receiving the MLG combined with arteriolar constriction than in a group treated by MLG only. However, the difference in the resolution of ME between the groups was not statistically significant. The authors suggest that arteriolar constriction in addition to grid pattern laser photocoagulation is more effective for resolving ME in patients with BRVO.




CONCLUSIONS
The pathogenesis of BRVO is multifactorial. Its resulting visual loss is due primarily to ME, macular nonperfusion, and retinal neovascularization. A large number of treatments have been advocated in its management. Unfortunately, almost all of these lack sufficient evidence for their effectiveness. Randomized prospective trials are essential. The only one established treatment for ME is macular grid photocoagulation in patients with BRVO longer than 3 months and a VA of 20/40 or worse. Additionally, the initial VA may play a crucial role in the prognosis of BRVO and determinates the final VA.
