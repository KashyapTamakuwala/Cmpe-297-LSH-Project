Background
Isolated limb perfusion (ILP) with tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and melphalan, followed by delayed surgical resection and adjuvant external-beam radiotherapy is a limb salvage treatment strategy for locally advanced soft tissue sarcomas. The long-term vascular side effects of this combined procedure were evaluated.

Methods
Thirty-two patients were treated for a locally advanced sarcoma of the upper (n = 5) or lower limb (n = 27). All patients underwent a noninvasive vascular work-up.

Because little is known with respect to the late vascular morbidity of the combined procedure of ILP and EBRT, a retrospective study was conducted to evaluate the long-term locoregional vascular side effects of ILP, followed by delayed surgical resection and adjuvant high-dose EBRT.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
15
16
 Perfusion was followed by delayed local resection of the tumor remnant, and in cases of marginal or microscopically positive resection margins, high-dose postoperative EBRT was considered.
In 2005, 39 patients were still alive and in follow-up. Information about their past and current oncological and vascular status was obtained from the follow-up notes in the medical records. Seven patients were unable to participate in the study because of severe or advanced morbidity or comorbidity (n = 2) or because of nonmedical reasons (n = 5). Consequently, 32 patients, 14 men (44%) and 18 women (56%), with a median age of 47 (range, 14–71) years, were included (response rate, 82%). They completed a vascular checklist that asked questions about their medical vascular history, and they were screened for risk factors of vascular disease, such as smoking, hypertension, and diabetes. A blood sample was drawn to determine the cholesterol spectrum, which was used as an indicator of risk for atherosclerosis. All patients underwent a noninvasive arterial and venous vascular work-up that comprised duplex ultrasonography and vascular pressure measurements. The ankle-brachial index (ABI) and pulsatility index (PI), which are indications of vascular blood flow velocity, were measured to indicate the arterial status of the limb. For evaluation of veins, ultrasonography was performed to detect DVT and insufficiency. All investigations were performed by the same examiner (J.L.).

Two patients underwent vascular reconstruction after en-bloc tumor resection with the artery. One patient underwent a reconstruction of the femoral artery with an infragenual femoral-popliteal bypass, and the second patient underwent a popliteal artery reconstruction with an autologous vein graft. A DVT in the lower leg was diagnosed in the postoperative period in three patients (7.7%).
Nine (23%) of the 39 alive patients underwent a lower limb amputation at different levels after ILP with or without EBRT. No amputations of the upper extremity were performed. In two patients with microscopically involved resection margins, an amputation of the affected limb was indicated because adjuvant radiotherapy was contraindicated. One patient underwent amputation due to tumor recurrence 18 months after ILP and EBRT. Amputation was performed for critical leg ischemia due to atherosclerosis in two patients at 110 and 125 months after ILP and EBRT. Because of severe obstruction of the crural vessels, reconstructive therapy was not suitable.

Arterial Vascular Disease
With a median follow-up of 88 (range, 17–159) months, no patient experienced peripheral arterial occlusive disease. With duplex ultrasonography, however, two patients showed a complete arterial occlusion at the level of cannulation (6%). One of them underwent an iliac perfusion and EBRT because of a STS of the lower leg in 1993. After 10 years, she had signs of critical leg ischemia, which required a transfemoral amputation. She is now free of pain and can walk with a well-functioning prothesis. The other patient showed an axillary occlusion 10 years after an axillary perfusion, followed by resection and EBRT at the forearm. She did not have any symptoms of arterial occlusive disease, and her arm functions normally. Duplex ultrasonography showed good collateral flow. Two other patients (6%) showed an arterial stenosis at cannulation level at 22 and 30 months after axillary perfusions, followed by EBRT at the upper arm and axilla in one and systemic chemotherapy in both patients. They had normal arm function without any signs of ischemia.
The arteries at resection level were also evaluated. One patient with a fossa poplitea STS had complete occlusion of the superficial femoral artery 6 years after ILP and EBRT, with open arteries below knee level. A femoral-popliteal bypass was considered but was not performed because of the absence of any symptoms. At the time of evaluation, the ABI was .50; the patient did not have any complaints besides compression ulcers on his feet, which responded well to conservative therapy. The patient who needed an autologous vein graft of the popliteal artery has a stenosis at this level without clinical signs of arterial occlusive disease.
Twenty-two of the total 32 patients included underwent ABI measurements; 22 had their PI determined at the femoral level and 20 at the popliteal level. Five patients were excluded because of amputation of the limb; another five were excluded because of a STS located in the upper limb. Of the remaining 22 patients, 18 received postoperative EBRT for the above-described indications.

Venous Vascular Disease
Many patients had some symptoms of venous insufficiency, such as lower limb pain, feelings of heaviness and discomfort, night palsies, paresthesia, and edema. One patient (3%) wore compression stockings because of superficial vena saphena magna insufficiency, and one patient (3%) had unilateral superficial varicosis in the treated leg. Another three patients (9%) showed uni- or bilateral deep insufficient venous vasculature by duplex ultrasonography, which in all cases was located at the level of resection. One DVT (3%) and one partial venous obstruction (3%) were found, both at the resection level. Venous vascular obstruction was not seen at the level of cannulation.

 In case of repeated ILP in the same limb, perfusion through more proximal arterial and venous sites is recommended because fibrosis at the previous operative site does not allow insertion of the cannulas at the same level. All patients in this study underwent only one ILP.

 However, amputations due to long-term complications like critical leg ischemia, which was performed in two patients (5.1%), have not been described in other studies. Furthermore, three complete (9%) and one partial (3%) arterial occlusion were found after the combined procedure.
Fortunately, these patients did not have invalidating symptoms of arterial occlusive disease. In most cases, vascular pressure measurements and duplex ultrasonographic evaluation showed statistically lower values compared with the contralateral extremity, but these were still within the normal range. This could explain the absence of symptoms.
28
 In our study, six of seven patients with an abnormal femoral PI underwent iliac perfusion. This implies a vascular reaction at the level of cannulation. Furthermore, seven patients showed a decrease in popliteal PI compared with the femoral PI, which implies that vascular damage is present at a more proximal (i.e., cannulation or resection) level. However, with the present data, it is not possible to support this thesis because of the relatively small study population, and the absence of symptoms and other abnormal outcomes of the vascular work-up.
It is important to realize that blood vessels lose their elasticity with the years and are subject to the normal process of atherosclerosis. Furthermore, unilateral peripheral arterial occlusive disease is common. However, the fact that lower rates of ABI and PI were found in the treated leg in almost all patients and that no marked difference was found between younger and older patients makes the assumption of treatment-induced differences plausible.
29
 showed that adjuvant EBRT seems beneficial in all patients, so it might be impossible to evaluate the sole effects of ILP on the vascular system in the future.
Major late vascular complications after the combined procedure, like critical leg ischemia necessitating amputation, were found in two patients in this study. One patient had no risk factors for peripheral arterial occlusive disease besides smoking. He had had intermittent claudication 8 years after ILP and EBRT, and a normal ABI of 1.09. His condition did not improve after 2 years of conservative therapy and reconstruction was impossible, so he underwent an amputation 125 months after the initial limb salvage treatment strategy. The second patient, who had diabetes mellitus and familial cardiovascular disease, experienced no complications the first few years after ILP and EBRT. After 6 years, she experienced a pathological proximal tibia fracture due to radiation-induced osteonecrosis in the previous surgically treated area and needed to wear a brace. She lived for 3 years with a disabling function impairment of the knee and then developed signs of critical leg ischemia. An upper leg amputation was performed 110 months after the initial treatment. She now walks with a well-functioning prothesis.
.

Recently, one patient was successfully treated with thrombectomy for an acute popliteal artery occlusion. This patient, who underwent an ILP at femoral level followed by EBRT for a STS in the fossa poplitea 5 years before, had no complaints of peripheral arterial occlusive disease during his vascular work-up for this study 10 months earlier. ABI (1.03) and femoral PI (6.3) were normal; popliteal PI was low (5.3). With duplex ultrasonography, some atherosclerosis in the femoropopliteal section was seen. This patient has diabetes and hypertension, is obese (body mass index >30), and was a former smoker, so he was especially at risk for developing atherosclerosis.
This study shows that despite the importance of preventing major late vascular complications after the combined procedure of ILP and EBRT, a routine noninvasive vascular work-up does not seem to add value to normal follow-up. It is more important to realize that patients after the limb salvage treatment strategy of ILP, followed by delayed tumor resection and EBRT, are at risk for late vascular complications. This risk is substantially raised when personal risk factors such as smoking, diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and hypercholesterolemia are present. Because symptoms of vascular complications can be masked by the normal effects of the treatment itself, the possibility of vascular morbidity should be considered if the patient has any complaint. Furthermore, all patients must be convinced of the importance of reducing their additional personal risk factors for atherosclerosis.
In conclusion, objective measurements show a time-related decrease (>5 years’ follow-up) of ABI and femoral PI in the treated leg, usually without subjective complaints. ILP followed by delayed resection and EBRT for a locally advanced STS can lead to major late vascular morbidity that requires amputation.
