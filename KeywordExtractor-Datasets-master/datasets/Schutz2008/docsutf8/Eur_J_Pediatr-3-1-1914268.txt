Introduction

]. Traditionally, research in this area has focused on developmental consequences at a very young age. In addition, the effects of NE have often been treated as an all-or-nothing phenomenon; patients have been believed to show a completely normal development or become severely disabled. So far, few studies have looked at milder consequences of NE at school age.
From perinatal asphyxia to neonatal encephalopathy

]. This wide range can be largely attributed to problems in selecting indicators to identify children with PA. As a consequence, researchers have used many different sets of inclusion criteria when studying the effects of PA. For this reason, it is difficult to compare results regarding developmental outcome of infants with PA across studies.

]. The presence of moderate or severe NE and metabolic acidosis (pH <7 and base deficit ≥12 mmol/l) are considered to be essential markers for hypoxic ischemic injury. In addition, these criteria underline the importance of excluding other identifiable causes of NE before assuming asphyxia as the underlying etiology.

] is still widely used and the basis for most modern classification systems. In this review, the Sarnat system is used to grade NE because in most studies that were included this system it had been applied. According to the Sarnat system children are assigned a score of 1, 2 or 3 (1= mild NE; 2= moderate NE; 3= severe NE). Stage 1 lasts less than 24 h and is characterized by hyperalertness, uninhibited Moro and stretch reflexes, sympathetic effects and a normal EEG. Stage 2 is marked by obtundation, hypotonia, strong distal flexion and multifocal seizures. Infants with the most severe stage of NE (stage 3) are stuporous and flaccid, and brain stem and autonomic functions are suppressed. In addition, the EEG shows abnormal patterns of brain activity.

To gain insight into the long-term effects of NE on development, follow-up is required throughout the school-age period. Specific cognitive functions continue to develop throughout childhood. As it is impossible to examine a function that has not developed yet, short-term follow-up cannot exclude minor cognitive and behavioral difficulties at school age. Moreover, subtle functional deficits usually do not become apparent until a child faces increasing demands to master complex abilities in school.

]. Children with moderate NE without CP at this age performed in the average range or above, although the range of scores varies widely across studies. In addition, other studies in which the Denver Developmental Screening Test or the Bayley Scales of Infant Development were used reported normal development in children with mild NE, none of whom had CP.

In these domains, all children with severe NE were more than one grade behind the expected level for their age. The group with moderate NE appeared to have distinct difficulties in reading, spelling and arithmetic/mathematics. Writing has been found to be less developed in only one subgroup of one of the studies.

]. However, the inclusion criteria differed considerably from those of Sarnat. Both groups can be classified as moderate NE when Sarnat’s criteria are applied. In addition, the authors explicitly did not exclude etiologies of NE other than PA.

Discussion and conclusion
In the introduction section of this review, problems were mentioned with regard to the comparability of different outcome studies of NE. Even after careful selection on the basis of predetermined criteria, comparing studies remained difficult. The main reason for this was the way test results were presented. In many cases, outcome of the children was reported in two or more categories, e.g., normal/mildly delayed/abnormal. One of the problems that arise due to such categorization, is the subjectivity involved in determining the cut-off points of the categories. Often, these cut-off points seemed to be chosen arbitrarily or not justified at all. Another issue that adds to this problem is the use of different tests of development, cognitive ability or behavioral problems. One can hardly compare, for example, the proportions of children with developmental delay in two studies when these are represented by a score below 85 on the Bayley Scales of Infant Development in one of the studies and by a score below 70 on the Griffiths Mental Developmental Scales in the other. To enable readers to compare studies, results of significance testing between subgroups of children with NE and comparison groups were added to the tables whenever available.
12
24
]. Of the children without CP, those with mild NE have an excellent prognosis. Their intelligence, educational achievement and neuropsychological functions are comparable to healthy peers at least until middle childhood.
Children with severe NE appear to be impaired in every cognitive domain. They are less intelligent and perform worse at school and at neuropsychological tests than both healthy controls and children with mild or moderate NE.
32
29
50
] appears to be very useful for the prediction of the outcome of children with mild or severe NE, in case of moderate NE this qualitative system lacks predictive power. Future research should therefore focus on developing a reliable, more gradual model of prediction.
21
58
]. However, these findings, which were based on small numbers of children, do not justify generalization to all children with NE and should therefore be replicated in larger, well-defined samples.
1
60
]. These findings suggest that, in addition to cognitive impairment, children with NE could be at risk of developing behavioral problems. Because of the clinical implications this would have, future research should include behavioral monitoring of all children with NE.
48
]. Recommendations include assessment of general cognitive and adaptive behavioral functioning at preschool age, and, in some cases, school achievement tests and a neuropsychological screening at school age. The authors of this review would like to go one step further in recommending standard screening for behavioral problems in all children with NE, regardless of their level of cognitive functioning. In addition, detailed neuropsychological assessment is recommended especially in all children with moderate NE.
From this review it is concluded that general intellectual, educational and neuropsychological outcomes are consistently positive for children with mild NE and negative for severely affected children. However, children with moderate NE form a more heterogeneous group with respect to outcome. On average, intelligence scores are below those of children with mild NE and age-matched peers, but within the normal range. Difficulties have been found in the domains reading, spelling and arithmetic/mathematics. So far, neuropsychological functioning of children with NE has received relatively little attention. The studies that were selected for this review have yielded ambiguous results in children with moderate NE. A few studies suggest elevated rates of hyperactivity in children with moderate NE and autism in children with moderate and severe NE. Therefore, behavioral monitoring is required for all children with NE. In addition, systematic, detailed neuropsychological examination is needed especially for children with moderate NE.
