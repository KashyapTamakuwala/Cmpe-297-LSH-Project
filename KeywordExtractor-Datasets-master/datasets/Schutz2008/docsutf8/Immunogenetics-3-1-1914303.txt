). Therefore, approximately 1 cm of the trachea was collected in 500 μl of Verwey medium. Bacterial suspensions were diluted in Verwey medium, and the number of CFU was determined by plating on Bordet Gengou agar supplemented with 15% sheep blood and 30 μg/ml streptomycin (Tritium Microbiology, Veldhoven, The Netherlands). Plates were incubated for 4 days at 35°C before counting the number of CFUs using a ProtoCOL Colony counter (Synbiosis, Cambridge, UK).

Transcription profiling
Lungs were incubated in RNAlater (Qiagen) at 4°C for 1 day, after which, the tissues were transferred to a fresh tube and stored at −80°C. RNA was extracted by using the midi-RNA isolation kit (Qiagen). RNA concentrations were measured using a NanoDrop Spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE). RNA quality was determined using the 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) and was expressed as the RNA Integrity Number (RIN) as defined by the manufacturer. Only samples with a RIN score of at least eight (on a 1–10 scale) were used for expression profiling.

 region spotted in duplicate (Isogen Life science, IJsselstein, The Netherlands), as well as appropriate controls and blank spots.
Based on RNA quality and yield, RNA isolated from six mice per group was selected for amplification and labeling. RNA amplification and labeling were carried out using the Amino Allyl MessageAmp II aRNA kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) using 1 μg of total RNA as starting material. RNA samples from individual mice were labeled with Cy3. A common reference containing a RNA pool of all samples isolated was labeled with Cy5. After hybridization and washing, the arrays were scanned using a ScanArray 4000XL microarray scanner (Perkin-Elmer, Wellesley, MA).

As expected, most upregulated genes are involved in immune and inflammation-related processes, such as antigen presentation, complement, cytokine, and chemokine activity. Other processes involved include the acute phase response and metabolism. Most downregulated genes are involved in nonimmune processes, such as metabolism, development, cell cycle, or muscle contraction. We speculate that by downregulating these genes, the energy balance is shifted in favor of the immune response. Evidently, cellular influx in the lungs is likely to influence the gene-expression profile.
