Background
In addition to increased risks of morbidity and mortality, extreme obesity is substantially associated with psychosocial problems. Therefore, the ultimate goal of bariatric surgery should not only be reducing weight and counteracting comorbid conditions but also improving psychosocial functioning. In addition to being an important goal of bariatric surgery, enhanced psychosocial functioning may motivate patients to adhere to adequate health behavior to maintain the surgically established weight loss.

Methods
We evaluated early postoperative psychosocial functioning in several domains over time. Preoperatively as well as 6, 12, and 24 months after vertical banded gastroplasty, 104 patients were psychologically assessed using a semi-structured interview and psychological questionnaires focusing on psychosocial functioning, personality, and body image.

Results
Over time, we found significant changes in weight: 2 years excess weight loss was 58.6%. In addition, most aspects of psychosocial functioning showed significant improvements over time. However, initial improvements in depressive symptoms, sleeping problems, and neuroticism did not last. With respect to personality features, only short-term changes in self-esteem were found. The most robust improvements were seen in the case of body image. Finally, within the patient group, there was a wide variability in changes.

Conclusion
Vertical banded gastroplasty not only leads to considerable weight loss but also to significant improvements in psychosocial functioning. However, some improvements waned over time, and successful postoperative functioning did not apply to all patients.

]. To facilitate the identification of the psychological variables that are related to success and the development of treatment interventions to enhance adjustment and success, a better understanding of patients’ psychosocial functioning after bariatric surgery is needed.

Materials and Methods
The present study was designed to increase our understanding of patients’ changes in psychosocial functioning, personality, and body image during the first 2 years after vertical banded gastroplasty (VBG). The main research questions were: what specific improvements can be achieved, is postoperative functioning noticeable different from functioning in relevant normative groups, and do all patients profit? These questions were examined based on data collection preoperatively and 6, 12, and 24 months after VBG.

From these 131 patients, 104 (79.4%) could be included in our study; others did not respond to our repeated requests for follow-up or sending back questionnaires. The studied patient group consisted of 91 (87.5%) female and 13 (12.5%) male patients. Preoperatively, they had a mean age of 38.4 ± 8.3 years, an average body mass index (BMI) of 45.4 ± 5.1, and a mean percentage excess weight of 104.5 ± 22.1%.

]. Compared to those normative groups, mean preoperative scores for psychosocial functioning were significantly higher, except for hostility. However, with respect to preoperative neuroticism, no significant difference was found. Postoperatively, there was a mixed picture. In spite of these inconsistencies, the overall picture revealed that on most subscales and most follow-up assessment points, patients’ mean scores were not significantly different from the corresponding scores obtained in the normative groups. Two years after surgery, patients’ mean scores on measures of sleeping problems and somatic complaints were again significantly higher than the normative group’s scores. As to neuroticism, patients’ postoperative mean scores were significantly lower than the normative group’s scores on all follow-up assessment points. Despite these differences, all postoperative patients’ scores fell in the below mean, mean, or above mean categories of the normative groups’ scores.

], we did find some significant differences. Compared to a relevant normative group, reflecting the general population, patients’ mean preoperative scores on social anxiety, dominance, and self-esteem were not significantly different. However, they were after surgery, albeit not on all follow-up assessment points and not always for both sexes. Postoperatively, patients’ scores on social anxiety were lower, whereas their scores on dominance and self-esteem were higher than the corresponding scores obtained in the normative group. On scales of Hostility and Egoism, preoperatively, patients had significant lower mean scores; postoperatively, this was only the case for some small subgroups. On the Rigidity measure, patients had significantly lower mean scores on all measurement moments preoperatively as well as postoperatively. All patients’ mean scores fell in the below mean, mean, or above mean categories of the normative group’s scores.

Heterogeneity in Postoperative Psychosocial Functioning

].
In the present study, in addition to a large variation in EWL, we found substantial variance with respect to changes in psychosocial functioning. Especially with respect to psychoneuroticism and neuroticism, most patients reported postoperative improvements; however, this was not the case for all patients. For instance, in the case of psychoneuroticism, 77 out of 99 patients (77.8%) reported improvement after 6 months; in contrast, 21 patients (21.2%) had higher scores, and one patient did not change. After 24 months, approximately two thirds of the patient group (64.7%) still had better scores on psychoneuroticism, whereas one third (31.4%) showed signs of an increase in psychoneuroticism.
In the case of personality characteristics, a mixed picture was found; however, in general, there were only small differences between patients reporting positive or negative changes. Regarding body image, almost all patients reported improvements, and these were quite stable over time.


Discussion
After vertical banded gastroplasty, in addition to substantial and significant weight loss, patients also changed for the better in body image and most domains of psychosocial functioning. With respect to personality, only a significant improvement in self-esteem was found. Unfortunately, there was substantial variance in improvements, and some improvements waned over time.

]; furthermore, because of the stability of personality, these findings might be expected. The impact of bariatric surgery seems to be more in the areas of symptoms of psychopathology.

]. These outcomes underscore the suggestion that vertical banded gastroplasty, just like other methods of bariatric surgery, is not equally effective for each patient.
37
].
Although we found mixed results, the overall psychosocial improvements provide additional justification for vertical banded gastroplasty as a surgical treatment option for extreme obesity. However, as some improvements wane over time and not all patients profit in the same way, surgery alone may not be sufficient to sustain success. Consequently, additional behavioral treatment may be necessary.
