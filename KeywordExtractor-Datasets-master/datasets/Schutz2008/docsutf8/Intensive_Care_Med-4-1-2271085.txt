Conclusions
Estimation of SVI by cylinder or truncated cone based algorithms is not reliable for clinical decision making in patients undergoing CABG surgery. A more robust approach for estimating bioimpedance based SVI may exclude inconsistencies in the underlying algorithms in existing thoracic bioimpedance cardiography devices.

A4-Fthermodilutioncatheter(PulsiocathPV2014 L16) was introduced into the femoral artery and connected to a commercially available CO device (PiCCO, Pulsion,Munich, Germany). Transpulmonary thermodilution cardiac output (TPCO) was measured by quadruple injections of 15 ml ice-cold saline into the right atrium and used for transpulmonary thermodilution stroke volume calculation.

Discussion
TD
 during the perioperative period in CABG patients. However, significant deviations were found, and accurate clinical decision making was not possible based on absolute values or changes in bioimpedance SVI. No single algorithm was superior to another. Interestingly, application of the Wang algorithm produced consistent underestimation, whereas the two other algorithms overestimated SVI. Our study differed from previous studies in several important aspects. Raw voltage data were measured and used for off-line calculation of bioimpedance SVI on the basis of different bioimpedance algorithms commonly used in commercially available devices. Therefore data were obtained without using different bioimpedance devices and calculation was independent from built-in proprietary software algorithms. Measurements were performed not only in the operating room but also in the intensive care in ventilated as well as in spontaneously breathing patients.

There is need for a more robust mathematical approach (see Electronic Supplementary Material), including an increase in the number of voltage measurement input streams, an accurate description of the physics of current density distributions and taking into account the full spectrum of all relevant patient anatomical variabilities.
