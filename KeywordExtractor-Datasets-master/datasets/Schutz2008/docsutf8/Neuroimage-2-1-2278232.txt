Abstract
location
supramodal.
 Activation within this network was however modulated by language (BSL/English), hearing status (deaf/hearing), and age of BSL acquisition (native/non-native). The influence of language and hearing status suggests an important role for the posterior portion of the left inferior frontal gyrus in speech-based phonological processing in deaf people. This, we suggest, is due to increased reliance on the articulatory component of speech when the auditory component is absent. With regard to age of first language acquisition, non-native signers activated the left inferior frontal gyrus more than native signers during the BSL task, and also during the task performed in English, which both groups acquired late. This is the first neuroimaging demonstration that age of first language acquisition has implications not only for the neural systems supporting the first language, but also for networks supporting languages learned subsequently.

) of speech and sign. Picture stimuli also allowed us to tap individuals' own phonological representations of words and signs. Previous studies of rhyme judgement with hearing people have used auditory or written stimuli, which directly or indirectly provide the phonology of the item. To determine whether rhyme judgements in response to pictures elicit the pattern of activation reported in studies using written words, hearing participants were also tested. Including this group also allowed us to directly contrast activation patterns observed in deaf and hearing participants to determine the effect of hearing status on the neural systems supporting phonological processing.

The following research questions were addressed: are the same neural networks recruited during phonological decisions based on signed and spoken language? What is the impact of age of signed language acquisition and hearing status on this network?

All deaf participants reported being born profoundly deaf and audiograms obtained at the time of testing confirmed that all had a mean hearing loss greater than 92dB in the better ear over four octaves, spanning 500–4000Hz. All deaf participants encountered written English upon entering primary school, aged 4/5. Twelve of the deaf participants were native signers, having acquired BSL from their deaf, signing parents. The remaining eight deaf participants (non-native signers) had hearing parents. One native signer and one non-native signer reported attending schools which used a total communication approach, in which signs are used to support spoken English. The remaining 18 of the 20 deaf participants had attended ‘oral’ schools in which spoken English was the main form of communication. This educational approach was the norm for this generation of deaf adults in the UK, even for those who used BSL as their native language. Of the eight non-native signers, five learned BSL after leaving secondary school, aged 17 to 21. One participant learned BSL at their total communication primary school aged 4/5. Two other participants who attended oral schools reported learning BSL at school; one aged 4/5, the other aged 11. These participants will have been exposed to BSL by their deaf native signing classmates.

Rhyming pictures were re-paired such that there was no overlap in signed or spoken phonology to form the ‘no’ trials in the location task (e.g., chair–whale). Likewise, location pairs were re-paired to form the ‘no’ trials in the rhyme task (e.g., hat–pig). Thus, the same stimuli were presented in both tasks.

Thus, of the 60 pictures seen in both experimental conditions, 45 were also presented in the ‘same picture?’ control condition. Whether an item was first seen in the experimental or control condition was counterbalanced such that any repetition effects were balanced across conditions.
All participants performed a picture naming pre-test before the scan session. If an unexpected label was generated, the desired English word or BSL sign (deaf participants only) was supplied. Correct naming of these items was checked again at the end of the pre-test session.


Design
Deaf participants performed the rhyme and location similarity judgement tasks in separate, counterbalanced runs. Hearing participants performed only the rhyme task. Each run consisted of six 30-s blocks of the experimental task (rhyme or location), alternating with six 30-s blocks of the ‘same picture?’ control task. Each run lasted 6 min.

). It is possible that selection demands increase for bilinguals because responses from both first and second languages are available. This situation applies to native signers (first language: BSL; second language: English), but may apply to a greater extent to non-native signers. Deaf non-native signers have knowledge of both BSL and English; however, both languages are acquired late. Despite equivalent behavioural proficiency on our tasks, both languages are likely to be poorly established in non-native signers, leading to greater conflict between potential responses, possibly resulting in enhanced recruitment of the left IFG.

 propose that the left IFG is involved in cognitive control, while the ventral premotor cortex demonstrates phonology specific properties. The relative role of these regions in language processing, and phonological processing in particular, will be greatly informed by future studies examining different domains of language (phonology, syntax, semantics) within the same group of deaf late language learners, while manipulating age of acquisition and proficiency.

Both of these lines of evidence suggest that orthographic representations may be activated in both deaf and hearing participants when making spoken language phonological decisions in response to pictures. Further studies are needed to examine this hypothesis and the role of the left parietal lobe in phonological processing.

Whether this activation is specifically related to linguistic processing or to more general processing of body-related information requires further investigation, using linguistic tasks exploring both comprehension and production, and non-linguistic tasks.

 We show that a similar neural network supports phonological processing of both signed and spoken language in signed language users born profoundly deaf. Furthermore, this network was also engaged by hearing non-signers performing the similarity judgement task in English. However, different parts of this network were differentially weighted depending upon language modality, hearing status and, most importantly, age of first language acquisition. These data highlight the importance of learning a language, whether signed or spoken, early in life. Early acquisition of a first language is critical not only for processing that language, but also appears to form a base on which subsequently learned languages can successfully build.

Schematic representation of order of events during the: (A) rhyme (English); (B) location (BSL); and (C) ‘same picture?’ judgement tasks. The first trial in each example block is a ‘yes’ trial and the second is a ‘no’ trial. In the actual task, trial order was randomised.

 < 0.005). The left dorsal IFG and the medial portion of the SFG (shown in orange) were engaged to a greater extent during the rhyme than location task. The left SPL (shown in green/blue) was engaged to a greater extent during the location than rhyme task. View (A) provides the best illustration of the left IFG activation; view (B) provides the best view of the extent of activation in the SFG and the parietal lobe. Activated voxels up to 25mm beneath the cortical surface are displayed. Plots represent the mean % signal change across all voxels in the activated cluster across all participants. Error bars represent the standard error of the mean.



Fig. 5
(A) Main effect of Group: non-native signers engaged the left inferior frontal gyrus to a greater extent than native signers. Critically this was the case during both the location and rhyme tasks (see text). (B) A significant Group × Task interaction was also identified in the left posterior IFG/precentral gyrus. Non-native signers recruited this region to a similar degree during both rhyme and location tasks. Native signers engaged this region more during the rhyme task, performed in English which was learned late, than the location task performed in their native language (see text). Activated voxels up to 20mm beneath the cortical surface are displayed. Plots represent the mean % signal change across all voxels in the activated cluster within each group of participants. Error bars represent the standard error of the mean.
