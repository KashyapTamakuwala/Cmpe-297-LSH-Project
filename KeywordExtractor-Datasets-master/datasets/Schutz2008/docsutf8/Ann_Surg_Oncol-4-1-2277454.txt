Background
With the combined treatment procedure of isolated limb perfusion (ILP), delayed surgical resection and external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) for locally advanced soft tissue sarcomas (STS) of the extremities, limb salvage rates of more than 80% can be achieved. However, long-term damage to the healthy surrounding tissue cannot be prevented. We studied the late effects on the normal tissue using the LENT-SOMA scoring system.

Patients and Methods
A total of 32 patients—median age 47 (range 14–71) years—were treated for a locally advanced STS with ILP, surgical resection and often adjuvant 60–70 Gy EBRT. After a median follow-up of 88 (range 17–159) months, the patients were scored, using the LENT-SOMA scales, for the following late tissue damage: muscle/soft tissue, peripheral nerves, skin/subcutaneous tissue and vessels.

Results
According to the individual SOM parameters of the LENT-SOMA scales, 20 patients (63%) scored grade-3 toxicity on one or more separate items, reflecting severe symptoms with a negative impact on daily activities. Of these patients, 3 (9%) even scored grade-4 toxicity on some of the parameters, denoting irreversible functional damage necessitating major therapeutic intervention.

Conclusions
In evaluating long-term morbidity after a combined treatment procedure for STS of the extremity, using modified LENT-SOMA scores, two-thirds of patients were found to have experienced serious late toxic effects.

 In order to provide an overview of all late toxic effects on the limb treated with ILP, delayed surgical resection and adjuvant high-dose EBRT, a retrospective study was conducted to evaluate long-term morbidity using the LENT-SOMA scoring system.

 Not all patients could be scored on all four items, since in 5 patients (16 %) the affected limb was amputated.

Discussion

 While, at first, selected groups of patients were often excluded from undergoing this procedure, limb preservation has now become a major challenge for all patients with a locally advanced STS.
23
24
25

However, acute toxicity and long-term morbidity due to the combined treatment procedure of ILP, surgical resection and EBRT cannot be prevented. In ILP, normal tissue in the limb is exposed to the same concentrations of cytostatic agents as the tumor. The effects of the perfusate on normal tissue vary widely among individuals and long-term morbidity also varies widely in severity.
As far as we know, this is the first study to assess late functional morbidity with the LENT-SOMA scales in patients treated for STS with ILP, surgical resection and EBRT.

Functional Morbidity

34
 In this study, we found muscle atrophy in almost all patients (96%), which may be due to an extensive surgical resection having been performed after ILP for deep-seated STSs, in contrast to the mostly superficial resection in melanoma patients. Only 4 patients (13%) still needed medical intervention: occasional or regular physiotherapy. However, 14 patients (44%) found that their limb function interfered with daily activities. In only 6 patients (19%) could no functional impairment be objectified.

 In this study, 25 of the 32 patients analyzed (78%) received EBRT. The 3 patients who scored grade-4 toxicity on one or more items all received EBRT. Overall, there was no patient who did not experience any late toxic effect.

In conclusion, the Subjective, Objective, and Management parts of the LENT-SOMA scoring system confirm late toxic effects on surrounding normal tissue in all patients treated with a combined treatment modality for locally advanced STS of the extremity. Two-thirds of the patients have severe Subjective or Objective damage, but half of all patients do not require any Management for their symptoms. To prevent long-term morbidity in the future, efforts should be made to reduce acute toxic reactions after ILP, and a fasciotomy and a customized rehabilitation program are recommended. Furthermore, anti-fibrotic therapies might be considered.
