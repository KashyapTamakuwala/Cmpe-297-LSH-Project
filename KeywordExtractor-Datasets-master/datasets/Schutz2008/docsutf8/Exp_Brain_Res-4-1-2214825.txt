 = 13) had to grasp a rod embedded in a “rod-and-frame” illusion and insert the rod-end into a tight hole in a pre-defined way. The grip type (defined by start posture, either pronated or supinated; and end posture, either comfortable or uncomfortable) used to grasp the rod was registered as a macroscopic variable of motor planning. Different rod orientations forced the participants to switch between grip types. As expected, most participants switched between pronated and supinated start postures, such that they ended the movement with a comfortable end posture. As it has been argued that planning is dependent on visual context information, we hypothesized that the visual illusion would affect the specific rod orientation at which participants would switch into a different grip type. This hypothesis was confirmed. More specifically, the illusion affected the critical spatial information that is used for action planning. Collectively, these findings are the first to show an effect of an illusion on motor planning in a sequential object manipulation task.

) had participants grasp a bar placed in front of a grated background in such a way that an orientation illusion was induced. The bar could be grasped with an overhand grip or an underhand grip. The results showed that grip choice was affected by the visual background. Hence, these findings indicate that the selection, or planning, of a particular grip type is subject to the visual context surrounding the target. In a second experiment, using the same experimental set-up, Glover and Dixon investigated planning and control by measuring kinematic parameters during transport of the hand to the bar. Contrary to the first experiment, participants were not free in their grip choice, and had to use the same, predefined grip during the whole session. In line with the predictions of the planning-control model, hand orientation was affected by the illusion in the initial part of the movement, but this effect decreased when the hand approached the bar. Thus, initial planning, as evidenced by grip type and initial kinematic parameters of the reach, was affected by the illusion, but during transport of the arm the kinematic parameterization was corrected.

), the evidence is restricted to simple prehension tasks that did not demand any further action with the grasped object: the goal of the action was to merely to grasp and lift the object. No studies have yet investigated the effect of visual context in situations where the overarching goal of the action does not coincide with simply grasping and lifting the object. This is surprising, since tasks such as a sequential object manipulation task, in which a target is grasped for a specific purpose, provide a method ‘par excellence’ to evaluate planning processes. By using a sequential object manipulation task, it can be assessed whether planning processes also take the visual context surrounding of an object into account when the overarching goal of the action requires further manipulation of the grasped object.

Procedure
The study consisted of two experimental sessions that were conducted in succession. First, an action task was performed, second we performed a perception task to assess participants’ perceptual sensitivity for the illusion [these tasks are denoted as (1) Action task and (2) Perception task in what follows]. Standard rest breaks were present between sessions, and on participants’ demands.
Action task
The action task consisted of a pre-measurement and the main experiment. The procedure for both was as follows. A trial started when the participant pressed the button on the button-box with the index finger of the preferred (right) hand. Subsequently, the goggles were closed and the second experimenter manually changed the rod and frame orientation. When ready (i.e., within 2 s) the goggles opened, which was the start-signal for participants to grasp the rod as quickly as possible and place it vertically with the marker facing upwards in a hole of a tight fitting box that was located in front of them, slightly to the right of the body midline. Participants were asked to grasp the rod with a power grip, i.e., with the thumb on one side of the rod and the fingers on the other side. Once the rod was grasped, participants were not allowed to change the grip type during rotation of the rod. This was necessary, because it urged participants to plan the task prior to grasping the rod. If this had not been the case and participants were allowed to manipulate the rod in-hand, then it would not have been strictly necessary for participants to plan the movement prior to grasping the rod.

With respect to the grip type, our primary interest was the rod orientation at which a switch into another grip type occurred. The rod orientation at which there was an equal chance to observe both grip types was denoted the “switch point”.

The main experiment
The rod orientations during the main experiment were normalized to the individual switch points, which allowed us to study the individual switch region into detail without overloading participants with too many trials. Measurements were performed in a range of 80° surrounding the individual switch point, separated by angles of 10°. This resulted in a total of nine rod orientations that were tested in the main experiment (−40°, −30°, −20°, −10°, 0°, 10°, 20°, 30°, 40° relative to individual switch point). Negative orientations are clockwise rod orientations compared with the individual switch point, whereas positive orientations are directed counterclockwise to the switch point. During the experiment we also manipulated the orientation angle of the frame, such that the “rod-and-frame” illusion was created. The frame was rotated in either a clockwise (CW) or a counterclockwise (CCW) direction. A total of five frame orientations were used (20° CCW, 10° CCW, 0°, 10° CW, 20° CW) yielding a total of 45 unique conditions. In each condition, five trials were performed in a completely randomized order. The main experiment, involving 225 trials, took about 45 min for each participant.

Perception task
We performed a perception task to assess participants’ perceptual sensitivity for the illusion. It was examined whether different rotations of the surrounding frame affected the perceived orientation of the rod. To that end, two rod-and-frame combinations were sequentially shown to the participant. First, a rod surrounded by a tilted frame was shown, followed by either the same or a different oriented rod surrounded by Frame 0°. In between presentations, the goggles were closed for less than 2 s. Participants had to report if the orientation of the rod was the same or different in the two displays. In the majority of the trials the rod orientation did not change between presentations (for example, when the first display was a combination of Rod −30° and Frame 20° CCW, the second display combined Rod −30° with Frame 0°). In this perception task, 4 frame rotations × 9 rod orientations × 3 repetitions were tested, yielding 108 trials. In addition, we also added 72 “catch trials” (4 Frame rotations × 9 rod orientations × 2 directions of rod changes), where the rod orientation actually did change between the two presentations, either 10° CW or 10° CCW. The main reason to add catch trials was to prevent that participants could anticipate that the two rods were the same in all trials. However, catch trials were not used in the analyses. The total of 180 trials was presented in a completely randomized order. The perception-task took about 45 min to be carried out.


Data analysis
Action task
Analysis of pilot recordings revealed that participants used two strategies to perform the action task. Although all participants used grip type 1 in some of the trials, at the individual switch point differences in grip type choice appeared. While most of the participants switched to an underhand initial posture resulting in a comfortable end posture (grip type 2), some participants switched to an overhand initial posture resulting in an uncomfortable end posture (grip type 3). Consequently, two movement strategies could be delineated. One group of participants switched between grip type 1 and grip type 2 and always ended with a comfortable end posture (this strategy is denoted as “comfortable enders”), whereas the other group of participants switched between grip type 1 and grip type 3 and always started with a pronated initial posture (this strategy is denoted as “pronation starters”).

Discussion
The purpose of the work reported here was to evaluate the influence of visual context on the planning of a sequential object manipulation task. Earlier research on the effects of visual illusions on action was limited to simply grasping a target object without any further purpose. By contrast, in the present study we asked participants to grasp a target object to subsequently place it in a hole. This task requires anticipatory planning, in which constraints arising from the end posture prevail in initial grip choice. That is, the initial grip must accommodate the upcoming movements. As far as we know, no other study has scrutinized visual context effects in such a sequential, object manipulation task. In our study, a rod was embedded in a typical “rod-and-frame” illusion configuration. We used a wide range of rod orientations that would force participants to switch between different grip types if they were to reach a comfortable posture at the end of the task. The effect of visual context on anticipatory planning processes was investigated by measuring if the location of the switch point shifted when the surrounding frame was tilted.

) have proposed that an illusion only effects on action when the critical spatial characteristics of the target in the relation to the to-be-performed action are affected by the illusion. In our study this critical spatial characteristic was the orientation of the rod, whereas in the Dyde and Milner study it was the position of the ends of the rod.

) pointed out, an inherent problem in visual illusion studies is the comparison between the perception and the action task, as these tasks are predominantly measured by different methods, as was also the case in the present experiment. However, although our study does not allow us to compare perception and action in a quantitative way, the perception task did provide information about how participants perceived the rod orientation when surrounded by a tilted frame. Specifically, participants’ perception of the rod orientation was affected by the surrounding frame.
