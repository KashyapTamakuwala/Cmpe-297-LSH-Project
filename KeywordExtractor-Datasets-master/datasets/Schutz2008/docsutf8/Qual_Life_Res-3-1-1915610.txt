Objectives
To compare quantitatively the discriminatory power of the EQ-5D, HUI2 and HUI3 in terms of absolute and relative informativity, using Shannon’s indices.

Methods
N
 = 3,691) were used. Five dimensions allowed head-to-head comparison of informativity: Mobility/Ambulation; Anxiety/Depression/Emotion; Pain/Discomfort (EQ-5D; HUI2; HUI3); Self-Care (EQ-5D; HUI2); and Cognition (HUI2; HUI3). Shannon’s index and Shannon’s Evenness index were used to assess absolute and relative informativity, both by dimension and by instrument as a whole.

Results
Absolute informativity was highest for HUI3, with the largest differences in Pain/Discomfort and Cognition. Relative informativity was highest for EQ-5D, with the largest differences in Mobility/Ambulation and Anxiety/Depression/Emotion. Absolute informativity by instrument was consistently highest for HUI3 and lowest for EQ-5D, and relative informativity was highest for EQ-5D and lowest for HUI3.

Discussion
Performance in terms of absolute and relative informativity of the common dimensions of the three instruments varies over dimensions. Several dimensions are suboptimal: Pain/Discomfort (EQ-5D) seems too crude with only 3 levels, and the level descriptions of Ambulation (HUI3) and Self-Care (HUI2) could be improved. In absence of a formal measure, Shannon’s indices provide useful measures for assessing discriminatory power of utility instruments.

Shannon’s indices are suitable to assess discriminatory power in MAUIs for two reasons: first, they are theoretically based and second, they incorporate the frequency distribution across all categories of a MAUI’s health status classification system (not just the highest and lowest categories, as is the case with ceiling and floor effects).
Our aim is to investigate the discriminatory power of the EQ-5D, HUI2 and HUI3 in a general population sample, as expressed by Shannon’s indices. Informativity was assessed separately by dimension and by MAUI as a whole.

In information theory, the information of a signal is distinguished from the meaning or the semantic content of a signal. Rather, the information is quantified and is identified with uncertainty. Informativity is dependent on the number of classes (e.g. bits or response options) and the distribution of the observations (the ‘signal’) among classes. For classifications, this implies that if one would want to develop a useful (informative) distinction between, say, European countries, distinguishing between Scandinavian and non-Scandinavian countries would be far less informative than distinguishing between Northern, Western, Eastern and Southern European countries. Note that the latter classification not only contains more categories but the countries are also more evenly distributed among categories.

Discussion
We compared the discriminatory power of the EQ-5D, HUI2 and HUI3 in the general population, using Shannon’s indices of absolute and relative informativity, for each dimension separately and by MAUI as a whole.
As might be expected in a general population sample, most respondents reported no problems on all dimensions and there were fewer responses with increasing level severity. An exception is HUI3 Cognition, where respondents reported more problems on levels 3 and 4 than on level 2. This is probably due to the fact that this dimension is not unidimensional, and levels 2 and 3 are conceptualized parallel rather than ordinal. That is, HUI3 Cognition level 2 focuses on problems in thinking and problem solving, level 3 addresses problems in remembering, whereas level 4 combines the problems mentioned in levels 2 and 3.

′ value in HUI3 suggests an alternative contributive factor. One explanation may be that HUI3 Cognition is not unidimensional and more sensitive to mild problems (levels 2–4) than HUI2 Cognition (level 2). Another explanation could be that the difference is due to currently suboptimal recoding algorithms.
2
), which is probably due to the severe grading of level 2 in HUI2. The difference in relative informativity between EQ-5D and the HUI instruments in Anxiety/Depression/Emotion is probably due to the 2 extra levels in HUI2 and HUI3 that are rarely endorsed.
Overall, performance in terms of informativity of EQ-5D, HUI2 and HUI3 of the common dimensions varies over dimensions. The Pain/Discomfort dimension of EQ-5D, but perhaps also other dimensions, might benefit from an extension to 4 or 5 levels. HUI2 and HUI3 might benefit from more sensitive grading terms in their level descriptions, especially the ‘threshold’ level 2, in Ambulation (HUI3) and Self-Care (HUI2).
When assessing informativity by instrument, HUI3 shows the best results on absolute informativity but the lowest on relative informativity while EQ-5D shows highest relative informativity and lowest absolute informativity. HUI2 seems to be the optimal compromise. The importance of differences in the Shannon indices ultimately requires empirical evidence over a wider range of populations, conditions and instruments, including evidence on discriminant validity.
As Shannon’s indices are new in the field of health status measurement, some methodological issues need to be addressed, taking into account that their principal focus is on classifications with mutually exclusive categories, rather than conventional (health status) measures which by design contain multiple partially overlapping items.
The Shannon indices share some properties with reliability coefficients. Like reliability indices, they express discriminatory power. Furthermore, they are also non-dimensional, i.e. they have no relation to the content, meaning or clinical relevance of what the instrument aims to measure, which make them suitable for comparability, between instruments as well as between populations. However, reliability reflects two different concepts: discriminatory power as such, and consistency, e.g. consistency between raters (inter-rater reliability) or consistency over time (test-retest reliability). This requires a repeated measurement (repetition ‘over raters’ or over time) which introduces an error component in case of a difference among the repeated measurements. Shannon’s indices solely reflect discriminatory power, and need only a single measurement. Furthermore, the Shannon indices are non-parametric measures and therefore highly suitable for nominal or ordinal measurement scales.
in that particular population
. This implies that one MAUI cannot be superior in varying populations (e.g. a general population and a diseased population sample). Furthermore, MAUIs are bound to score rather low on discriminatory power in a general population sample, as the extreme categories, which have to be included for coverage of the full spectrum of diseases, will not be endorsed frequently.
Previously, the common approach to investigate discriminatory power was examining the frequency distributions of responses, e.g. for ceiling or floor effects. A comprehensive, formal measure to express discriminatory power such as Shannon’s indices seems clearly superior to such a ‘face-value’ method. Furthermore, when the number of categories is large (e.g. when comparing MAUIs as a whole), it becomes very difficult to make a sound comparison by just looking at the distributions.
We have demonstrated the use of the Shannon indices to compare the discriminatory power of different MAUIs, to show which instrument is more sensitive in differentiating between levels of health in the population at hand. But they may also be used to guide the development of new, or optimization of existing MAUIs, by helping determine how many levels are efficient for each dimension. This is a particularly relevant consideration for MAUIs, since adding extra levels in a descriptive system makes it increasingly complex, and the derivation of a robust set of preference weights more challenging.
Apart from MAUIs, the Shannon indices can also be used in a wide range of other classifications in the medical domain (e.g. the Karnofsky scale, the Spitzer QL index) and in the clinical domain (e.g. the APGAR score, the Child-Pugh classification).
A practical weakness of the Shannon approach is that when the sample size is exceeded by the total number of health states described by all permutations across all dimensions of a MAUI, informativity (for the instrument as a whole) has to be estimated. This implies that using the Shannon Evenness index by instrument is not very practical when a health classification system has a large number of permutations as was the case in HUI3 (972,000 permutations). This however is not a disadvantage of the Shannon methodology per se, but also a matter of classification design (overload of dimensions with detailed response options producing an excessive amount of ‘empty’ permutations), or a practical problem (excessive data collection).

′ is optimal as more categories require more extensive subsequent studies to derive utility functions for the associated classification system.
How the Shannon indices will behave in a different population, such as patient populations, remains to be investigated. So far, Shannon’s indices proved to be useful in showing weaknesses of level gradings used in EQ-5D, HUI2 and HUI3, and offers leads for improvement, establishing their practical psychometric value.
