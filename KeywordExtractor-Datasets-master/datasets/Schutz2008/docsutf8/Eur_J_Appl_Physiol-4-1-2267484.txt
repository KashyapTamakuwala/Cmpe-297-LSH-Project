, negative grade −25%, load 12% of body weight). Neuromuscular test sessions [H-reflex, M-wave, maximal voluntary torque (MVT)] were performed before, immediately after, as well as 1–3 days after the exercise bout. Immediately after exercise there was a −15% decrease in MVT of the plantar flexors partly attributable to an alteration in contractile properties (−23% in electrically evoked mechanical twitch). However, MVT failed to recover before the third day whereas the contractile properties had significantly recovered within the first day. This delayed recovery of MVT was likely related to a decrement in voluntary muscle drive. The decrease in voluntary activation occurred in the absence of any variation in spinal modulation estimated from the H-reflex. Our findings suggest the development of a supraspinal modulation perhaps linked to the presence of muscle soreness.

Introduction

). This inadequate neural drive could be the result from a combination of three factors: the conscious and unconscious will of the subject to reduce the exercise intensity; an inability of the motor cortex to generate sufficient output to maximally activate the muscle; and/or a decreased transmission of the supraspinal input to the muscle by the spinal motor axons.

). Accordingly, this exercise model allows the study of the effects of muscle soreness on alteration in neural drive. Thus the goal of this study was to determine whether the impaired exercise performance of muscles with delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) is due to an alteration in neural drive related to spinal modulation.

Methods
Subjects
Ten healthy subjects (eight males and two females; age 27 ± 1 years; weight 68 ± 2 kg; height 174 ± 2 cm; data in mean ± SEM) gave informed, written consent to participate in this study. The procedures complied with the Helsinki declaration for human experimentation and were approved by the local Ethics Committee. None of the subjects suffered from muscle soreness or ankle injuries. Subjects were asked to avoid caffeine intake within the 8-h preceding the test and to avoid all vigorous activity during the 24-h preceding the test. Subjects were also asked to refrain from analgesic intake all along the protocol, which could have disturbed DOMS perception.

Measurement and calculations
Torque measurement
The MVT of the plantar flexor muscles was recorded by a dynamometric pedal (Captels, St Mathieu de Treviers, France). Subject position was standardized with hip, knee and ankle angulations of 90°, and foot securely strapped on the pedal.

, which is particularly susceptible to be affected by the walking exercise were recorded with 9 mm diameter bipolar Ag/AgCl electrodes (Contrôle Graphique Medical, Brie-Comte-Robert, France) with an inter-electrode distance of 25 mm. The reference electrode was placed on the wrist. Low impedance between the two electrodes (<5 kΩ) was obtained by abrading and washing the skin with emery paper and cleaning with alcohol. Signals were amplified and filtered (band pass 30–500 Hz, gain = 1,000), and recorded at high frequency (2,000 Hz). The compound muscle action potentials were recorded using MP30 hardware (Biopac Systems Inc., Santa Barbara, CA, USA) and dedicated software (BSL Pro Version 3.6.7, Biopac Systems Inc., Santa Barbara, CA, USA). The same equipment was also used to drive the stimulator.

b). Our results support these findings by showing that after a 30-min downhill walking exercise, electrically evoked reflex-wave activity was not decreased. Thus we conclude that non-exhausting walking exercise, sufficient to induce significant DOMS seems not to induce alteration of the spinal modulation.

) showed that central fatigue during repeated isometric contraction is minimized by exhorting the subject to produce a “super” effort at the end of each voluntary contraction. Our results add to that interpretation by suggesting the possibility that supraspinal modulation can also occurs after locomotory activity such as walking, even without exhaustion.

). In this study concerning the plantar flexors, we observed some statistical similarities within DOMS and VA (i.e., lowest value of VA at 48-h when DOMS was the highest and significant recovery for the both at 72-h). However, from a functional point of view, VA returned at control level at 72-h whereas DOMS at 72-h was not less than DOMS at 24-h, and VA decreased after exercise when DOMS was weak. That suggests that subjective DOMS of the plantar flexors can not be considered as an objective indicator of VA capability.

Conclusion
2007
b). The present study showed that a 30-min downhill walking exercise failed to induce the same modification. However there was a significant decrease in VA during maximal voluntary contractions performed during the days after eccentric exercise that produced DOMS. This suggested the occurrence of a supraspinal modulation of muscle activation during this period when muscle contractile properties had fully recovered following the eccentric exercise. Furthermore, the persistence of the decrement for several days suggests that this modulation was not caused by an acute exercise-related physiological or biochemical alteration in the motor cortex, so-called central fatigue but more likely represents a modulation which may be partly linked to the muscle soreness.
