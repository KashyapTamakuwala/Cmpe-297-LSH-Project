Background
The aim of this study was to investigate the long-term limb salvage rate and overall survival after isolated limb perfusion (ILP) with tumor necrosis factor alpha and melphalan for locally advanced soft tissue sarcoma (STS).

Methods
From 1991 to 2003, 73 patients (36 men, 37 women, median age 54 [range 14–80] years) with biopsy-proven STS underwent 77 perfusions followed by delayed surgical resection, with or without adjuvant radiation. Limb salvage and overall survival curves were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method.

Results
A total of 21 amputations (28%) were performed. Overall 1, 5, and 10 years’ limb salvage was 80.1% ± 4.8%, 68.2% ± 6.5%, and 60.6% ± 9.2%, respectively. We found that the risk of amputation was linked to three time periods. The first was within a year after perfusion, mainly as a result of massive necrosis of the tumor and overlying skin, resulting in soft tissue deficit or recurrent disease (n = 17). The second was within 5 years, with two amputations performed for late local recurrence. The third occurred 10 years after perfusion, with two amputations performed for critical leg ischemia. Another two patients developed a pathological fracture of the femur due to radiation osteonecrosis. These four patients received adjuvant radiotherapy. Overall, 1, 5, and 10 years’ survival was 82.9% ± 9.2%, 58.7% ± 13.1%, and 42.5% ± 18.2%, respectively.

Conclusions
ILP treatment with tumor necrosis factor alpha and melphalan followed by delayed surgical resection and adjuvant radiation treatment is an effective limb salvage treatment regimen for locally advanced STS. However, we observed late morbidity, with two amputations performed for critical leg ischemia and two pathological fractures of the femur in patients receiving adjuvant radiotherapy.

 Since 1991, patients with locally advanced STS of the limbs have been treated at the University Medical Center Groningen by ILP with TNF-α and melphalan with or without interferon gamma as perfusion agents, followed by delayed surgical excision and postoperative radiotherapy if a marginal resection or nonradical resection was performed. Recently we encountered long-term local morbidity, and therefore the aim of the present study was to analyze the limb salvage rate and survival in patients with locally advanced STS of the extremities that were treated in our center and to report the late effects of this treatment modality.

 After surgery, patients can be monitored on the recovery ward instead of the intensive care unit.

Assessment of Tumor Response, Tumor Remnant, and Follow-up
21
 Complete response was defined as the disappearance of all measurable disease in the limb for > 4 weeks, partial response as regression of the tumor size by > 50% of the largest diameter for > 4 weeks, and no change as regression of < 50% of the tumor in the limb or progression of < 25% for longer than 4 weeks. Resection of the tumor remnants was performed 2–15 weeks (median, 8 weeks) after perfusion. After resection, response was also assessed by pathological examination. The tumor remnants were measured in three dimensions and the percentage of necrosis estimated in relation to the complete tumor volume. Representative tumor sections were taken, encompassing macroscopically different tumor areas, including necrosis. As a general rule, one section per centimeter largest diameter with a minimum of three was taken. On the basis of an integration of gross and microscopic findings, a final estimate of the percentages of viable and necrotic or regressive tumor was made.
Excision margins were also evaluated on pathological examination and classified as radical when the resection margins were free of tumor cells (complete resection, R0), as R1 when resection margins were microscopically involved, or as R2 when resection margins were macroscopically positive involved. Postoperative radiotherapy (60–70 Gy) was considered indicated in case of < 95% necrosis on pathological examination of the tumor or with marginal or microscopically positive resection margins. All patients were followed after perfusion treatment in a standardized protocol. Median follow-up was 27 (range 2–138) months.

DISCUSSION
15
 ILP with TNF-α is currently available in more than 30 centers, and in 2002, a total of 350 so-called TNF-α perfusions were performed. As one of the first centers that participated in the TNF-α ILP experience, and with more than a decade’s experience, we recently encountered long-term treatment-related morbidity necessitating amputation of the perfused limb 10 years after treatment. For this reason, we analyzed our results of ILP with TNF-α and melphalan and describe our results in the present study.

We used the Kaplan-Meier method to calculate limb salvage because this method adjusts for censored observations, i.e., patients who were alive and well at the time of last contact or patients who died of distant metastases but who retained preserved limb function. By use of this method, we calculated a 1-year limb salvage rate of 80%. Amputations were performed mostly because of postperfusion-related complications or early local recurrence in the first year after ILP. A second curve in limb salvage was observed within 5 years after TNF-α ILP in two patients with late local recurrences. A third bend in the limb salvage curve was observed approximately 10 years after ILP. This was a new observation in two patients who had critical leg ischemia with ulceration and continuous pain. Besides ILP with TNF-α and melphalan, both patients received adjuvant radiotherapy (66 and 70 Gy) after marginal tumor resection.
27
28
 The fact that in our series no muscle atrophy or fibrosis was found might be explained by the fact that we always perform a lateral fasciotomy after ILP to prevent a compartment syndrome. When we performed a literature search for late morbidity after ILP with TNF-α and melphalan, no studies could be retrieved.

 described 12 fractures of the femur after surgery and irradiation for STS of the thigh. Treatment of these fractures was difficult and demanding, with only four bony unions after a mean follow-up of 37 months. When we add up the evidence of developing fibrosis after ILP with melphalan and the development of fibrosis after radiotherapy, the combination of the two regimens could explain the observed late morbidity rate in the present series.
23
24
35
36
37
 However, systemic therapy is associated with systemic toxic effects, in contrast with the mild systemic side effects observed after ILP with TNF-α and melphalan.
Since 1992, we have not changed the indication for TNF-α perfusion. Patients who were candidates for amputation of the involved limb, as assessed by preoperative magnetic resonance imaging, were offered an ILP with TNF-α and melphalan, with the goal of preserving the limb with a locally advanced STS. After ILP patients received a delayed surgical resection, adjuvant radiotherapy was provided to patients with marginal or microscopically positive resection margins. This treatment resulted in a high limb salvage rate in patients with locally advanced STS, although late morbidity can occur, especially when adjuvant postoperative radiotherapy is applied. Therefore, continuous follow-up of these patients is warranted.
