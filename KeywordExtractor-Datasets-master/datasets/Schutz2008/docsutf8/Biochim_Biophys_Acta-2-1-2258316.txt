Abstract
in vitro
 and in CHO cells when both proteins are expressed exogenously. In CHO cells, we have also demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation that Syk binds to tau. Finally, by site-directed mutagenesis substituting the tyrosine residues of tau with phenylalanine, we established that tyrosine 18 was the primary residue in tau phosphorylated by Syk. The identification of Syk as a common tyrosine kinase of both tau and α-synuclein may be of potential significance in neurodegenerative disorders and also in neuronal physiology. These results bring another clue to the intriguing overlaps between tauopathies and synucleinopathies and provide new insights into the role of Syk in neuronal physiology.

). In the presence of Syk, an additional band of approximately 70 kDa, migrating just above tau, was observed on the phosphotyrosine immunoblot. This band is likely to contain Syk since the kinase is known to autophosphorylate. Taken together, these results demonstrate that Syk can directly catalyze tau phosphorylation.

. Syk binds to and phosphorylates both tau and synuclein, suggesting that this kinase could be a link between synucleinopathies and tauopathies. In conclusion, our findings significantly contribute to the understanding of the signaling pathways involving tyrosine phosphorylation of tau in both physiological and pathological conditions. Further elucidation of the functional relationship between tau and the Syk in neurons could provide critical insights into the role of tau in cell signaling as well as the role of tau in neurodegenerative processes.

Control tau was put through the same procedure but without kinase. The phosphorylation reactions were analyzed by Western blotting using 8% gels and P-Tyr-100 (Blot P-Tyr) and tau-5 (Blot Tau). The data presented are representative of three independent experiments.

Phosphorylation of tau by Syk in cells. (A) CHO cells were co-transfected with 2N4R V5 tagged human tau and constructs expressing Syk-GFP (Tau + Syk-GFP), Abl (Tau + Abl) or empty vector (Tau + pEGFP-N2) as described previously. An additional positive control consisted of tau-transfected cells treated with pervanadate (Tau pervanadate). Cells were harvested after 24 h and tau was immunoprecipitated using anti-V5 antibody. Western blots on the immunoprecipitates were probed with P-Tyr-100 (IP V5, Blot P-Tyr) and with Tau-5 (IP V5, Blot Tau) or Syk N-19 (IP V5, Blot Syk) after membrane stripping. (B) CHO cells were transiently co-transfected with 0N3R untagged human tau and native human Syk (Tau 0N3R + Syk) or transfected with 0N3R tau alone (Tau 0N3R). Cells were harvested after 24 h and tau was immunoprecipitated using tau-5 antibody. Western blots on the immunoprecipitates were probed with P-Tyr-100 (IP Tau, Blot P-Tyr) and Tau-5 (IP Tau, Blot Tau). The data presented are representative of three independent experiments and were confirmed by using another phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10, Upstate, data not shown).

The constructs used were based upon tau 2N4R cDNA and were V5-tagged. Cells were harvested after 24 h and tau was immunoprecipitated using anti-V5 antibody. Western blots of the immunoprecipitates were probed with P-Tyr-100 (IPV5, Blot P-Tyr) and Tau-5 (IPV5, Blot Tau).
