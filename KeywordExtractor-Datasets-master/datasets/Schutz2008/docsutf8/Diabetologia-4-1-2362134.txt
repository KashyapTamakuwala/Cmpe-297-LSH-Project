Aims/hypothesis
Our aims were to compare osteoclastic activity between patients with acute Charcot’s osteoarthropathy and diabetic and healthy controls, and to determine the effect of the receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB ligand (RANKL) and its decoy receptor osteoprotegerin (OPG).

Methods
Peripheral blood monocytes isolated from nine diabetic Charcot patients, eight diabetic control and eight healthy control participants were cultured in the presence of macrophage-colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) alone, M-CSF and RANKL, and also M-CSF and RANKL with excess concentrations of OPG. Osteoclast formation was assessed by expression of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase on glass coverslips and resorption on dentine slices.

Conclusions/interpretation
These results indicate that RANKL-mediated osteoclastic resorption occurs in acute Charcot’s osteoarthropathy. However, the incomplete inhibition of RANKL after addition of OPG also suggests the existence of a RANKL-independent pathway.

The aims of this study were: (1) to generate functional human osteoclasts in vitro from diabetic patients with acute Charcot’s osteoarthropathy and from healthy and diabetic control participants; (2) to compare the extent of osteoclast formation and resorption; and (3) to determine the role of the RANK/RANKL/OPG pathway in osteoclastic activity in Charcot’s osteoarthropathy.

 PBMCs were added to 6-mm diameter glass coverslips and 4-mm diameter dentine slices in MEM containing 100 UI/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin and 10% FCS (Gibco, Paisley, UK). After 2 h incubation, coverslips and dentine slices were vigorously rinsed in medium to remove non-adherent cells. The cultures were maintained in MEM/FCS under three different culture conditions: (1) human M-CSF (R&D Systems Europe, Abingdon, UK) alone at 25 ng/ml; (2) M-CSF plus 100 ng/ml human soluble RANKL (sRANKL; Peprotech, London, UK) (a concentration known to facilitate differentiation of osteoclast precursors to active bone-resorbing osteoclasts in vitro); and (3) M-CSF plus sRANKL plus 250 ng/ml human OPG (R&D Systems Europe).

Osteoclast formation
After 14 days, the coverslips were examined histochemically for the expression of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAcP), an osteoclast marker. Coverslips with newly formed osteoclasts were collected and rinsed in PBS buffer, fixed with formalin (10% [vol./vol.] in PBS buffer) for 10 min and rinsed in distilled water. TRAcP was histochemically revealed by a simultaneous coupling reaction using Naphtol AS-BI-phosphate as substrate and Fast violet B as the diazonium salt. The coverslips were incubated for 90 min at 37°C in a dark room, rinsed three times in distilled water and the residual activity was inhibited by 4% NaF (wt/wt) for 30 min. Coverslips were then rinsed in distilled water, counterstained with DAPI for 20 min and allowed to dry before mounting, using an aqueous medium. TRAcP-positive cells with more than three nuclei were identified as osteoclasts. The number of newly generated osteoclasts was assessed using a light microscope examination.

They were then rinsed in distilled water and stained with 0.5% (vol./vol.) toluidine blue prior to examination by light microscopy. The surface of each dentine slice was examined for evidence of lacunar resorption and the extent of eroded surface on each dentine slice was determined using image analysis and expressed as the percentage of surface area resorbed.

Discussion
This study shows that monocytes from patients with acute Charcot’s osteoarthropathy cultured in the presence of M-CSF alone were capable of differentiating into mature osteoclasts that exhibited increased resorption compared with diabetic and healthy control participants. Furthermore, osteoclasts generated after the addition of sRANKL were functionally more aggressive, exhibiting a considerable increase in the extent of resorbing activity in patients with acute Charcot’s osteoarthropathy. This resorption was partially blocked by the addition of excess concentrations of OPG, a soluble receptor decoy for RANKL. This suggests that the increased osteoclastic activity in patients with acute Charcot’s osteoarthropathy is mediated through both a RANKL-dependent and a RANKL-independent pathway.

The concentrations of these circulating factors in diabetic and healthy control participants may not be sufficient to induce the formation and differentiation of active osteoclasts in the presence of M-CSF alone.

]. Overall, the observed extensive resorption in acute Charcot patients, in the presence of M-CSF and sRANKL, as compared with the diabetic or healthy control groups, may suggest that the osteoclast precursors circulating in acute Charcot patients are in a higher activated state and as such are more primed to becoming osteoclasts (mediated through RANKL) than those in the control groups.

]. In acute Charcot’s osteoarthropathy, it is possible that one or a combination of these factors may have initiated the circulating osteoclast precursors to be in a more ‘primed’ condition, a situation which as such could explain the observed resorption in Charcot monocyte cultures supplemented with M-CSF alone, without the exogenous addition of any osteoclastogenic mediators.

], could contribute also to the pathogenesis of the Charcot’s osteoarthropathy.
This study has indicated, for the first time that the RANKL-dependent pathway is important in the pathogenesis of Charcot’s osteoarthropathy, thereby raising the possibility of the use of RANKL inhibition in the management of Charcot’s foot. However, our observations also suggest that a RANKL-independent pathway may play a role, but further investigation is required to fully clarify the mechanism involved. If confirmed, specific pharmacological agents that counteract the RANKL-independent pathway, such as anti-TNF strategies, may be useful in the treatment of Charcot’s osteoarthropathy. Whatever the relative importance of either pathway, this in vitro technique of generating human osteoclasts from PBMCs may allow specific characterisation of osteoclastic activity in each patient and could, in the future, lead to individually tailored anti-osteoclastic treatment for the patient with acute Charcot’s osteoarthropathy.
