Endovascular closure of high-flow arteriovenous (AV) shunts in intracranial AV malformations or pial fistulas is technically challenging. In this paper, we illustrate two simple methods to occlude large high-flow AV shunts in a controlled manner.

]. With the use of liquid embolic agents, the high flow through the shunt may cause migration of the embolic agent to the venous outflow tract with possible devastating consequences. In anatomical configurations with a very short arterial feeder, the shunt can only be occluded at the venous side. In this paper, we illustrate two simple methods to occlude large AV shunts in a controlled manner applied in three patients.

]. However, simple Onyx injection is not always feasible: in some very high-flow shunts Onyx may migrate through the fistula into the distal draining veins. We found the adjuvant use of a microballoon to block the flow to enable gradual occlusion of the large high-flow shunts with Onyx in the AVM of patient 1 a very useful approach.
In the other patients, one with a very short arterial feeder of an AV shunt in an AVM and one with a side-wall pial fistula, the use of liquid embolic agents was not possible and controlled delivery of detachable coils to the venous side of the shunt was technically easy with complete occlusion of the fistula. This technique is helpful in shunts with a moderately dilated venous outflow tract in which placement of coils is possible.
In conclusion, different types of high-flow AV shunts can safely be occluded with endovascular techniques tailored to the specific anatomical configuration of the shunt.
