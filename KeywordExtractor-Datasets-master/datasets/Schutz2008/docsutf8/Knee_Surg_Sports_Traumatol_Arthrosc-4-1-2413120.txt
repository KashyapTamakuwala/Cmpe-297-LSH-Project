U
 test shows a significant difference in favor of the automated pump for the presence of turbidity only (Exact Sig. [2*(1-tailed Sig.)] = 0.015). Otherwise, no differences were determined (Exact Sig. [2*(1-tailed Sig.)] > 0.436). A new objective method is successfully applied to assess efficiency of pump systems based on the quality of the arthroscopic view. Important disturbances (bleeding, air bubbles, and loose fibrous tissue) are not reduced by an automated pump used in combination with a tourniquet. The most frequent disturbance turbidity is reduced by around 50%. It is questionable if this result justifies the use of an automated pump for straightforward arthroscopic knee surgeries using a tourniquet.

]. The matching criteria were the number of operations, the duration of the operations, the duration of shaver usage, the type of operation, and the working experience of the surgeons. Matching of the shaver duration was performed, because some disturbances were expected to occur more frequently when using the shaver. Besides, a shaver is often used to clarify the view by temporarily increasing the flow. All surgeons who performed the operations had the same education and comparable working experience.

). The results show that for routinely performed arthroscopic knee operations, the automated pump was significantly more effective in reducing the presence of turbidity with 50% on average. This finding can be explained by the continuous flow of 90 ml/min that is activated by the automated pump as opposed to the lower flow cause by leakage along the portals when using the gravity pump and a two-portal technique. No difference was determined for the other three disturbances. The low percentage of bleeding can be attributed to the use of a tourniquet in all operations. In order to determine the effectiveness of pump systems for this disturbance, analysis of shoulder surgeries would be more convenient.
The found variation in the duration of disturbances per operation could have been caused by the condition of the knee joints, because this factor could not be completely eliminated with precise matching. With this knowledge, a future suggestion is to analyze a larger number of patients per pump group to determine possibly other significant differences in pump performance.
Comparison of the operation phases independently showed similar results for the inspection phase compared to the total operation time, probably because this was the longest phase. Since the creation of portals was a relatively short phase, and the use of punches was absent for almost half of the operations, no significant differences were found. However, analysis of both groups internally showed that the presence of loose fibrous tissue was generally significantly higher in when an instrument was used (Phases 3 and 4). This is in accordance with the general expectation and confirms the applicability of this method for quantification of disturbances in the view.
Concluding, this study shows that important disturbances as bleeding, air bubbles, and loose fibrous tissue are not affected by a pump system when performing a routine knee arthroscopy with a tourniquet. The most frequent disturbance turbidity is reduced by around 50% when using an automated pump. It is questionable if this justifies the use of an automated pump for straightforward arthroscopic knee surgeries using a tourniquet, since the purchase of an automated pump is more costly.
