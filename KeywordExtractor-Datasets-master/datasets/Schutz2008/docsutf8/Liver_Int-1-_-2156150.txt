Aims
To compare interferon monotherapy with its combination with lamivudine for hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive hepatitis B treatment.

Methods
Two independent researchers identified pertinent randomized controlled trials. The trials were evaluated for methodological quality and heterogeneity. Rates of sustained virological and biochemical responses, and HBeAg clearance and seroconversion were used as primary efficacy measures. Quantitative meta-analyses were conducted to assess differences between groups for conventional and pegylated interferon, and overall.

Conclusion
In comparable populations, pegylated interferon monotherapy is likely to be equally or more efficacious than conventional interferon and lamivudine combination therapy, thus constituting the treatment of choice, with no added benefit with lamivudine addition. However, when conventional interferon is used, its combination with lamivudine should be considered.

). In our study, we aim to elucidate this topic comparing interferon monotherapy to its combination with the best-studied antiviral agent for that purpose, lamivudine. Furthermore, the focus of our analysis is hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive patients, a subset of the patient population in which disease activity, risk of complications and the subsequent need of efficacious therapy are more pronounced.
Methods
Literature search and study design
Two independent researchers conducted the literature search, study selection and data extraction, with any disagreements resolved by consensus among them.
The researchers conducted a systemic literature search using the electronic databases MEDLINE (1966 to January 2006), EMBASE (1980 to June 2006), OVID (1966 to January, week 3, 2006) and the Cochrane library clinical trials registry (issue 1, 2007). The following keywords were used: ‘Hepatitis B’, ‘Interferon’, ‘Lamivudine’ and ‘combination therapy’. In addition, a manual search using citations in previous publications was preformed. The following inclusion criteria were used: (i) study design: randomized controlled trials; (ii) study population: HBeAg-positive patients; (iii) intervention: interferon vs. interferon and lamivudine therapy. Our search was not restricted by language. The following exclusion criteria were used: (i) examining the nonadult population; (ii) not reporting any of the primary efficacy measures as defined by the authors. When several publications pertaining to a single study were identified, the most recent and complete publication was used.
The included studies were divided into two groups according to their use of conventional (CON) or pegylated (PEG) interferon-α, with patients within each group given interferon monotherapy, or interferon and lamivudine combination therapy. Data were extracted for study methodology and for the defined efficacy measures. Only data pertaining to the regimens in question were extracted, while data concerning other regimens were reviewed, and if found to be of significance to our study, were noted and discussed. Separate meta-analyses examining the defined efficacy measures were preformed. In addition, we compared the rates of sustained responses across groups aiming at the identification of a preferable regimen. Intention to treat analysis was used throughout this study, excluding histological response analysis, because of its low outcomes reporting rates.

Efficacy measures and definitions

). Biochemical response was defined as normalization of alanine aminotransferase levels, HBeAg clearance as HBeAg disappearance and seroconversion as HBeAg antibodies appearance. Histological response was defined as a two-point reduction or increase in the histologic activity index score, signifying histological improvement and worsening respectively. Treatment safety was assessed using the occurrence rate of adverse effects necessitating treatment discontinuation.

). In our study, we explored this notion in the subset of HBeAg-positive patients. Our study is the first to examine the combination of interferon and lamivudine for chronic hepatitis B treatment, pooling data from all pertinent randomized-controlled trials into meta-analysis. This analysis will aid in achieving evidence-based conclusions on the matter, resolving the controversy in its regard and directing future investigational efforts.

).
Our study contains several limitations. Firstly, our use of intention to treat analysis, the methodological heterogeneity of the included studies, and the heterogeneity of their treatment and follow-up protocols, may have introduced some inaccuracies in our analysis. Notably, while the PEG group comprised large, carefully planned, well-executed studies, the CON group involved smaller, lower quality ones, thus weakening our conclusions in its regard. Secondly, the absence of adequate controls precluded the authors from studying the subsets of treatment-naïve and previously treated populations. Those concerns, however, were alleviated by the low patient lost for follow-up rates, the lack of statistically significant heterogeneity across studies, the beneficial effects of the combination with conventional interferon across the measured indicators and the agreement between our conclusions and those of other studies.

). Those results indicate the need for further study, as the goal of a safe and efficacious therapy is yet to be attained.

Conclusion
Pegylated interferon-α monotherapy is the treatment of choice for HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B, with no added benefit with lamivudine addition. However, when conventional interferon therapy is considered, its combination with lamivudine should be entertained.
