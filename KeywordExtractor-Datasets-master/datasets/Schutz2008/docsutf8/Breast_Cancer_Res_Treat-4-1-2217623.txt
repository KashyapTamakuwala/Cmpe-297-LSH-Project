Background
PvuII
XbaI
 polymorphisms, which have been associated to lower sensitivity to estrogen. We evaluated whether these polymorphisms were associated with breast cancer risk by means of an association study in a population of Caucasian postmenopausal women from the Rotterdam study and a meta-analysis of published data.

Methods
PvuII
XbaI
 polymorphisms were genotyped in 3,893 women participants of the Rotterdam Study. Baseline information was obtained through a questionnaire. We conducted logistic regression analyses to assess the risk of breast cancer by each of the ESR1 genotypes. Meta-analyses of all publications on these relations were done by retrieving literature from Pubmed and by further checking the reference lists of the articles obtained.

Results

 genotypes neither in overall, incident or prevalent cases. No further evidence of a role of these variants was found in the meta-analysis.

Conclusions
Our results suggest that the ESR1 polymorphisms do not play a role in breast cancer risk in Caucasian postmenopausal women.

The aim of our study was to evaluate the effect of these polymorphisms on breast cancer risk by performing an association analysis in a population based study of Caucasian postmenopausal women. Further, we performed meta-analyses of all available published data on these polymorphisms and the risk of breast cancer.

Case identification and validation
Three different databases were used for patient identification. First, cases diagnosed by general practitioners in the research area (Ommoord) were collected (International Classification of Primary Care (code X76)). Second, the Dutch National Registry of all hospital admissions (LMR) was consulted to detect all malignancy related hospital admissions for study participants. Finally, regional pathology databases were linked to the Rotterdam Study to identify patients. Subsequently, breast cancer cases were validated by a physician on the basis of medical records of the general practitioner, discharge letters and pathology reports. Only pathologically confirmed cases were considered in the analysis. The index date was defined as the earliest date found in the pathology report.

One of the limitations of our study is the limited number of breast cancer cases present in our population. Nevertheless, we have sufficient power (β = 0.8) to detect effects of 1.6 or higher. We further conducted meta-analyses off all studies conducted to date. Our data suggests that these two polymorphisms do not play a role in the susceptibility of breast cancer in elderly Caucasian women.
