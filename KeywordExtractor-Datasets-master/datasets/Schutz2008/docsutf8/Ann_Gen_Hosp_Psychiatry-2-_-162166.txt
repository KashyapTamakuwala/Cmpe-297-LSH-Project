Background
th 
cranial nerve up to the cortical auditory centers as a result of external auditory stimuli. Central Auditory Processing Disorders may co-exist with mental disorders and complicate diagnosis and outcome.

Design
A MEDLINE search was conducted to search for papers concerning the association between Central Auditory Processing Disorders and mental disorders. The research focused on the diagnostic methods providing the inter-connection of various mental disorders and central auditory deficits.

Measurements and Main Results
The medline research revealed 564 papers when using the keywords 'auditory deficits' and 'mental disorders'. 79 papers were referring specifically to Central Auditory Processing Disorders in connection with mental disorders. 175 papers were related to Schizophrenia, 126 to learning disabilities, 29 to Parkinson's disease, 88 to dyslexia and 39 to Alzheimer's disease. Assessment of the Central Auditory System is carried out through a great variety of tests that fall into two main categories: psychoacoustic and electrophysiologic testing. Different specialties are involved in the diagnosis and management of Central Auditory Processing Disorders as well as the mental disorders that may co-exist with them. As a result it is essential that they are all aware of the possibilities in diagnostic procedures.

Conclusions
Considerable evidence exists that mental disorders may correlate with CAPD and this correlation could be revealed through psychoacoustics and neuroaudiology. Mental disorders that relate to Central Auditory Processing Disorders are: Schizophrenia, attention deficit disorders, Alzheimer's disease, learning disabilities, dyslexia, depression, auditory hallucinations, Parkinson's disease, alcoholism, anorexia and childhood mental retardation. Clinical awareness should be high in order for doctors of the two specialties, psychiatry and otorhinolaryngology-audiology to collaborate.

Anatomy and physiology of the CANS
Clinical evaluation of central auditory function requires understanding of the anatomy and physiology of the CANS and appreciation of its complexity. The CANS extends from the anterior and posterior cochlear nuclei which are situated on the surface of the inferior cerebellar peduncle to the auditory cortex. In between important structures through which nerve fibers pass are: the trapezoid body, the lateral lemniscus, the inferior colliculus, the medial geniculate body and the acoustic radiation of the internal capsule. The auditory cortex includes the gyrus of Heschl on the upper surface of the superior temporal gyrus, the planum temporale and the Silvian fissure.

]. Many components of the stimulus are analyzed separately. There is an increasing complexity of the whole process in the auditory cortex. One should keep in mind that, understanding of the exact way of processing the auditory information at the level of the auditory cortex, is still incomplete. It is in this understanding that Phychoacoustics helps as it is the science concerned with the evaluation of the sensation of hearing as an outcome of the sound or speech stimulus.

]. It is due to this component that someone can listen to another person talking in a railway station, where a lot of environmental noise exists.


Material and methods
The medline research revealed 564 papers when using the keywords 'auditory deficits' and 'mental disorders'. 79 papers were referring specifically to CAPD in connection with mental disorders, as this is a new term for auditory deficits and one mostly used by audiologists. Auditory deficit is a more general term used mostly by psychiatrists. Both terms refer to the same disorder. It is essential to point out that 25 of the 79 papers are published between 2000 – 2003.
Schizophrenia is found related to CAPD in 175 papers, 49 of them are published between 2000 – 2003 showing the research focus of the last three years. Learning disabilities were found related to CAPD in 126 papers. Parkinson's disease was related to CAPD in 29 papers. Dyslexia is related to CAPD in 88 papers, 37 of them are between 2000–2003. Alzheimer's disease and auditory deficits are connected in 39 papers. The remaining articles are on depression, alcoholism, anorexia and childhood mental retardation, all being related to some extend to CAPD.
Assessment of the CANS is carried through a great variety of tests that fall into two main categories: psychoacoustic and electrophysiologic testing. Psychoacoustic tests are considered more subjective. Electrophysiologic ones are more objective with the exception of P300 component.

Conclusions
CANS assessment represents a fascinating field. Cooperation of professionals in psychiatry, neurology, neuropsychology and pediatric psychology, with the otolaryngologist-audiologist is a prerequisite. Central auditory processing disorders may co-exist with various mental disorders such as: learning disabilities, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, dyslexia, autism, chronic alcoholism, Alzheimer's disease, adult autistic disorder, Schizophrenia, anorexia and mental retardation. Assessing these disorders is difficult due to the complex anatomy and physiology of the CANS. This explains the great variety of existing methods of testing with two main categories: those of psychoacoustic methodology and those based on electrophysiologic measures. Physiology of CANS is still not completely understood and further research is needed on development of new tests and validation of their clinical applicability.
