The WAIS III was administered to 16 adults with high functioning autism (HFA) and 27 adults with Asperger syndrome. Differences between Verbal Intelligence (VIQ) and Performance Intelligence (PIQ) were not found. Processing Speed problems in people with HFA appeared. At the subtest level, the Asperger syndrome group performed weak on Digit Span. Comprehension and Block Design were relative strengths. In the HFA group, performance on Digit-Symbol Coding and Symbol Search was relatively poor. Strengths were found on Information and Matrix Reasoning. The results suggest that the VIQ-PIQ difference cannot distinguish between HFA and Asperger syndrome. WAIS III Factor Scale and Subtest patterning provides a more valid indicator.

Introduction

).
In WAIS III, the intelligence pattern is described at three levels: The first level contains Performance Intelligence and Verbal Intelligence. The second level consists of the four factor scales: Verbal Comprehension, Perceptual Organization, Freedom from Distractibility and Processing Speed. The third level contains the subtests. The following paragraphs summarizes research on the intelligence profiles of adults with the autistic disorder or Asperger syndrome on the basis of these three levels.

No studies have been performed on WAIS-III profiles for adults with HFA or Asperger syndrome as far as we know. Therefore no information is available on the results of factor scales in these groups. This leads to the conclusion that the most important factors of the intelligence pattern for adults with HFA or Asperger syndrome are still unknown.

).
In summary, research shows that among adults with HFA or Asperger syndrome, results of VIQ-PIQ differences vary and may be influenced by the validity problems of the VIQ-PIQ dichotomy. The factor scale scores and the subtest patterns provide a better representation of the intelligence pattern.
Aims of the Present Study
The present study aims to acquire insight into the WAIS III profiles of normal intelligent adults with HFA and Asperger syndrome. Profiles in the total group and differences between the two diagnostic groups will be examined.


Methods
Procedure
All participants were recruited from the GGZ (Mental Health Center) Eindhoven and Oost-Brabant. The participants met the criteria for Asperger syndrome or HFA. Participants with relevant neurodevelopmental conditions and genetic conditions were excluded, as were institutionalized patients and patients with a Full Scale IQ below 80.

All individuals ranged in age from 18 to 60 years. The mean age was 41.93. Of all participants, 25 finished higher education and 30 individuals had work. 23 participants lived together with a partner. The relatively large number of participants who had a relationship, worked and were well educated emphasizes the relatively high level of functioning in this group.

Results
Analyses were done at the three WAIS-III levels: VIQ versus PIQ, the four factor scales and all subtests. Preliminary analysis included checks for normality, linearity, influential data points and assumptions of repeated measures. No serious deviations were found. T-tests showed that both diagnosis groups were comparable in education and work status, as well as in gender distribution.

). In order to maintain an overview of what they are doing, they work slowly.

WAIS III Subtest Level
Analyses showed different Subtest patterns in the HFA and the Asperger syndrome groups. The HFA group performed significantly low in Digit-Symbol Coding and Symbol Search. These two subtests together form the Processing Speed Factor. The low scores for these subtests represent the problems in speed of processing visual information as described in the preceding paragraph.

Conclusions
The present study found people with Asperger syndrome to differ significantly from people with HFA in WAIS III Factor Scale profiles and WAIS III Subtest patterning. In people with HFA Processing Speed problems were found. Further, the HFA and Asperger syndrome group showed different subtest patterns. The present study supports the idea that HFA and Asperger syndrome can be differentiated empirically at the level of intellectual functioning. This lends support to the hypothesis that HFA and the Asperger syndrome are two separate disorders.
