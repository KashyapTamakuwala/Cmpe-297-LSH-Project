Alterations in mass transport patterns of low-density lipoproteins (LDL) and oxygen are known to cause atherosclerosis in larger arteries. We hypothesise that the species transport processes in coronary arteries may be affected by their physiological motion, a factor which has not been considered widely in mass transfer studies. Hence, we numerically simulated the mass transport of LDL and oxygen in an idealized moving coronary artery model under both steady and pulsatile flow conditions. A physiological inlet velocity and a sinusoidal curvature waveform were specified as velocity and wall motion boundary conditions. The results predicted elevation of LDL flux, impaired oxygen flux and low wall shear stress (WSS) along the inner wall of curvature, a predilection site for atherosclerosis. The wall motion induced changes in the velocity and WSS patterns were only secondary to the pulsatile flow effects. The temporal variations in flow and WSS due to the flow pulsation and wall motion did not affect temporal changes in the species wall flux. However, the wall motion did alter the time-averaged oxygen and LDL flux in the order of 26% and 12% respectively. Taken together, these results suggest that the wall motion may play an important role in coronary arterial transport processes and emphasise the need for further investigation.

 Even in that study only the effects of diameter variation (<6% of mean diameter) on oxygen transport was considered.

 Computer aided design (CAD) models of the LAD were employed in this study as opposed to realistic geometries to simplify the complexity of the problem definition, solution and analysis of results so as to gain a fundamental understanding of the haemodynamic effects of wall motion in coronary arteries. The species of interest in this study were low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and oxygen.

The tube inlet was fixed constant in the simulations at all times. This allowed the centre of curvature to vary sinusoidally in a cardiac cycle.

Temporal axial inner and outer WSS distribution at 5 diameters (top panel) and 9 diameters (bottom panel) from the LAD inlet.




The pulsatility of blood flow caused time varying WSS distribution along the outer and inner walls. The WSS increased with the pulsatile flow rate and overall this increase was greater along the outer wall. Hence peak WSS was noted along the outer wall at maximum flow rate. Together, wall motion and flow pulsatility produced instantaneous variations in the outer and inner WSS which were somewhat similar to the WSS distribution in the pulsatile flow static model. Although the gross distribution of WSS primarily followed the flow rate curve, the dynamic curvature effects were evident in the central section where the location and magnitude of peak WSS were different from that of the pulsatile flow static model.

Figure 6.
Time-averaged axial WSS distribution along the inner and outer walls of the LAD.




The combined effects of wall motion and pulsatility caused an increase in the outer WSS up to its peak value and a subsequent decrease in the WSS in comparison with that of the pulsatile flow static model, and an overall increase in the outer WSS when compared to the steady flow models. Along the inner wall the flow pulsatility and the wall motion produced contrasting effects whereby the former decreased the WSS and the later increased the WSS. Due to this opposing effect of wall motion and flow pulsatility their combination had only caused smaller variations in the WSS distribution.

Along the outer wall after an initial sharp drop the flow pulsation caused a gradual increase and then a gradual decrease in the oxygen flux. The wall motion produced a net reduction in the oxygen flux to the outer wall from the inlet. When both the wall motion and flow pulsatility were included the oxygen flux decreased sharply closer to the inlet followed by a gradual increase in the medial region and a gradual decrease thereafter. Nevertheless, in all the models the time-averaged outer wall oxygen flux was more than that to the inner wall.

 which may exacerbate or reduce the effects of wall motion on haemodynamics and species transport. While we accept that the neglect of complex geometry may introduce some simplifications in the results it should be recognised that the geometric simplification enabled us to isolate the effects of geometry and to concentrate on the role of wall motion on species transport.
The results predicted in this study are specific to the flow and wall motion used in our model and therefore would be expected to change if a different flow or wall motion were imposed. For instance, if the flow and wall motion were more out of phase it may be expected that this would reduce the instantaneous Dean number and therefore one might expect the impact of the dynamic wall motion to be decreased from what was predicted. Although the wall motion effects were secondary to the pulsatile flow effects this does not mean that the wall motion is unimportant. Given the considerable variability in coronary artery motion, geometry and flow patterns in vivo there may be instances where wall motion could play a more significant role and therefore its effects should be considered on a case by case basis.
6
 In regions of high WSS, the effective diffusivities of LDL and oxygen would increase. This would in turn enhance oxygen wall flux but reduce LDL wall flux due to LDL concentration polarisation. Therefore, the magnitude of LDL and oxygen wall fluxes predicted in our study would be expected to change but the general patterns of flux will remain the same.

Conclusion
In this study, we have incorporated the effects of idealised motion into a simulation of oxygen and LDL transport in the LAD. The LDL and oxygen transport were modelled differently due to their differences in in-vivo transport mechanisms. We carried out simulations under both the steady and pulsatile flow conditions in the static and dynamic models to quantify the relative importance of pulsatility and wall motion on mass transport patterns. This study showed that the effects of wall motion on mass transport in the coronary arteries could be modelled in the commercial CFD code Fluent.
Our results predicted elevation of LDL flux, impaired oxygen flux and low wall shear stress (WSS) along the inner wall of curvature, a region known for its predilection to atherosclerosis. The temporal variations in velocity and WSS patterns in the dynamic model did not influence time dependent mass transport and were only secondary to the pulsatile flow effects. However, wall motion may influence mass transport if shear dependent variations in species permeability and other factors are considered in the calculations. Nevertheless, the wall motion did alter the time-averaged mass transfer in the medial and distal regions in the order of 26% and 12% for oxygen and LDL transport when compared to the corresponding static models. Taken together, these results suggest that wall motion may play an important role in coronary arterial transport processes. However, future studies on more physiologic models are warranted to gain a fundamental understanding of the role of wall motion on mass transport and atherosclerosis.
