The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a key organelle of the secretion pathway involved in the synthesis of both proteins and lipids destined for multiple sites within and without the cell. The ER functions to both co- and post-translationally modify newly synthesized proteins and lipids and sort them for housekeeping within the ER and for transport to their sites of function away from the ER. In addition, the ER is involved in the metabolism and degradation of specific xenobiotics and endogenous biosynthetic products. A variety of proteomics studies have been reported on different subcompartments of the ER providing an ER protein dictionary with new data being made available on many protein complexes of relevance to the biology of the ER including the ribosome, the translocon, coatomer proteins, cytoskeletal proteins, folding proteins, the antigen-processing machinery, signaling proteins and proteins involved in membrane traffic. This review examines proteomics and cytological data in support of the presence of specific molecular machines at specific sites or subcompartments of the ER.

Protein synthesis and secretion
The ER is a key organelle of the secretion pathway involved in the synthesis of both proteins and lipids destined for multiple sites within and without the cell.

Biosynthetic cargo

). Although transmembrane proteins destined for transport out of the ER to the Golgi Apparatus and to the plasma membrane are expected to be part of the biosynthetic cargo of the ER such proteins maybe either too low in abundance for detection by mass spectrometry or they could be considered as membrane contaminants of the ER preparations. Confirmation of the latter suggestion would require double labeling for specific membrane markers using imunocytochemistry of the subcellular fractions used for proteomics analysis.

Proteins involved in cargo exit and membrane traffic

). Therefore even though organelle proteomics studies may often suggest the presence of organelle contaminants using intuitive reasoning and corollary experiments as was done by Michel Desjardins and colleagues, in the case of ER proteins associated with phagosomes such studies may also provide information leading to new paradigms.

Cytoskeletal proteins

2006

). Therefore filamin A may bind yet unidentified nascent receptors in the ER in hepatocytes and promote traffic of these molecules to the cell surface.

2006

). Perhaps the tubular structure of the ER favors ER/motor/microtubule interaction? However if reticulons promote long unbranched ER tubules, how do they affect tritubular jonctions as observed in the large inter-connecting networks of tubules in sER in steroid cells or in hepatocytes?

Phosphoproteins associated with the ER

Conclusions and future perspectives
From available proteomics data parts of which are supported by electron microscope protein localization studies some tentative conclusions can be drawn about the relative segregation of proteins and molecular machines in the subcompartments of the ER. CLIMP-63 and ribosomes are enriched in rER. Reticulon, enzymes involved in ubiquitination, the proteasome, some cytoskeletal proteins, proteins involved in antigen processing, and coat proteins are enriched in sER. In contrast, proteins that appear equally distributed between rER and sER include proteins of the translocon, biosynthetic cargo, chaperones, proteins of detoxification, and proteins involved in lipid and glucose metabolism.
Because proteomics of ER subcompartments is carried out using subcellular fractions, there are limitations that have to be considered when trying to interpret the results of the protein analysis. For example, the relative purity of the fractions will vary and proteins of fragments of contaminating organelles will be present in the fraction and be identified in the analysis. Moreover molecular dynamics at the cytosolic and luminal surfaces of the ER have to be taken into consideration. The composition of the ER is subject to change based on molecular interactions occurring on both cytosolic and luminal sides of the ER membrane. On the cytosolic side of the ER interaction with the cytoskeleton (to change the location, shape or size of the ER) or interaction with signaling proteins (to activate specific signaling pathways, e.g., apoptosis) leads to transient associations between the ER and cytosolic proteins. On the luminal side of the ER interactions between newly synthesized proteins and chaperones can vary under specific conditions (for example during ER stress) and will affect the overall molecular composition. Up-regulation of proteins involved in detoxification may occur under exposure to toxic chemicals and affect ER composition. Thus depending on the cell physiology protein associations with the ER may vary. Dynamics of protein interactions in organelles are often controlled by posttranslational modifications including phosphorylation. Understanding such modifications is key to understanding site-specific protein function.
Proteomics studies of the subcompartments of the ER have lead to insights into the function of the different compartments of this organelle and new paradigms. However data obtained using proteomics analysis should be complimented by cytological techniques to confirm the localization of the proteins in the ER subcompartments and molecular biology should be used to modulate protein expression to examine the function. The combination of these approaches not only will yield new information about the proteins but they will also expand knowledge on the protein families to which they belong and/or protein complexes of which they are part of.
