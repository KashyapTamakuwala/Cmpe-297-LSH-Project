Contrarily to the traditional view in which only one or a few key genes were supposed to be the causative factors of diseases, we discuss the importance 
				of considering groups of functionally related genes in the study of pathologies characterised by chromosomal copy number alterations. Recent observations have 
				reported the existence of regions in higher eukaryotic chromosomes (including humans) containing genes of related function that show a high degree of coregulation. Copy number 
				alterations will consequently affect to clusters of functionally related genes, which will be the final causative agents of the diseased phenotype, in many cases. 
				Therefore, we propose that the functional profiling of the regions affected by copy number alterations must be an important aspect to take into account in the understanding 
				of this type of pathologies. To illustrate this, we present an integrated study of DNA copy number variations, gene expression along with the functional profiling of chromosomal 
				regions in a case of multiple myeloma.

Methodology
Functional profiling of Array-CGH experiments under this new perspective would require of three steps: 1) detection of regions with copy number variations (the
origin of the disease), 2) detection of regional alterations in gene expression (the causes of the disease) and 3) analysis of enrichment in functional terms in the detected
regions (the consequences of the alteration or the functional basis of the disease). While copy number alterations can be detected by means of different
methods, alterations in the levels of gene expression are not always easy to be detected using the typical methods (t-test or similar) due several factors such as small
sample sizes. For this reason here we will only use plots to visualize the effect of one variable (copy number) into the other one (expression level). The third step, the functional profiling, becomes then the most important
aspect of the analysis given that it will provide a functional explanation of the molecular basis of the disease caused by copy number alterations.
Detection of copy number alterations

], for copy number change detection (isowindow).
The isowindow method tries to identify boundaries between regions with a significant change in the values of intensity of hybridisation of the probes by some
consecutive steps. Firstly a t-test is used to determine differences between regions around all possible boundary points. Once all the candidate boundaries have
been selected (a liberal p-value is used at this stage) there are sorted from small to high minimum p-values. In a second step the boundary candidates in the list with
overlapping neighbourhoods are filtered to obtain a refined list of optimal non-overlapping boundary candidates. All the p-values are recalculated for the
redefined neighbourhoods and a more stringent threshold is applied here. Finally, regions at both sides of each boundary candidate are again compared with a t-test. If
they are not significantly different in their average hybridisation values, then they are merged as a unique region. Otherwise they define two regions with different
copy number value. This is a simple and quick procedure that allows for easily changing from fine to coarse resolution by modifying the thresholds for the p-values.

In the GLAD method a likelihood function with weights determined adaptively is used to solve the copy number estimation problem locally based
on data smoothed. Then, the algorithm finds, for each probe, the maximal neighbourhood in which the local constant assumption holds. Each of the constant pieces
of the line define a block of probes with similar copy number among them and different copy number from that of the nearby regions. On the other hand, the CBS
method selects firstly a segment of the data (a group of probes that are all consecutively arranged in the genome or in a chromosome). The copy number measures of the
probes in that segment are compared to those in the reminder dataset using a t-statistic. Hence, the method can distinguish whether the segment chosen has a copy
number that is higher or lower than the overall copy number in the data, assumed to be the normal reference. This scheme is iterated exhaustively for all possible
segments in the dataset, spotting those that correspond to regions of altered copy number.
An approximation to the relative performances of the methods used was obtained by means of simulated data sets. Such datasets were generated by means of a
piecewise constant function plus random alterations normally distributed with mean value and three different levels for the standard deviation (corresponding to noise
levels 0.2, 0.5 and 1). A mean value of 0 would correspond to a normal region, without copy number alterations, while mean values lower and higher would
correspond to deletions or amplifications at different degrees, respectively. Amplified and deleted regions of different sizes are randomly situated within the simulated
normal chromosome and the methods have to locate them at different noise levels. The method proposed here performs at least as well as the GLAD and CBS (Table
1) while being more efficient in terms of runtimes. Isowindow shows a better performance in finding small amplicons.

] and the resulting data were transformed to log2 ratios. Our purpose was to identify
any possible region that contained copy number gains (amplifications), to study the expression of the genes included in that particular region and to understand the
possible functional consequences of such alterations.
Using the segmentation method as implemented in the ISACGH we could detect a putative amplicon in the chromosome 18 (which remained undetected with both
GLAD and CBS, because of the low density of the array, although the effect would have been the same in a high density arrays with a small amplicon) The figure shows

] GEPAS, that stands for Gene Expression Profile Analysis Suite
(GEPAS), constitutes one of the most complete resources for microarray data analysis available over the web. GEPAS includes facilities for normalisations, clustering,
gene selection, predictors and functional profiling. Thus, different operations (including pre-processing or normalization) can directly be performed within the
same environment, without the necessity of any file reformatting step.

This fact reduces the validity to the classical vision, in which one or a few key genes would be the causative factors of the disease, and urges to take into
consideration the functional dimension in the interpretation of the effects of copy number alterations. In this new scenario, the deregulation of blocks of
functionally related genes located in the chromosomal regions with copy number alterations would be behind the disease phenotype.
The methods for functional profiling have proven in many scenarios its usefulness. An obvious challenge is to increase our knowledge in different aspects of function
and cooperation between genes in order to be able of applying this methods in a way that allows us to unravel new unknown functional aspects of the biology of the
cell and their connections to pathologies.
