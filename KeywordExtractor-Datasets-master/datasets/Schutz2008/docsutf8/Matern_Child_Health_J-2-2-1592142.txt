Conclusions:
 The percentage of women taking folic acid daily has increased modestly since 1995. Despite this increase, the data show that the majority of women of childbearing age still do not take a vitamin containing folic acid daily. Health care providers and maternal child health professionals must continue to promote preconceptional health among all women of childbearing age, and encourage them to take a vitamin containing folic acid daily.

 displays the percentage of women reporting awareness of and knowledge about folic acid, and their daily use of vitamins containing folic acid. Between 1995 and 2001, the percentage of women reporting having heard or read about folic acid increased from 52% in 1995 to 79% in 2001. Since 2001, awareness of folic acid has remained relatively constant at about 80%. Of all women surveyed in 2005, 19% knew that folic acid prevented birth defects, compared to 4% in 1995. Also in 2005, 7% of women knew that folic acid should be taken before pregnancy, compared to 2% in 1995. The proportion of all surveyed women who reported taking a vitamin supplement containing folic acid daily has remained almost unchanged but increased gradually from 28% in 1995 to 40% in 2004, but decreased to 33% in 2005. Of women surveyed in 2005 who were aware of folic acid, 26% identified green leafy vegetables as good sources of folic acid. However, in 2000, fortified cereals were added to the list of possible sources, and only 2–5% of women identified fortified cereals as a good source of folic acid.

In 2005 the women least likely to be aware of folic acid were non-white women (71%), women aged 18–24 years (72%), those women with less than a high school education (58%), and those with a household income of less than $25,000 (72%). These results are consistent with years prior to 2005.

In 2005, 67% of childbearing age women reported they did not take daily supplements. The most common reasons for not taking any daily vitamin or mineral supplements are that they “forget to take them”, stated by 28% of women, or “don't feel they need them” as reported by 16% of women. However, in 2005, 86% of women who were not currently taking daily vitamins or mineral supplements reported they would be likely to start taking a multivitamin daily if advised by their health care provider or physician.


Discussion
3
] the percentage of women taking a vitamin supplement containing folic acid daily has only modestly increased between 1995 and 2005. There was a substantive increase in the percentage of women taking folic acid daily in 2004, but this increase was not sustained in 2005. Clearly, the observed increases in awareness and knowledge about folic acid are not translating into increased multivitamin use.
8
13
]. The results from the 2004 survey may be an anomalous finding, given that many of the findings returned to pre-2004 levels (e.g., multivitamin use). Our findings may suggest the need for more continued and increased media messages to encourage women to consume adequate amounts of folic acid every day through fortified foods, dietary supplements, and a folate-rich diet. Furthermore, communities should identify food products that provide recommended levels of folic acid available in local grocery stores, and encourage women to select diets with sufficient folic acid.
Recent educational efforts alone do not appear to be adequate to demonstrate an impact on changing behavior with regard to folic acid consumption. The findings from this report can be used to develop multi-pronged targeted public health programs to increase the number of women of childbearing age consuming a vitamin containing folic acid daily. Demographic, sociocultural, and environmental factors impact behavior and more attention must be given to these factors. Results from these surveys indicate that variations exist in folic acid awareness, knowledge, and use among women of different race/ethnicity, age groups, education levels, and socioeconomic status. This suggests that the linkage between folic acid awareness, knowledge, and use is more complicated than simply increasing awareness and knowledge. Non-white women, those between the ages of 18–24, those less educated, and those of a lower socioeconomic status are associated with both lower folic acid knowledge and lower use of a vitamin containing folic acid. Targeted messages and teachable opportunities of communication for younger women, women of racial and ethnic groups, and women of low socioeconomic status need to be identified and mobilized to increase the number of childbearing age women taking folic acid daily, regardless of pregnancy plans.
Our results indicated that despite the fact that some women learn about folic acid from their health care provider, most women are not currently following their health care provider's advice even though they might feel the recommendation is important. This is apparent when looking at the proportion of women taking a multivitamin daily. In addition, women report they do not take a vitamin containing folic acid because they “feel they don't need to”, or are not receiving the folic acid message from their health provider. More research is needed to understand what the motivators and barriers are for consuming a multivitamin containing folic acid daily to design appropriate interventions (whether service delivery, policy, media messages, or educational in nature) for women of childbearing age. It is important to continue to target educational efforts at health care providers with emphasis on the importance of women of childbearing age taking folic acid daily to prevent NTDs. But, education of health care providers may not be enough by itself. Changing health care provider practices is not merely a matter of knowledge acquisition. Public health programs need to forge stronger alliances with the health care delivery systems at the local and national level to develop and incorporate meaningful folic acid messages into routine counseling and existing health programs and services, since preconceptional counseling is not available to all women of childbearing age. Strategies are needed to understand the context of patient and provider interaction to promote consumption of a daily vitamin containing folic acid among all women of childbearing age, regardless of whether or not they are planning a pregnancy.

]. Fourthly, folic acid use may have been under ascertained since we did not have information on women's dietary folate consumption or their folate levels. Further, self-report of dietary intake, such as taking multivitamins, could be biased by social desirability – the tendency of respondents to respond in a way so as to avoid disapproval, rather than reporting actual beliefs or actions. Finally, surveys of a more representative sample of women of childbearing age in the United States are needed to obtain more precise estimates of folic acid use among this population.

]. This small decline implies that although recommendations might be an important aspect of reducing the rate of NTDs, programs such as fortification could have a broader and more effective impact on the overall rates of NTDs. Countries who try to use a combination of methods – such as fortification and supplementation, along with recommendations and education programs – might see a greater decline in the rates of NTDs.

], more aggressive efforts are needed to increase the number of women consuming 400 mcg of folic acid daily through fortified food or dietary supplement to reduce the prevalence of NTDs.
To succeed in eliminating all folic acid preventable birth defects beyond what fortification has already achieved, more must be done besides educating women and their health care providers. Pregnancies and births affected by spina bifida or anencephaly have profound physical, emotional, and financial effects on families and communities. This year there will be an estimated 3,000 NTD-affected pregnancies. This study reinforces the need for public health practitioners to mobilize multiple sectors, including health care professionals, government organizations, state and local organizations, advocacy groups, and concerned citizens to coordinate efforts and activities to help alleviate a devastating public health issue.
