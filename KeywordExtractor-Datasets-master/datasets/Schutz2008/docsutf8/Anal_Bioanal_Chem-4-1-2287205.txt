We describe the development and validation of a high-resolution screening (HRS) platform which couples gradient reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) on-line to estrogen receptor α (ERα) affinity detection using fluorescence polarization (FP). FP, which allows detection at high wavelengths, limits the occurrence of interference from the autofluorescence of test compounds in the bioassay. A fluorescein-labeled estradiol derivative (E2-F) was synthesized and a binding assay was optimized in platereader format. After subsequent optimization in flow-injection analysis (FIA) mode, the optimized parameters were translated to the on-line HRS bioassay. Proof of principle was demonstrated by separating a mixture of five compounds known to be estrogenic (17β-estradiol, 17α-ethinylestradiol and the phytoestrogens coumestrol, coumarol and zearalenone), followed by post-column bioaffinity screening of the individual affinities for ERα. Using the HRS-based FP setup, we were able to screen affinities of off-line-generated metabolites of zearalenone for ERα. It is concluded that the on-line FP-based bioassay can be used to screen for the affinity of compounds without the disturbing occurrence of autofluorescence.

In this so-called HRS setup we separated mixtures of known estrogenic compounds—e.g., 17β-estradiol, 17α-ethinylestradiol and the phytoestrogens coumestrol, coumarol and zearalenone—and screened the individual compounds for ERα affinities. We also showed that this HRS ERα-FP system was suitable for screening off-line-generated cytochrome P450 (Cyt P450) metabolites of zearalenone for ERα affinity. We conclude that we were able to incorporate an on-line FP detector cell into a HRS system to screen for the ERα affinities of individual compounds in complex mixtures without incurring interference from the autofluorescence of the compounds.

 microplate fluorometer from BMG LABTECH GmbH (Offenburg, Germany) was used for the FP-based microplate reader assay. The excitation wavelength was set at 485 nm, the emission wavelength at 520 nm. Black-bottomed PP-96-well microtiter plates from Greiner Bio-one (Alphen a/d Rijn, The Netherlands) were used for all microplate reader experiments.

One filter (12.5 mm visible pol. 350–650 nm 03FPG019) was placed in the pathway of the excitation beam and one (Mount. Sheet Pol. 20.D- 16.9CA 03FPG001) in the pathway of the emission beam. All hardware was integrated into one HRS system by Kiadis B.V. (Groningen, the Netherlands), and was controlled by software developed by Kiadis B.V.

], can improve the resolution of the assay in HRS mode, and since organic modifiers are necessary for the optimal performance of the gradient HPLC system, the next step in the optimization process was to vary these parameters. The experiments were carried out at 24 °C with well volumes of 250 μL binding buffer [potassium phosphate buffer (10 mM; pH 7.4) containing 0.4 mg/ml ELISA blocking reagent]. The ERα LBD was introduced into the binding assay buffer at a final concentration of 1.64 nM. The E2-F stock solution was prepared in DMSO and dilutions were made in binding buffer. Concentrations ranging from 0.42 nM to 3.31 μM were investigated for E2-F optimization. For the experiments to investigate the detergent and organic modifier effects, the final concentration of E2-F in the assay was 83.3 nM. Aliquots of 25 μL of organic modifier or detergent at various concentrations were pipetted into a 96-well plate that already contained either 75 μL binding buffer (equal to 0% displacement) or 75 μL 33.3 μM E2 in binding buffer (equal to 100% displacement). The 96-well plate was gently but thoroughly mixed after pipetting 75 μL E2-F into each well. Finally, 75 μL of the ERα LBD was pipetted into the wells. After an incubation time of 60 min at room temperature, the fluorescence polarization (FP) was recorded at 485 nm excitation and 520 nm emission. All experiments were performed in quadruplicate. The difference in FP (ΔFP) was calculated by subtracting the FP value found at 100% displacement from the FP value found when no E2 was present under different conditions.

A makeup gradient, controlled by makeup gradient pumps P3 and P4, is introduced and eluting compounds are mixed in the first reaction coil with ERα delivered by superloop-1 (SL-1). In the second reaction coil, the probe ligand E2-F is added to the mix by superloop-2 (SL-2). ERα affinity detection is performed using a fluorescence detector (FLD). In FIA mode the samples are delivered directly by a carrier solution into the bioassay

One-tenth of the total makeup flow was combined with one-tenth of the HPLC eluent and this flow was directed to the ERα FP RAD at 160 μl/min. The remaining part of the flow in the ERα FP RAD was the same as described above, with the exception that the HPLC flow combined with the makeup flow replaced the carrier solution flow.

 values of known estrogenic compounds in both microplate reader format and in FIA mode. We used the optimized conditions in FIA mode to couple the ERα bioassay on-line to a gradient HPLC system. In HPLC mode we measured the ERα bioaffinities of different estrogenic compounds and screened mixtures with five known estrogenic compounds. Finally, we measured the individual ERα bioaffinities of zearalenone and its metabolites generated off-line by Cyt P450 in HPLC mode.

). In this system, compounds introduced by a carrier solution are allowed to bind to the ERα LBD in a first reaction coil, and the E2-F tracer is introduced after this coil. The tracer compound can interact with the unbound receptor in a second reaction coil and detection takes place after the second reaction coil using FP detection. In a FIA setup, carrier solution replaces the gradient HPLC system, thereby allowing the direct injection of compounds and the optimization of on-line assay conditions before final on-line coupling to HPLC. The influence of the ERα LBD and E2-F tracer concentrations and the corresponding excitation and emission wavelengths were investigated in FIA mode in order to optimize the performance of the FP ERα RAD system. The influences of ACN and MeOH, later used in HPLC mode too, on the FP ERα RAD system performance were also tested in the FIA mode. All measurements were performed in duplicate.

Excitation and emission wavelengths
 When the excitation and emission wavelengths were varied, the optimal FP signal responses in FIA mode were obtained at an excitation wavelength of 498 nm and an emission wavelength of 522 nm (data not shown). These wavelengths were therefore used to further optimize the on-line FP system in FIA mode.

]. The sensitivity of the FP-based HRS platform is comparable to that of the coumestrol-based HRS platform, and no interference from fluorescence was observed at wavelengths below 450 nm. The novel on-line FP detector cell can in principle be applied to other HPLC-based bioaffinity assays which require FP detection. The present HRS ERα FP system offers a novel technology for investigating the metabolic profiles of drugs and other compounds such as phytoestrogens which cannot be measured by the coumestrol-based HRS system due to the occurrence of autofluorescence from the test compounds.
