]. This recently recognised situation further enhances the capacity of the adipose compartment to remove fatty acids through uncoupled beta oxidation.In order to understand the mechanism by which mitochondria in adipocytes contribute to the control of body fat distribution during the development of the metabolic syndrome, additional studies are needed, comprising quantification of fatty acid fluxes in relation to re-esterification and oxidation in adipose tissue. These studies should include study of adipose tissue from individuals with normal glucose tolerance and from those with developing glucose intolerance.
