These results indicate that whole leg extension strength is associated with the ability to prevent a fall after a gait perturbation and might be used to identify the elderly at risk of falling.

) have investigated the relation between muscle strength and the outcome of an induced trip. In a group of older adults, they compared isolated ankle, knee, and hip flexion and extension strength between those who recovered from a trip, and those who fell. Although some strong adults fell, presumably due to their high walking velocity, they also found that muscle strength was lower in several other fallers.
If low muscle strength indeed is a physiological cause of falls, this raises the question whether people with a high risk of falling can be identified by means of relatively simple maximum muscle strength measures. The aim of this study was to find the best predictor of falls after a gait perturbation in a standardized situation, from a range of muscle strength measures in older adults.

Elderly volunteers performed these maximum strength capacity tests and we measured their ability to prevent a fall after being tripped. We hypothesized that maximum muscle strength measures can be used to differentiate fallers from non-fallers. If so, this would not only allow identification of potential fallers, but also indicate specific limiting factors to target with exercise-based interventions.

Methods
Seventeen healthy older adults participated [10 women: age 71 (SD 4.5) years, mass 75 (SD 9) kg, height 1.68 (SD 0.09) m]. All participants were fit and had no orthopedic, neuromuscular, cardiac or visual problems. The Ethics Committees the VU Medical Center and of the Manchester Metropolitan University approved the procedure and all subjects gave their written, informed consent before participation.

Subjects were aware that they could be tripped on either leg, but did not know whether and where an obstacle would appear in the ongoing trial. They wore a safety harness that moved along a track above the walkway. Subjects were classified as fallers based on visual detection of full body support by the harness (checked by video), in more than 50% of the tripping trials.

Discussion
It is important to identify individuals most at risk of falling, because they should be considered with priority for receiving targeted exercise interventions aimed at reducing the incidence of falls. This study investigated the possibility to identify fallers from maximum strength measures that could be applied in clinical settings. The results showed that participants who fell after a gait perturbation could indeed be identified based on these measures. Especially, a classification model based on maximum leg press push-off force yielded high sensitivity and specificity in cross-validation.

). Since the trip was induced manually, it may be that faster walkers were more likely to be tripped in late swing. It is therefore unclear whether velocity or instant of trip initiation was responsible for a number of stronger subjects falling. In our study, however, walking velocity was not different between fallers and non-fallers and in the range of “fast walkers” of the study of Pavol, even though we did not standardize it and explicitly instructed subjects to walk at their normal and comfortable velocity. Furthermore, we were able to trip all subjects at exactly mid-swing (when the toe height is minimal and a trip is most likely in daily life). This implies that the effect of the trip by impact with the obstacle was equal over subjects and could not affect the outcome of the trip. Yet, this also may suggest that instant of trip initiation and in a more heterogeneous group, differences in preferred walking velocity must be taken into account when attempting to identify fallers.
Although we were able to trip our subjects repeatedly, three of the fallers and one non-faller did not complete the whole protocol up to five tripping trials, due to discomfort. Nevertheless, the fallers fell in all trials and the non-faller did not fall in four tripping trials. Hence, the number of tripping trials did not affect the classification of the participants.

). Since especially hip extension capacity is quite difficult to determine (especially in a clinical setting) and given limitations in the total number of capacity measurements to be performed in a single session, these variables were not included in the present study.

), the requirements for landing need further investigation.
Fallers and non-fallers were classified in this study based on their ability to prevent a fall after an experimentally induced gait perturbation. In daily life, there are many various ways in which people fall. Furthermore, this experimental study included a small number of participants, which might have influenced the predictive values. A prospective study with a larger cohort is necessary to generalize the results of this study to the prediction of falls in daily life.

). Jump height indeed resulted in good sensitivity and specificity. This task was less similar to the actual tripping action than the leg press and does not solely reflect strength, as it also requires complex coordination of many joints. One might argue that the older fallers, who were all women, may have been more afraid to jump maximally than their counterparts. However, jump height was strongly correlated to maximum leg press push-off force, which was measured in a secure and comfortable setting. Jumping performance, therefore, more likely reflects lower limb strength than an effect of gender or fear.

2003b
). Our data indeed showed that grip strength is significantly correlated with lower limb capacities and that it can be used to identify fallers from non-fallers. Although hand grip strength is easy to measure and assumed to be related to whole body strength, one should bear in mind that this measure may be less accurate as a predictor for falls it is not task specific for balance recovery.

Conclusion
Relatively simple and accessible measures of maximum strength did identify elderly fallers from non-fallers after a standardized gait perturbation. The capacity to generate maximum extension force by the whole leg (e.g., in a leg press apparatus or during jumping) resulted in the best classification of older fallers and non-fallers. Follow up studies on larger cohorts with a wide range of muscle strength and walking velocities are necessary to generalize these results towards a valid prediction of fall risk.
