Tubulo-interstitial fibrosis is a constant feature of chronic renal failure and it is suspected to contribute importantly to the deterioration of renal function. In the fibrotic kidney there exists, besides normal fibroblasts, a large population of myofibroblasts, which are supposedly responsible for the increased production of intercellular matrix. It has been proposed that myofibroblasts in chronic renal failure originate from the transformation of tubular cells via epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) or from infiltration by bone marrow-derived precursors. Little attention has been paid to the possibility of a transformation of resident fibroblasts into myofibroblasts in renal fibrosis. Therefore we examined the fate of resident fibroblasts in the initial phase of renal fibrosis in the classical model of unilateral ureter obstruction (UUO) in the rat. Rats were perfusion-fixed on days 1, 2, 3 and 4 after ligature of the right ureter. Starting from 1 day of UUO an increasing expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin (αSMA) in resident fibroblasts was revealed by immunofluorescence and confirmed by the observation of bundles of microfilaments and webs of intermediate filaments in the electron microscope. Inversely, there was a decreased expression of 5′-nucleotidase (5′NT), a marker of renal cortical fibroblasts. The RER became more voluminous, suggesting an increased synthesis of matrix. Intercellular junctions, a characteristic feature of myofibroblasts, became more frequent. The mitotic activity in fibroblasts was strongly increased. Renal tubules underwent severe regressive changes but the cells retained their epithelial characteristics and there was no sign of EMT. In conclusion, after ureter ligature, resident peritubular fibroblasts proliferated and they showed progressive alterations, suggesting a transformation in myofibroblasts. Thus the resident fibroblasts likely play a central role in fibrosis in that model.

). In contrast, the possibility of a transformation of resident fibroblasts into myofibroblasts in renal fibrosis has hardly been considered. There is little information on the behavior and fate of resident fibroblasts in fibrosis in the kidney, in particular whether they proliferate and differentiate into myofibroblasts.
The aim of our present investigation was to study the morphology of cortical peritubular interstitium, with a focus on the resident fibroblasts, during the first 4 days following ureteral ligature in rats. UUO is a commonly used experimental model for inducing renal fibrosis and is furthermore of outmost clinical relevance. We choose to study the early events after ureteral ligature because in early stages the identification of cell types and their putative phenotypical changes might be better traceable than in advanced stages of fibrosis. We include in our study also the early effects of UUO on tubular epithelia.
We performed our investigation by light and electron microscopy, as well as immunofluorescence, and we included morphometric quantification of tissue components and analysis of changes in the proliferation rates of interstitial cells.
We demonstrate that resident fibroblasts progressively gain the phenotype of myofibroblasts and massively increase their rate of cell division during the first days after ureteral ligature. Our data suggest that resident peritubular fibroblasts transform to myofibroblsts and participate importantly in the development of renal fibrosis.

Methods
Experimental design
For induction of UUO male 20 Sprague–Dawley rats weighing 160 ± 3 g were anesthetized using isoflurane and the abdominal cavity was opened by a midline incision. The right ureter was tied with 4/0 silk 3–5 mm below the renal hilum. The rats of the control group (four rats) were also laparatomized, the ureter exposed, but no ligature was made. After closure of the abdomen the animals were returned to the cage with free access to standard lab chow and water ad libitum.
The experimental procedure conformed to the Institutional Guidelines of Experimental Animal Care and Use and was approved by the Veterinary office of the Kanton Zürich.

Tissue fixation
1989
). The control group was perfused on day 4. The occluded renal pelvis was cut open just before perfusion to allow outflow of the fluid from the kidney. The fixative solution was composed of 3% paraformaldehyde, 0.01% glutardialdehyde and 0.05% picric acid in a 6:4 mixture of 0.1 M cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4, adjusted to 300 mOsm with sucrose) and 10% hydroxyethyl starch in saline (HAES steril TM; Fresenius AG, Germany). Five minutes after onset of the fixation both kidneys were removed.

Light and electron microscopy
From the unligated left and from the ligated right kidney large tissue blocks extending from the renal capsule to at least the upper third of the inner zone were immersed for at least 24 h in the fixative solution described above to which 1% glutardialdehyde was added. This tissue was then embedded into epoxy resin and used for light and electron microscopy. Semithin (1 μm) sections and ultrathin (80 nm) sections were cut with an ultramicrotome. Semithin sections were stained with 1% methylene blue and 1% azure II and were studied with a Polyvar microscope (Reichert Jung, Vienna, Austria). Ultrathin sections were postfixed with osmium tetroxyde and contrasted with uranyl acetate and studied with a CM100 Philips electron microscope.

Sections were studied by epifluorescence with a Polyvar microscope (Reichert Jung, Vienna, Austria), and digital images were acquired with a CCD camera.

Quantitative evaluation
In order to quantify changes in the structural composition of the renal cortex and to assess the mitotic rates of interstitial cells within this area, a morphometrical analysis was undertaken on sections of kidneys from three rats in each of the five experimental groups.

 was photographed at 100× magnification using a Leica DMRBE microscope (Leica Microsystems, Heerbrugg, Switzerland) connected to a Olympus SIS colorview camera (Olympus Soft imaging systems, Münster, Germany). The individual micrographs were merged to one large image and the exact size of the total image area was subsequently determined by analySIS software (Olympus Soft imaging systems, Münster, Germany).
The images were overlaid with a 15 × 15 grid to assign the histological structures covered by each of the 225 intersections to one of five categories, namely tubules, capillaries, interstitium, renal corpuscles and large vessels. The fractional areas of these histological structures were defined as the ratio of the number of category-specific intersections to the total number of intersections (225).
Furthermore, the total numbers of peritubular interstitial cells in the image were counted and the numbers of mitotic cells in the cortical interstitium were recorded. This allowed calculating the fraction of mitotic cells in relation to all interstitial cells. The identity of each mitotic cell in the cortical interstitium was attributed to one of the two categories “fibroblasts” or “mononuclear cells” (dendritic cells, infiltrating leucocytes) independently by two investigators. Mitotic cells that could not be assigned to one of these two categories or that were classified differently by the two investigators recorded as ‘non-identified’.

Results
Macroscopy
The ligature of the right ureter resulted invariably in each rat in a large expansion of the renal pelvis within the renal sinus and of the ureter above the ligature. The enlargement appeared more prominent at the first and second day after the operation than after the third and fourth day. The fluid contained in the expanded renal pelvis was clear up to the second day and appeared trouble and viscous the third and fourth day. In sham operated rats no expansion of the renal pelvis was observed.

In all cases the proximal tubule were lined by a continuous epithelium showing ultra-structural evidence of polarity like microvilli at the luminal aspect and morphologically intact junctional complexes. We found no instance of disruption of the tubular basement membrane. The polarized expression of 5′NT at the luminal pole of all proximal tubules further evidenced the preservation of epithelial architecture in proximal tubules. Tubular cell death was not conspicuous in the cortex. Mitotic cells were rather frequently observed in proximal tubules from day 2 on. At the same time epithelial cells, including mitotic cells, were occasionally seen in the lumen, indicating some degree of anoikosis. From day 3 on an increasing number of proximal tubular profiles bound anti collagen 1-antibodies. Even in those profiles the individual epithelial cells were still recognizable.

Accumulation of collagen type I in the peritubular interstitium
Accumulation of collagen I (Col I) in the interstitial space is a hallmark of renal fibrosis. Collagen type I is produced by (myo)fibroblasts. By immunofluorescence Col I was virtually absent in the cortical peritubular interstitial space of controls. A modest immunofluorescence was apparent along the tubular profiles.

). Thus, cell proliferation affected the various stages of transformation of fibroblasts in myofibroblasts.
Mitotic figures in tubules and in capillaries were rare in control kidneys. They were easily found in occluded kidneys on day 2, and less so on days 1, 3 and 4. Quantification was not carried out.



Discussion
The main purpose of the present study was to investigate the early response to ureter obstruction of resident fibroblasts in the renal cortex. Two major alterations were observed, starting from the first day after ligature of the ureter in the rat. Firstly, ultrastructural features and the expression of specific proteins suggested the progressive acquisition by virtually all fibroblasts of characteristic features of myofibroblasts. Because the transformation did not affect all fibroblasts simultaneously a large heterogeneity in the phenotypes of fibroblasts was present. Secondly, the incidence of mitosis of fibroblasts increased dramatically, affecting the various phenotypes of fibroblasts.

). Co expression of 5’NT with αSMA was never observed in interstitial cells of control or contralateral kidneys but appeared already on day 1 after UUO, and became progressively more frequent up to day 4, where nearly all 5’NT-positive fibroblasts expressed more or less strongly αSMA. Thus, it appears that during the first days of UUO virtually all resident fibroblasts acquired the most characteristic feature of myofibroblats.

In conclusion, during the first days following ureter ligature the resident peritubular fibroblasts differentiate into myofibroblasts and they proliferate strongly. These events are likely essential to fibrosis in UUO.
