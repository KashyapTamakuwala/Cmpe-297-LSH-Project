Hypothesis
Laparoscopic liver surgery is significantly limited by the technical difficulty encountered during transection of substantial liver parenchyma, with intraoperative bleeding and bile leaks. This study tested whether the use of a bioabsorble staple line reinforcement material would improve outcome during stapled laparoscopic left lateral liver resection in a porcine model.

Conclusion
Use of a bioabsorbable staple line reinforcement material reduces intraoperative bleeding and perioperative bile leaks during stapled laparoscopic left lateral liver resection in a porcine model.

We hypothesized that the addition of a bioabsorbable membrane to reinforce standard laparoscopic stapling devices would reduce the bleeding and biliary complications of stapled laparoscopic liver resections. We tested this hypothesis in a prospective survival study of 20 pigs undergoing laparoscopic left lateral liver resections.

Data collection
Operative data recorded at the time of surgery included operative time, specimen size, and blood loss as estimated by amount of fluid collected in a suction container minus irrigation fluid used. Animals were prospectively followed with regard to clinical outcome for 6 weeks. Clinical status (temperature, blood pressure = BP, heart rate = HR) was examined routinely on a daily basis unless clinical condition mandated additional assessment. Routine blood tests (bilirubin, ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, GGT, and complete blood count) were obtained 2 days and 6 weeks postoperatively.
Animals were sacrificed at 6 weeks and examined for intra-abdominal abnormalities such as abscess or bile leaks. Standard methylene blue was injected into the biliary tree to examine for active biliary leaks. A standardized pressure-controlled injector using a green sized syringe injected 5–10 ml methylene blue into the ligated common bile duct. Subsequently, the cut edge of the liver was examined both macroscopically and microscopically for evidence of biliary leak. The cut edge of the liver was then sent for histopathological analysis.

Statistical analysis

Results
All animals tolerated the procedure well and were healthy during the entire follow up. Clinical status (temperature, blood pressure, heart rate) examined routinely on a daily basis were not different. All animals resumed normal diet within 1 day and had their first bowel movement within 2–3 days. Routine blood tests (bilirubin, ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, GGT, white blood cell, hemoglobin, hematocrit) obtained 2 days and 6 weeks postoperatively showed no abnormalities in either group.

]. The fact that this material is completely bioabsorbable should reduce concerns over possible long-term complications such as migration, erosion, calcification, and infection. In addition, this synthetic copolymer does not carry the risk of animal source contamination. The histopathological examination of the resection line of both groups showed fibrotic changes in group B in contrast to group A. This may be caused by excess mechanical stress which was avoided in group A due to addition of a staple line reinforcement.
Our results show that transaction using conventional stapling devices is inadequate but that the addition of a bioabsorbable staple line reinforcement material to standard laparoscopic stapling devices can reduce intraoperative blood loss during transection of liver parenchyma. In addition, there was a reduction in postoperative bile leaks, although in this study these leaks were not clinically significant. Bioabsorbable reinforcement improves on complications and is a viable addition to laparoscopic liver resection.
