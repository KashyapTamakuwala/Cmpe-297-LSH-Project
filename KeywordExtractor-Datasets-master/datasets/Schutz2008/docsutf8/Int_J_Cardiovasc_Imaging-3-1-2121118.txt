Background
Noncompaction cardiomyopathy (NCCM) is a recently recognized disorder frequently associated with systolic and diastolic heart failures. This study was designed to examine aortic stiffness in NCCM patients and to compare these results to age- and gender-matched controls.

Methods
β

Results

 < 0.001).

Conclusion
Increased aortic stiffness can be observed in patients with NCCM with moderate to severe heart failure. These alterations may be due to neurohormonal changes in heart failure.

Diagnostic criteria for NCCM

] were used: (1) absence of coexisting cardiac anomalies, (2) segmental, excessive thickening of the left ventricular (LV) wall with a two-layered structure: a thin, compacted epicardial layer and a much thicker, noncompacted layer with the characteristic appearance of numerous, prominent trabeculations (meshwork) and deep intertrabecular recesses, (3) color Doppler evidence of deeply perfused intertrabecular recesses, and (4) predominant localization of thickening in the LV apical, midlateral, and midinferior walls. Hypertensive heart disease was excluded by clinical and echocardiographic examinations (septal thickness < 13 mm).

Blood pressure measurement
Systolic and diastolic blood pressures (SBP and DBP, respectively) were measured in the supine position with an automatic mercury cuff sphygmomanometer from the left arm after 10 min of rest. The first and the fifth Koratkoff sounds were taken for the SBP and DBP. Blood pressure values were averaged from three consecutive measurements. None of the patients or controls used coffee or tea within 1 h before blood pressure measurements.

). Three HF patients were in NYHA-class III HF and the other five were in NYHA-class II. Cardiac medication used in NCCM patients were: angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in 13 (65%), beta-blockers in 11 (55%), oral anticoagulant therapy in 10 (50%), diuretics in 8 (40%), digitalis in 2 (10%), and nitrate in 1 (5%). None of the controls received any cardiac medication.

Conclusions
Increased aortic stiffness can be observed in patients with NCCM with moderate to severe HF. These alterations may be due to HF-induced neurohormonal changes.
