Introduction
The biological factors responsible for differential chemoresponsiveness in oligodendroglial tumours with or without the −1p/−19q genotype are unknown, but tumour vascularity may contribute. We aimed to determine whether dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) could distinguish molecular subtypes of oligodendroglial tumour, and examined the relationship between relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) and outcome following procarbazine, lomustine and vincristine (PCV) chemotherapy.

=0.001). Receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed a cut-off of 1.59 for identifying genotype (sensitivity 92%, specificity 76%). Tumours with high and low rCBV showed response to chemotherapy. The −1p/−19q genotype, but not rCBV, was strongly associated with response, progression-free and overall survival following PCV chemotherapy. Tumours with high rCBV and intact 1p/19q were associated with shorter progression-free and overall patient survival than those with intact 1p/19q and low rCBV or high rCBV and 1p/19q loss.

Conclusion
rCBV identifies oligodendroglial tumours with 1p/19q loss, but does not predict chemosensitivity. The prognostic significance of rCBV may differ in oligodendroglial tumours with or without the −1p/−19q genotype.

The aim of this study was to determine whether DSC-MRI obtained through routine pre-therapy MR diagnostic examinations may be used to distinguish molecular subtypes of oligodendroglial tumours, and to investigate the influence of tumour blood volume on outcome following procarbazine, lomustine and vincristine (PCV) chemotherapy compared to molecular genetics.

] and reflects the range of patients given PCV chemotherapy in routine clinical practice. Tumours with rCBV >1.59 were more likely to have 1p/19q loss. PCV chemosensitivity was predicted by 1p/19q loss, but high rCBV was not necessary for response. Following chemotherapy, rCBV was significantly associated with PFS and OS only after adjustment for genotype.

], placement of ROI in regions within tumour of greatest signal intensity yielded data with good inter- and intraobserver variability. The greatest variation was seen in tumours with high rCBV, reflecting heterogeneity of blood volume within these tumours. In this series, tumours with the −1p/−19q genotype were more likely to have high rCBV than those with intact 1p/19q. The ROC analysis determined an optimal cut-off (rCBV >1.59) for predicting the −1p/−19q genotype with 92% sensitivity and 76% specificity. These data suggest that in conjunction with histopathology, rCBV may be used to distinguish tumours of the oligodendroglial lineage.

], high rCBV predicted poor prognosis. In our series, rCBV alone was an unreliable indicator of outcome, showing prognostic significance only after stratification for genotype, suggesting different effects for the two genetic subgroups at the cut-off used to classify tumours with high rCBV. With this cut-off, tumours with high rCBV and 1p/19q loss were associated with longer survival than those with high rCBV and intact 1p/19q. Unlike astrocytic gliomas, high rCBV values do not necessarily indicate aggressive biology associated with poor outcome in oligodendroglial neoplasms with 1p/19q loss, suggestive of differences in the baseline biology of these two genetic subtypes. These preliminary data therefore indicate that further investigation of the prognostic significance of rCBV in molecular subtypes of glioma in a much larger series is warranted.

Conclusion
In conclusion, we have shown that high rCBV is more likely in oligodendroglial tumours with the −1p/−19q genotype and may be a useful aid to diagnosis; however, rCBV does not predict chemosensitivity. Lack of correlation with histopathology grade and the data suggesting that the prognostic significance of rCBV may differ in patients with or without the −1p/−19q genotype, indicates that different interpretation of rCBV data may be necessary for oligodendroglial compared with astrocytic gliomas. Further study is essential to fully evaluate the role of DSC-MRI in the non-invasive diagnosis and prediction of prognosis in gliomas with an oligodendroglial phenotype.
