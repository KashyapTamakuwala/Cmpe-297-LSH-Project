. Recently a modified electrode construction technique has allowed us to use CASMs with very slender tips and longer lives made from thin-walled quartz glass. We have also found it possible, with a motorized micromanipulator, to move the CASMs in repeatable steps up and down, usually without apparently causing damage to the cell.

 were measured using CASMs. The main differences from previous methods were that we made the CASMs with quartz rather than aluminosilicate glass and used a motorized micromanipulator (Luigs & Neumann, Ratingen, Germany) to move the CASM up and down in reproducible steps. Rotating the Z-control wheel by 360° moved the CASM up or down by 40 μm, thus for a 20 μm step we rotated it manually by 180°.

Half-response times ranged from 0.2 to 0.5 s, but were not routinely measured. Results were discarded if on withdrawal the electrode potentials had changed by more than 7 mV.

 transients were measured in succession at different depths. The relative distance was reconstructed from the micromanipulator movements that were all either 10 or 20 μm. The diameter of the cell was estimated from all of these successive steps. Unfortunately the absolute position (offset) of the transient measured closest to the membrane was not known exactly. We therefore allowed the depth as an adjustable parameter within the limits of ±10 μm. The transients measured closer to the middle were therefore more reliable. Furthermore, the response time of the electrode was estimated to be about 1.5–2.5 s and was allowed to vary within these limits. The remaining four unknown parameters in the transport equation, together with the response time, were obtained from an optimal fit. A simplex search algorithm was used to find this least square fit. To increase reliability of the parameter estimates, several transients measured at different depths were fitted simultaneously. Also, any slow baseline drift was removed and the first two seconds of the transients, that show an electrical artefact, were not used during the fitting process.

 as the CASM was advanced deeper and deeper into a cell is that the electrode insertion induced a leak at the site of penetration. As the CASM was pushed in, its tip moved further away from the leak, which itself may be reduced by better sealing. During long experiments, as shown below, CASM movement had less dramatic effects on steady-state levels, suggesting that the leak declined with time.

A shows eight simultaneously fitted transients that were measured in the middle of a long experiment at various depths ranging form close to the membrane at about 20 μm to about 70 μm away from the membrane. The depths estimated from micrometer movements are the lower values shown above the peaks. To fit the data these positions were allowed to vary within the limits of half a CASM step. The depths obtained from the fit (upper values) are reasonably close to the micrometer positions. Interestingly, modelled positions near the membrane are slightly shifted towards the centre of the cell, which might indicate lower mobility close to the membrane.

 signals with the indicator may have subtle effects, which are hard to predict. It is to be regretted that CASMs so far have such large tips and slow responses that they can be used only on exceptionally large cells.

 calcium transient for various diffusion coefficients as function of the cell diameter. Modelled calcium recovery times for spherical neurones of diameters up to 250 μm, assuming that diffusion is the rate-limiting process. Most neurones are in the range of 0–50 μm and recover in a few seconds; slow diffusion is not critical in those cases. Large snail neurones recover in about 10–20 s, which requires faster diffusion.
