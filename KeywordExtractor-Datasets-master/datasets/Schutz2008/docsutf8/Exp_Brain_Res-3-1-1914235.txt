Although previous studies indicated that the stability properties of interlimb coordination largely result from the integrated timing of efferent signals to both limbs, they also depend on afference-based interactions. In the present study, we examined contributions of afference-based error corrections to rhythmic bimanual coordination using a kinesthetic tracking task. Furthermore, since we found in previous research that subjects activated their muscles in the tracked (motor-driven) arm, we examined the functional significance of this activation to gain more insight into the processes underlying this phenomenon. To these aims, twelve subjects coordinated active movements of the right hand with motor-driven oscillatory movements of the left hand in two coordinative patterns: in-phase (relative phase 0°) and antiphase (relative phase 180°). They were either instructed to activate the muscles in the motor-driven arm as if moving along with the motor (active condition), or to keep these muscles as relaxed as possible (relaxed condition). We found that error corrections were more effective in in-phase than in antiphase coordination, resulting in more adequate adjustments of cycle durations to compensate for timing errors detected at the start of each cycle. In addition, error corrections were generally more pronounced in the active than in the relaxed condition. This activity-related difference was attributed to the associated bilateral neural control signals (as estimated using electromyography), which provided an additional reference (in terms of expected sensory consequences) for afference-based error corrections. An intimate relation was revealed between the (integrated) motor commands to both limbs and the processing of afferent feedback.

), suggesting a key role for afference-independent (i.e., open-loop) control processes. Collectively, these findings motivated the present study on kinesthetic tracking, which (1) examined the closed-loop control processes underlying rhythmic bimanual coordination, and (2) addressed the potential interplay between open-loop and closed-loop control in the production of rhythmic bimanual movements.

). Note that this second account of the EMG activity in the driven limb, which in fact served as a working hypothesis for the present study, implies an intimate relation between two of the aforementioned sources of interlimb interaction, viz. error correction based on the perceived relative phase, and the integrated timing of the feedforward signals (providing the reference pattern).
The aim of the present study was to examine the afference-based error corrections in detail using a kinesthetic tracking task, with a specific focus on the role of the muscle activity in the motor-driven arm, to elucidate the interplay of closed-loop and open-loop control processes in rhythmic bimanual coordination. We compared the performance during in-phase and antiphase coordination to further our understanding of the potential contribution of closed-loop control processes to the differential stability of these patterns. In addition, we examined the stability-related effects of bilateral muscle activation during kinesthetic tracking on the resulting coordinative stability. To address the latter issue we compared two conditions in which subjects were either instructed to keep the motor-driven limb relaxed, or to activate their muscles as if moving along with the imposed motor-driven movement. For the latter condition, the phase relations at the level of neural control signals (based on electromyographic data) and at the behavioral level (kinematics) were compared. The neural control signals represent the reference signal that may be used for the prediction of sensory consequences of the ongoing movement, whereas the kinematic phase relation reflects the actual quality of the performance. In both conditions, we performed an extensive analysis of the correlations between various kinematic variables to uncover the underlying structure of the timing corrections based on the (perceived) errors in the relative phase.

Materials and methods
Subjects
1971
). They had no previous experience with the task and reported no (history of) neurological disorders. The local ethics committee approved the experiment and all subjects gave their written informed consent before the experiment was conducted.

Apparatus
Subjects sat in a height-adjustable chair with their elbows slightly flexed and their feet supported. Each forearm was placed in the apparatus in a neutral position (thumbs up and palms facing inward), and its position was restrained (by the support surface on the medial and ventral side, by two vertical foam-coated supports on the dorsal side, and by one horizontal foam-coated support on the lateral side) to prevent movements about the elbow. Both hands were fixated against the flat manipulanda using two Velcro straps, with all fingers extended. The apparatus only permitted flexion–extension movements of the wrist in the horizontal plane. The right manipulandum was mounted on a potentiometer (Sakae, type FCP40A-5k, linearity 0.1%) to register wrist joint angles during active movement, while the left was connected to a servo-controlled motor that moved the hand passively. The potentiometer’s output voltage was digitized by a 12-bit ADC (Labmaster DMA) and stored on a microcomputer at a sampling frequency of 1,000 Hz. The active movements were recorded with a precision of about 0.1°. The passive movements were generated using a DC brush motor (PARVEX, type RS440GR) that was controlled by a PC-mounted servo controller (ACS-Tech80, type SB214). The maximum torque of the motor was such that subjects were unable to alter the trajectory of the applied movements, and the maximum error in the trajectory of the passive movements was 0.26°. Subjects wore earmuffs with built-in stereo earphones (Bilsom 787, Flex II), which provided a moderate level of ‘white’ background noise to eliminate any auditory feedback from the motion of the motor. A white opaque screen was used to eliminate visual feedback of the hand movements.
Surface electromyograms (EMG) were obtained from M. flexor carpi radialis (FCR), and M. extensor carpi radialis (ECR) of both arms. A bipolar arrangement of disposable electrodes (Medicotest, Ag/AgCl-electrodes, square 5 × 5 mm pick-up area) was attached with a center-to-center distance of 2 cm after cleansing and abrasion of the skin. The electrodes were positioned in the center of the muscle belly on the line from origin to insertion as determined by palpation. EMG signals were sampled at 1,000 Hz (TMS International, type Porti5-16/ASD; 22 bits ADC) after band-pass filtering (0.5–400 Hz), and stored on a microcomputer.

Procedure
Subjects were instructed to perform smooth oscillatory movements about the right wrist in such a way that (1) peak flexion and peak extension of both wrists were attained simultaneously (in-phase pattern), or (2) peak flexion of one hand coincided with peak extension of the other hand (antiphase pattern). To achieve this, the timing of the active right wrist movements had to be coordinated with the motor-driven movements of the left wrist. Only subjects that were able to perform both movement patterns in at least one of two selection trials at the start of the experiment were included (one candidate subject failed to meet this criterion). After the selection trials the EMG electrodes were applied, and subsequently all subjects performed maximum voluntary contractions (MVCs) by generating an isometric flexion or extension torque with each arm for approximately 3 s. For the purpose of normalization of the EMG, the maximum root mean square (RMS) value of two separate MVC measurements was used in the analysis.
Additional instruction was given to subjects with respect to the muscle activity in the left (driven) arm. Subjects were required either to keep the muscles of the left (driven) arm as relaxed as possible (relaxed condition) or to activate the muscles of the left arm as if they were moving along with the motor-driven manipulandum (active condition). The resulting 2 (Pattern) × 2 (Activity) = 4 conditions were performed in separate blocks of trials, the order of which was counterbalanced across subjects. Each block of trials started with at least four practice trials to familiarize the subjects with the task (if necessary, maximally four additional practice trials were allowed). Once the subject was able to perform the task properly, based on visual assessment by the experimenters, six experimental trials were performed that were used for the analysis.

 = 5°). To assure a smooth start and finish of the trial, the amplitude of the motor-driven movements was gradually increased (from 0°) and decreased (to 0°) during the first and last 3 s of a trial, respectively. The duration of a trial was 30 s. To avoid transient effects and to exclude the cycles in which the amplitude of the passive movement was adjusted, the first 7 and the last 3 s of the trial were discarded, leaving 20 s per trial for analysis.

, which was created without using the data of these two excluded subjects), but typically much less pronounced. For the two excluded subjects the large amplitude of the reactive activity resulted in a shift of the dominant frequency of the power spectrum of left FCR in this condition to twice the movement frequency (i.e., two bursts per cycle). The EMG data of these subjects were excluded from the analyses, because their inclusion resulted in a number of additional significant effects that could all be attributed to this reactive activity, but were not representative for the EMG data of the group as a whole. It should be noted, however, that all phenomena mentioned in the Results section were also observed for the excluded subjects.

In total 25 trials (8.7%) were excluded from the analysis: 9 trials in the active condition (3 trials for in-phase coordination, and 6 trials for antiphase coordination); 16 trials in the relaxed condition (7 trials for in-phase coordination, and 9 trials for antiphase coordination). In each condition all subjects were capable of performing the task in at least three trials in an adequate fashion.

), whereas these constraints did not affect the phase shift for the left (motor-driven) hand. Hence, the two levels were not tightly coupled in this kinesthetic tracking task. To examine the relations between these levels, four different phase relations were studied in conjunction: the phase shifts between neural control signals and behavior for (1) the right hand and (2) the left hand, and the relative phase between the limbs at (3) the behavioral level and (4) the level of neural control signals. The results regarding the relative phase at the behavioral level were presented in the preceding. In the next two subsections the other phase relations (i.e., the phase shifts between rEMG and kinematics and the relative phase between rEMGs of homologous muscles) are presented. The results are combined in the final subsection to provide an overall picture of the temporal relations in the active condition across these different levels.

A tentative explanation of these findings is that (relative) timing errors were detected most accurately at peak flexion of the driven hand and that, as a consequence, the corrections in the following half-cycle were most effective, leading to the highest accuracy in the relative phase at the end of these half-cycles.

). In those studies subjects had been explicitly instructed to ignore the motor-driven movement (i.e., no coordination between the hands was required) in order to study phase entrainment by contralateral afference, implying that the resulting values of the weighted coherence can be regarded as a baseline for the effect of motor-driven movement per se. In contrast, in the active condition the changes in the EMG amplitude of the motor-driven hand resembled those observed for actively performed rhythmic wrist movements (as obtained for the right hand), and significantly larger coherence of the homologous muscle activity was observed.

). Second, the corrections (and, as a consequence, pattern stability) were enhanced if the muscles in the motor-driven arm were activated as if the limb was moving along with the motor. On the other hand, the accuracy of the relative phasing between the limbs was decreased in this situation, indicating that the corrections were based on a different reference signal than in the relaxed condition. The most likely explanation for these findings was that the bilateral neural control signal provided a reference for the evaluation of the kinesthetic afference, in the sense that on the basis of this signal the sensory consequences (of the bimanual movement pattern) could be anticipated. A closed-loop control process that exploits this kind of prediction is apparently more effective in terms of the stabilization of the relative phase. This result suggests an intimate relation between the integrated timing of the feedforward signals (underlying the bilateral activation pattern if both hands are moving actively) and the use of kinesthetic feedback in rhythmic bimanual coordination

, respectively, which are defined in the following [Eqs. (A1), (A3), (A6), and (A5), respectively]. All covariances and correlations represent temporal relations between kinematic variables: the timing of peak flexion and extension. To obtain the correlations the covariances are divided by the product of the standard deviations of the two variables involved (i.e., normalized). Although correlations were analyzed in the present study, because these normalized measures provide an appropriate means to compare the temporal structure of the performance across various conditions, the formal relations between these correlations are more conveniently analyzed in terms of the underlying covariances. Furthermore, as mentioned in “Results”, the effects observed could not be attributed to differences in the associated normalization factors.
