Introduction
Understanding the help-seeking pathways of patients with a putative risk of developing psychosis helps improving development of specialised care services. This study aimed at obtaining information about: type of health professionals contacted by patients at putative risk for psychosis on their help-seeking pathways; number of contacts; type of symptoms leading to contacts with health professionals; interval between initial contact and referral to a specialised outpatient service.

Method
The help-seeking pathways were assessed as part of a prospective study in 104 patients with suspected at-risk states for psychosis.

Results
The mean number of contacts prior to referral was 2.38. Patients with psychotic symptoms more often contacted mental health professionals, whereas patients with insidious and more unspecific features more frequently contacted general practitioners (GPs).

Conclusions
GPs have been found to under-identify the insidious features of emerging psychosis (Simon et al. (2005) Br J Psychiatry 187:274–281). The fact that they were most often contacted by patients with exactly these features calls for focussed and specialised help for primary care physicians. Thus, delays along the help-seeking pathways may be shortened. This may be of particular relevance for patients with the deficit syndrome of schizophrenia.

]. This study is the first to compare the help-seeking behaviour of at-risk patients, patients with first psychotic episodes and of patients neither meeting clinical at-risk nor first episode criteria, but who are concerned about their mental health and thus were assessed in a prodromal service. To the best of our knowledge, it is also the first study to assess symptoms in patients at risk for psychosis at their first presentation to a prodromal service. We expected GPs to be highly represented among the early help-seeking contacts of at-risk patients.

Method
Recruitment strategy
In August 2002, a specialised, low-threshold outpatient service for the assessment of patients considered at-risk for psychosis was established in a semi-urban catchment area of North Western Switzerland (population = 300.000). This “prodromal clinic” is part of the only general psychiatric outpatient clinic of the catchment area and is associated with a public psychiatric hospital. As is the case all over Switzerland, patients can refer themselves directly to any public or private psychiatric facility and do not require referral to mental health systems via gate-keeping GPs. Patients can also be referred by any other source such as GPs, school counsellors, paediatricians or social workers.

].
In our study, sensitised primary and secondary health care providers were encouraged to contact the outpatient clinic whenever one of their patients showed sustained decline in social functioning in a still relatively asymptomatic state; if they showed attenuated or brief intermittent positive psychotic symptoms; or if they suspected that “something odd had been going on” for some time in their patients.
The research protocol was approved by the “Ethikkommission beider Basel”. It was designed to obtain data on help-seeking pathways and to collect longitudinal information about progression of symptoms and social as well as neuropsychological functioning, and was not a treatment trial.

Patient sample
As of January 1st 2003, patients could be referred to our prodromal clinic. Consenting patients were included in the study. Each individual was fully informed about the research protocol. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients, and additionally from the parents if under 18. Patients were considered ineligible for further assessment within the study if they presented a history of a past psychotic episode, traumatic brain injury, epilepsy or other known neurological disorder; other significant medical conditions considered to affect cognitive performance and self-perception; an IQ of below 70; or patients below the age of 18 in the first year and below the age of 14 years in the second year of the present study.

However, formal assessment of interrater reliability was not conducted.

These basic symptoms include: thought interferences; thought perseveration; thought pressure; thought blockages; disturbances of receptive language; decreased ability to discriminate between ideas and perception, phantasy and true memory; unstable ideas of reference; derealisation; visual and acoustic perception disturbances.

(3) Help-seeking patients who were referred to the prodromal clinic for risk assessment, but who did neither meet FE nor AR criteria, were assigned to the Patient Control (PCo) group.

Assessment of help-seeking pathways and of symptoms at prior contacts
After symptom assessment, patients were asked which other professional groups they had previously contacted for similar problems. Further, timing and number of contacts as well as type of symptom leading to each single prior contact were recorded and, whenever possible, corroborated with information from family members. These data were assessed using a semi-structured interview that was designed for this study. However, no information was collected whether referrals to mental health services were voluntary or involuntary.

The significantly longer “delays to referral” following contacts with private psychiatrists and psychologists was associated with the finding that in 58% of all contacts made with these groups, three or more sessions were administered. In comparison, in the vast majority of the cases (83.7%) contacts with GPs were single consultations.


Discussion
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the help-seeking pathways of a patient cohort, which was referred to a prodromal clinic for a suspected at-risk state for psychosis. We were able to confirm the important role of GPs along the help-seeking pathways of patients with emerging psychosis. Furthermore, GPs were contacted in particular by those patients who presented insidious features. It was these patients that showed the longest delays in referral to our specialised outpatient service.

Weaknesses of this paper

]. Fourth, we did not control for patient-related factors that may in a large part contribute to referral delays. These factors may include lack of insight, poor social adjustment, paranoid thoughts or avolition. Finally, the training and role of GPs in the health care system may vary across countries; thus, not all of the findings of our study may be generalisable to other settings. However, our findings emerge from a health system where specialists may be contacted without the referral of the “gate-keeping” GPs. Thus, in health systems with gate-keeping models our findings that GPs are more commonly contacted by individuals with insidious features may warrant appropriate education efforts even stronger.


Conclusions

]. It can thus be expected that help-seeking pathways of patients in early phases of psychosis may be reduced, thus maybe improving the overall outcome of patients.
