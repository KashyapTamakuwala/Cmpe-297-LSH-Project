We examined the literature relating to the safe care of acutely ill hospitalized patients, and found that there are substantial opportunities for improvement. Recent research suggests substantial benefit may be obtained by systems of outreach care that facilitate better integration, co-ordination, collaboration and continuity of multidisciplinary care. Herein we review the various approaches that are being adopted, and suggest the need for continuing evaluation of these systems as they are introduced into different health care systems.

Introduction
Health care providers in many countries are increasingly aware that quality of care can be improved by measures to reduce errors. Evidence suggests that the greatest opportunities for improvement may be in the management of the acutely ill hospitalized patient, where uncertainty, urgency and lack of integration substantially increase the risk of errors leadinf to adverse outcomes. Different approaches to this problem have evolved, including hospitalists in the USA, medical emergency teams in Australia, and outreach care in the UK. Critical care has a central role to play in all three developments, which share the common aim of improving the safe care of acutely ill patients as they travel through the health care system. We will review the background, methods, roles and benefits of these various systems which we group under the heading of 'outreach' care.

Method
We focused on identifying research publications that examined ways of improving the integration of critical care with acute care services as a means of improving the safe care of acutely ill hospitalized patients. Publications were initially identified by an electronic search of Medline and Cinahl, and the cited references provided additional material. The initial date range searched was 1995–2003 to ensure that current research and up to date literature was reviewed. However, this produced only a limited number of references, and the time period was therefore extended to 1990. Keywords searched singularly and in combination were 'acute pain team', 'suboptimal care', 'patient at risk', 'critical illness' and 'cardiopulmonary resuscitation'. Only English language references were included in the analysis.

Shorter training times reduce the expertise acquired through apprenticeship. The net effect is that sicker patients are receiving care from fewer and less experienced staff.

Error and quality in health care

]. Clinical error is now widely recognized as a systems problem; that is, adverse events affecting individual patients are usually caused by a sequence of events in the macro- and micro-environment that involve deficiencies in the structure and organization of health care, and are not simply a consequence of human error by the responsible clinician who is the terminal link in the chain. To improve safety and quality in health care requires a systems approach in which all participants – politicians, administrators and health care professionals – assume responsibility for patient outcomes. This ambitious task requires focusing of efforts on those patients most at risk.

] analyzed deaths within 30 days of a surgical procedure in elderly patients (>90 years), and found that suboptimal fluid management was a major cause of serious postoperative morbidity and mortality in this group. It recommended more accurate monitoring and recording of fluid balance and earlier recognition and correction of problems as a means of reducing the incidence of postoperative complications. The report also identified deficiencies in multidisciplinary care, despite the high incidence of comorbid disease in these elderly patients, and recommended more collaborative working between surgeons, anaesthetists and physicians with expertise in the care of the elderly.
This type of audit based on a large observational database is essential for identifying current practice and opportunities for improvement. However, recommendations were based on peer review and data from questionnaires provided by assessors who were unblinded to clinical outcomes, examining only those patients who died – there are no denominator data.

Cardiopulmonary arrest

] examined the case notes of 150 consecutive patients who had suffered a cardiac arrest on a general ward, and found documented prior clinical deterioration in 99 (66%). A common finding was the failure of the nurse to notify a physician of deterioration in the patient's condition.

] surveyed the use of 'do not resuscitate' orders in a community hospital in the UK and suggested that end-of-life care of dying patients and their families in hospital could be substantially improved in terms of symptom relief, communication and respect for the patients' wishes. They also concluded that poor decision making by health care workers could be improved by education. One consequence of a lack of communication between staff and a reluctance to discuss these difficult issues with patients and families is the inappropriate resuscitation and subsequent admission to the ICU of patients for whom further intervention would be futile and add to the burden of suffering.
A more appropriate approach to management of acutely ill patients at risk for critical illness or cardiac arrest would be to prevent these complications, or agree treatment goals and limitations, by earlier recognition of simple warning signs. We consider the various approaches that are being adopted below.



Systems for earlier recognition and management of patients at risk

Structures and processes for early intervention

] found that ward staff often lacked confidence and felt ill prepared to deal with acutely ill unstable patients, and that they experienced increased stress and anxiety. Such emotions are unlikely to enhance staff retention or reduce sickness rates. It therefore makes sense to put in place systems that improve the support not only of sick patients but also of the staff responsible for their care, and that reduce discontinuities in clinical care. The key to this is empowerment through adequate resourcing and training, and simple methods of clinical monitoring. Three models are currently employed: hospitalists in the USA, the MET in Australia, and outreach care in the UK.

Hospitalists
41
42
43
], although there clearly are opportunities for interaction. Hospitalists occupy a role that is close to that of the general physician in UK hospitals, except that the latter group often have a subspeciality.
This model is suited to the system of care in the USA, where primary care physicians often have continuing responsibility for inpatient care. It might also be of value to other health care systems in which increasing specialization is creating a need for generalist acute care clinicians in hospital practice.

Acute pain teams

16

Medical emergency teams

Critical care outreach
'Outreach' care is a systems approach for identifying and managing patients at risk of critical illness through collaborative care and education. Rather than providing a service through an external group, it aims to empower ward staff by offering them regular support, usually led by critical care trained nurses visiting the wards, with the facility to call on more expert assistance if required. Currently, critical care is seen as occurring within a defined environment (the ICU) and patients must achieve a certain level of severity of illness to merit admission. Outreach services facilitate a more flexible approach that is based on the needs of the patients and the skills and abilities of the ward staff.

], and the greater the degree of complexity, the more likely it is that errors or omissions will occur. Scoring systems for use in ordinary wards must be simple, and should direct attention to patients who need more intensive observation; they should be a trigger for investigation, not a precise tool for predicting individual patient outcomes. Thus, although physiological abnormalities may be unreliable predictors of the need for intensive care admission, they remain important stimuli for empowering staff to call for assistance in improving simple aspects of care of acutely ill patients.

Does earlier intervention improve outcome?
It may seem unnecessarily argumentative to suggest that something that is so evidently 'good' requires evaluation. Is it not self-evident that the earlier a life-threatening disease process is identified and treated, the better? This may be so, but complex systems – of which the acutely ill patient is one example – demonstrate sensitivity to initial conditions; that is, the outcome may be more difficult to predict with earlier application of an intervention. The outcome from cardiopulmonary resuscitation is well defined – a survival rate of around 10–15%, with death usually occurring when resuscitation attempts are discontinued. Is it not possible that earlier intervention that prevents cardiac arrest might result in delayed death following prolonged organ system support in the ICU, with the attendant suffering that this may cause? What is the cost–benefit of implementing the different models of care? Who will manage the process of discussing treatment goals or limitations with patients, and what do patients themselves feel about it?
Physiological goals

73
] conducted in surgical patients did not confirm this in terms of benefit from goal-directed therapy guided by pulmonary artery catheterization, perhaps because patients in the control group were already being optimally managed (and experienced a low overall mortality) as a result of improvements in clinical practice derived from earlier research.
74
75
77
]. It seems reasonable to conclude that using fluids and supplemental oxygen to optimize circulating volume, cardiac output and systemic oxygen delivery as early as possible in acutely ill hospitalized patients will tend to reduce the incidence and severity of organ dysfunction related to a systemic oxygen debt. These simple measures may need to be supplemented later by more complex interventions, but the ability to manage the initial phase of preventive care should be within the ability of most health care staff.

Clinical outcomes
62
63
] also demonstrated a marked reduction in cardiac arrest rates associated with the introduction of a MET, and a parallel reduction in the use of intensive care resources on cardiac arrest survivors. It seems likely, therefore, that hospitals with high ward based cardiac arrest rates may well benefit from the introduction of systems aimed at identifying and managing sick patients earlier. Further multicentre studies from Australia are awaited.

Autonomy and treatment limitation decisions
78
79
80
]. It is clear that discussions about treatment preferences must be conducted with sensitivity by staff with appropriate experience and training, who have had an opportunity to develop a relationship of trust with the patient. This mandates a collaborative approach between the various medical and nursing teams, the patient and the family. Early intervention may buy time for these complex discussions to take place and an appropriate decision to be made.


Changing behaviour through education and training
81

], and it is hoped that other disciplines will follow.
85
86
]. Important attitudinal attributes of outreach staff must therefore include the capacity to teach, learn from, and support other clinicians, sometimes under difficult circumstances.

Conclusion
There are substantial opportunities for improving the safety and quality of care delivered to acutely ill hospitalized patients. The methods which are adopted will vary according to local circumstance, but common elements include the need for better integration of care across disciplines and systems for earlier identification of patients at risk, and we refer to these as 'outreach' care. We do not yet know which of these various approaches will best improve patient outcomes, and there is a need for prospective studies in this area which take into account the difficulties of using randomization and controls, and which employ long-term follow-up. METs appear to reduce the incidence of cardiac arrests in ordinary wards, and consequential use of scarce intensive care resources. Outreach-based systems which support and educate ward-based staff in delivering clinical care appear to have achieved a high degree of acceptance in the UK. Health care managers need to work closely with clinicians to introduce these methods of team-working into hospital practice, while evaluating their effectiveness.
