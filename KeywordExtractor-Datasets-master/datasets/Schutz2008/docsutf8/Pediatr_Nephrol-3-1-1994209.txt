Congenital abnormalities of the kidney and urinary tract are frequently observed in children and represent a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. These conditions are phenotypically variable, often affecting several segments of the urinary tract simultaneously, making clinical classification and diagnosis difficult. Renal agenesis/hypoplasia and dysplasia account for a significant portion of these anomalies, and a genetic contribution to its cause is being increasingly recognized. Nevertheless, overlap between diseases and challenges in clinical diagnosis complicate studies attempting to discover new genes underlying this anomaly. Most of the insights in kidney development derive from studies in mouse models or from rare, syndromic forms of human developmental disorders of the kidney and urinary tract. The genes implicated have been shown to regulate the reciprocal induction between the ureteric bud and the metanephric mesenchyme. Strategies to find genes causing renal agenesis/hypoplasia and dysplasia vary depending on the characteristics of the study population available. The approaches range from candidate gene association or resequencing studies to traditional linkage studies, using outbred pedigrees or genetic isolates, to search for structural variation in the genome. Each of these strategies has advantages and pitfalls and some have led to significant discoveries in human disease. However, renal agenesis/hypoplasia and dysplasia still represents a challenge, both for the clinicians who attempt a precise diagnosis and for the geneticist who tries to unravel the genetic basis, and a better classification requires molecular definition to be retrospectively improved. The goal appears to be feasible with the large multicentric collaborative groups that share the same objectives and resources.

]. Even if this is in contrast with more recent data about the reciprocal interaction between the ureteric bud and the MM (see below), this classification can be clinically useful to partition patients with different types of urinary tract abnormalities. In this review, we focus on the malformations that primarily involve a reduction of renal parenchyma in the form of renal agenesis and/or hypoplasia/dysplasia, occurring both as isolated forms or in association with other malformations of the lower urinary tract (see below).
Primary renal agenesis

].

Primary renal hypoplasia and dysplasia
Strictly speaking, renal hypoplasia is defined as a small kidney, which contains intact nephrons that are reduced in number, whereas a dysplastic kidney contains disorganized elements and maldifferentiated tissue. Noninvasive imaging studies such as ultrasounds and dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan offer limited information to help distinguish a hypoplastic kidney from a dysplastic one. Unequivocal distinction between these two entities therefore depends on histological examination of renal tissue obtained from kidney biopsy or surgical nephrectomy, which are rarely performed. A further confounding factor is the reduction of kidney size due to chronic injury and scarring from VUR. Most of the time, a DMSA scan helps differentiate primary hypoplasia or dysplasia from small kidneys secondary to VUR. However, a DMSA scan has a low negative predictive value in distinguishing primary hypoplasia or dysplasia from a secondary reduction in kidney size from VUR when scars or areas of negative isotope uptake are present. In practice, the diagnosis of primary renal hypoplasia is favored when the following criteria are satisfied: (a) a reduction of renal size by 2 standard deviations (SDS) from the mean size for the age, (b) exclusion of renal scarring by DMSA scan, and (c) a presence of compensatory hypertrophy of the contralateral kidney. In all cases, the exclusion of renal cysts by ultrasonography is mandatory to avoid confusion with primary renal hypoplasia associated with fibrosis and cysts, nephronophthisis being the most pertinent example. The presence of VUR and/or ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO) does not automatically exclude the diagnosis of hypoplasia, as both conditions are frequently associated with primary renal-size defects. It is clear that this problem is difficult to resolve if the ureteral defect presents ipsilateral to renal hypoplasia. For example, severe antenatal hydronephrosis due to UPJO can determine the involution of the renal parenchyma and lead to an erroneous diagnosis of primary renal agenesis after birth. In bilateral cases, syndromic traits as well as inherited disorders such as medullary cystic kidney disease/nephronophthisis have to be excluded. Unequivocal exclusion of renal dysplasia is usually not feasible except in rare cases for which histology is available. It is possible that in the near future, molecular genetic advances could modify our present understanding and allow for a more direct separation of the two pathological entities based on laboratory tests.
These challenges in clinical diagnosis of renal hypoplasia complicate studies attempting to discover new genes underlying this anomaly. For research purposes, we utilize a tentative classification scheme for categorizing our subjects for genetic studies: (1) isolated bilateral hypoplasia/dysplasia, (2) isolated unilateral hypoplasia/dysplasia, and (3) hypoplasia/dysplasia associated with lower tract abnormalities such as VUR or UPJO. Once the genetic basis of different subsets of urinary tract malformations is identified, the classification will likely be retrospectively changed and improved.

The interdependence between developmental pathways explains why defects in different genes result in similar phenotypes and why morphologic classification of abnormalities alone cannot predict the location or nature of primary defects. Available data thus suggest a large list of candidate genes for human renal and urologic malformations, highlighting the potential for genetic heterogeneity of the trait.

Genetic contribution to human renal agenesis/hypoplasia and dysplasia
A genetic contribution to the development of renal hypoplasia/dysplasia has been recognized for many years. For the isolated, nonsyndromic renal agenesis/hypoplasia and dysplasia, only segregation studies have been performed, and no loci and/or genes have been mapped so far. Much more is known about rare syndromic forms, for which several genes have been already implicated.

]. Nevertheless, until recently, no linkage studies in familial renal agenesis/hypoplasia and dysplasia have been reported. Incomplete penetrance, variable expression and the fact that anatomical defects in many family members can be clinically silent, complicate recruitment of large pedigrees that would be suitable for linkage analysis.


Strategies for gene discovery
Strategies to find genes causing renal agenesis/hypoplasia and dysplasia vary significantly depending on the characteristics of the study population available. Different data sets of patients have potential advantages and possible pitfalls.

This study is an example of how an isolate can allow traits that display reduced penetrance and variable expressivity to express their genetic component and represent a first step to find genes causing or predisposing to such diseases. Further investigation of recognized population isolates for developmental disorders, especially renal agenesis/hypoplasia and dysplasia, might help to accelerate gene mapping.

Careful clinical selection of patients and application of genome-wide methods for searching structural variation in renal agenesis/hypoplasia and dysplasia can help find new loci linked to the disease, confirm and narrow loci obtained by linkage analysis, and speed up the discovery of causative genes.


Conclusions
Renal agenesis/hypoplasia and dysplasia still represents a challenge for both the clinicians who attempt a precise diagnosis and for the geneticists who try to unravel the genetic basis. Genetic and clinical approaches are now converging toward a common goal, which is the discovery of genetic markers, to make the diagnosis of this trait easier. The final objective is to improve classification, to make a reliable prognosis, and to attempt prevention. Based on advances from the last few years, the goal appears to be more feasible with large multicentric collaborative groups that share the same objectives and resources.
