Purpose
We have previously demonstrated in a pilot study of 348 invasive breast cancers that mast cell (MC) infiltrates within primary breast cancers are associated with a good prognosis. Our aim was to verify this finding in a larger cohort of invasive breast cancer patients and examine the relationship between the presence of MCs and other clinical and pathological features.

Experimental design
Clinically annotated tissue microarrays (TMAs) containing 4,444 cases were constructed and stained with c-Kit (CD-117) using standard immunoperoxidase techniques to identify and quantify MCs. For statistical analysis, we applied a split-sample validation technique. Breast cancer specific survival was analyzed by Kaplan–Meier [KM] method and log rank test was used to compare survival curves.

Results

Conclusions
This study concludes that stromal MC infiltration in invasive breast cancer is an independent good prognostic marker and reiterates the critical role of local inflammatory responses in breast cancer progression.

 (Dako Corporation, Carpinteria, CA) scoring system. Final Her2 score was derived using both IHC and Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) assays. Cases with Her2 IHC Herceptest score = 3, were scored as positive. Those cases with Her2 IHC Herceptest score = 2 were re-evaluated using FISH assay, and only those cases with Her2 FISH amplification ratio ≥2.0 were scored as Her2 positive. C-Kit and ER scores were binarized for statistical analysis as follows: CD-117: 0 = no MCs; 1 = any MCs; ER: 0 ≤ 1% nuclei stained; 1 ≥ 1% nuclei stained. We excluded cases for which it was not possible to assign a score to the immunostaining (insufficient invasive tumor in the core, or missing core).

X-tile analysis results
We assessed the association between patient outcome and number of positively stained MCs in the stroma of tumors using X-tile software. This software allowed us to define an optimal cut-off point that defined the number of MCs needed to predict good prognosis in the cancer patients. The program divided the population into low and high-risk groups based on the number of MCs detected. It converted continuous data into ordinal classes for statistical analysis. The X-tile plot showed that breast cancer patients with any number of stromal MCs had better prognosis compared to those who have no MC infiltration in their stroma. MCs ranging between 1 and 22 in the tumor stroma were present in 507 (27.61%) patients and were grouped together in the low population group of the training set. The high population group comprised of 1,329 (72.39%) patients in the training set. It reiterated the findings obtained by KM survival analysis that the presence of any number of stromal MCs predicts good prognosis in invasive breast cancer patients.

In conclusion, we confirm our earlier pilot study findings and confirm that stromal MCs correlate with a good prognosis in a large cohort of 4,444 invasive breast cancer patients with long-term follow-up. It highlights the critical role that the host stromal reaction, in particular the inflammatory cell infiltrate, plays in modulating cancer progression. MCs can be used as markers for risk stratification in invasive breast cancers.
