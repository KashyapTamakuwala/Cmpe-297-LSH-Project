Wegener’s granulomatosis (WG) frequently involves the subglottis and trachea and may compromise the upper airway. The objective of this study is to evaluate retrospectively the effect of treatment of subglottic stenosis (SGS) and tracheal stenosis (TS) by dilatation tracheoscopy (DT) in patients with WG. We performed a cohort study on all patients who underwent DT between February 2001 and September 2005 in our institution. From this cohort we identified a total of nine WG patients. In all patients, clinical, serological and histopathological data had been prospectively collected by a standardized protocol from the time point of diagnosis. In the nine patients that were identified with SGS or TS due to WG (eight women and one man), a total of 22 DT’s were performed. Two patients needed a tracheostoma (one temporarily). The mean follow-up after the first DT was 25.4 ± 14.1 months. Two patients did not experience a recurrence of SGS or TS. Six patients required a second DT without recurrence of local disease. The remaining patient underwent 8 DT's in a 4-year period. DT can offer a simple and repeatable solution to SGS and TS due to WG. Seven of the nine patients required more than one dilatation and some patients experience a functional restriction. One patient has a definitive tracheostoma.

]. This narrowing of the upper airway at the level of cricoid cartilage and/or upper tracheal rings presents a management dilemma. Dilatation tracheoscopy (DT) is one of the possible options for treatment of SGS and TS. The long-term effects of DT in patients with WG have never been reported.
DT is a minimally invasive self-standing procedure. It can be used for elective and emergency intervention in patients with subglottic and tracheal stenosis. This has been described elsewhere (G.B. Halmos, F.G. Dikkers, Dilatation tracheoscopy in treatment of subglottic and tracheal stenosis, submitted for publication). Patients suffering from WG present differences (age, sex, response to treatment) compared to other aetiologies, which justifies separate publication. The objective of this study is therefore to evaluate the effect of the treatment of SGS and TS by DT in patients with WG.

Methods
We retrospectively identified all patients from our institution that underwent a DT between February 2001 and September 2005. The total cohort of benign, grade II (Myer-Cotton) subglottic or tracheal stenosis consisted of patients with a history of posttraumatic tracheal stenosis, thermal tracheal stenosis, posttracheotomy cicatricial stenosis, tracheal rupture, postintubation stenosis, and WG, amongst others. As stated before, the cohort is described elsewhere.

The constellation of the tracheoscope is suitable for most grade II (Myer-Cotton) subglottic or tracheal stenosis. The intervention can be repeated after any time interval.
Typically, no antibiotics or corticosteroids are used. The use of mitomycin-C was considered in each case, but it was never used, because mitomycin-C should be used in fresh wounds. Patients are dismissed the day after DT. Peakflows were measured three times (Respironics Healthscan Inc., Cedar Groove, NJ, USA) in an upright position. The mean of the three measurements was taken.

, the number of relapses of WG varied between 0 and 12. There was no relation between the number of relapses and the occurrence of TS or SGS. In only one of the DT procedures there was endoscopic and/or histopathological evidence of vasculitis activity. The TS or SGS occurred in 95% in periods where the disease appeared to be less active.

Discussion
There are multiple causes of benign laryngeal or tracheal stenosis, the most common being traumatic. However, if there is no prior history of tracheal trauma, the aetiology of the stenosis may be obscure and difficult to determine, necessitating a systematic approach to make the diagnosis. Excluding trauma, the differential diagnosis of TS can be subdivided into four categories: congenital, neoplastic, infectious, and inflammatory.
Congenital TS is really quite rare and is often the result of posterior fusion of the tracheal rings, thereby forming complete rings. Other causes of congenital stenosis include vascular rings and other congenital cardiovascular anomalies such as an anomalous subclavian artery. These patients typically present at young age.
Primary benign tumours of the trachea such as chondromas, fibromas, squamous papillomas, hemangiomas, and granular cell tumours are also unusual causes of stenosis. In addition, extrinsic compression of the trachea can occur by thyroid neoplasms and goiters.
A number of infections of the bronchopulmonary tree can lead to TS. Fungal infections such as histoplasmosis and blastomycosis should always be considered when the aetiology of the stenosis is unclear. Serologic testing and histopathologic examination can be helpful in this regard. Other infectious causes of TS include rhinoscleroma, tuberculosis, syphilis, and diphtheria.
Non-infectious, inflammatory causes of TS include sclerosing mediastinitis, primary amyloidosis, and sarcoidosis. WG and relapsing polychondritis can also cause TS, but they are almost always seen in combination with other, more classic hallmarks of these diseases.
A laryngeal or tracheal stenosis is optimally diagnosed via tracheal visualization, which is generally performed by an otorhinolaryngologist. Indirect and fiberoptic laryngoscopy are non-invasive examination techniques that can be performed in the office, but usually do not show the entire trachea. A subglottic stenosis is not always visible, therefore direct rigid tracheoscopy in general anaesthesia is indicated in cases suspect of WG.

]. In our series, however, three patients had SGS or TS as presenting symptom of their WG. We do not have an explanation for this rare presentation.
Another particular finding is that eight of our nine patients were female. This contrasts significantly with the male/female ratio in the reference group that consisted of WG patients that were diagnosed in the same period as the DT group but who did not have evidence of SGS or TS. It is difficult to speculate on the reason for this female preponderance. Anatomically the female airway is narrower than the male, making it more prone for post-intubation stenosis. However, we even had females presenting with a SGS or TS. More research in larger series has to be performed to explain this phenomenon.

]. Notably, seven of our nine patients that underwent DT were PR3-ANCA positive and one patient was MPO-ANCA positive.
All patients had involvement of additional organs. In three patients the disease presented as a stenosis, and laryngotracheoscopy revealed the size and site of the lesion. Organs involved showed no pattern in which there should be additional suspicion for the development of SGS or TS. There was no relation between the number of relapses and the development of TS or SGS. The TS or SGS occurred more often in periods where the disease appeared to be less active.
Remarkably, TS or SGS predominantly became manifest in periods in which WG appeared to be inactive. Interestingly, seven out of our nine patients who developed TS or SGS had not been diagnosed previously with tracheal involvement of WG, neither at first presentation nor at relapse(s). We speculate that during active disease a subclinical tracheal involvement occurs which may subsequently heal with scar formation. To examine this hypothesis in patients, elective tracheoscopy should be performed in all patients with WG. The time interval between presentation of clinical stenosis in these seven patients (mean 63 months, median 60, range 2–122) favours watchful waiting.
DT with the Groningen dilatation tracheoscope is a safe, minimally invasive procedure for the treatment of Cotton-Myer grade II subglottic or tracheal stenosis of various origin. It is an elegant, self-standing surgical intervention, where no additional interventions are needed. For an overview of the effect of DT the reader is referred elsewhere (G.B. Halmos, F.G. Dikkers, Dilatation tracheoscopy in treatment of subglottic and tracheal stenosis, submitted for publication).

], is increasingly used as adjuvant treatment in the management of selected cases of laryngeal and tracheal stenosis, for example luminal obstruction in fresh circular sutured wounds. However, the laryngeal and tracheal stenoses of WG patients are almost always of older age and display advanced scarring at the time of diagnosis. Dilating such “mature” stenoses will inevitably lead to damage of tracheal epithelium. However, this damage is considerably different from granulomatous scarification in sutured lumina and, therefore, we do not expect an additional favourable response to mitomycin. Therefore, we have not applied mitomycin-C in our WG patient cohort.

-axis. Progressive complaints and progressive decline of peakflow values (+/+) indicate intervention by DT. Absence of progressive complaints and unchanged peakflow values (−/−) indicate watchful waiting. Absence of progressive complaints with decline of peakflow values (−/+) need to be addressed when the values reach a critical level, in which it can be expected that a common cold might lead to severe stenosis of the airways. Finally, progressive complaints with unchanged peakflow values (+/−) indicate that pulmonary function tests should be performed, and, if negative, indicate that the patient has an incorrect perception of his physical potentials. This can then be addressed. Unfortunately, in only five of the nine patients in this retrospective study, we have peak flow measurements. A reason is that two patients have or had a tracheostomy.
We have registered no complications or deaths during or because of DT. We have three reasons to regard dilatation tracheoscopy as a minimally invasive intervention. We have experienced no complications related to dilatation tracheoscopy. It requires short hospitalization (generally 3 days). The intervention is not straining for the patients.

Conclusion
WG as such is a rare disease, and SGS and TS are rare symptoms in patients with WG. DT can offer a simple and repeatable solution to this very serious symptom. Patient complaints and monitoring of peakflow values offer simple tools for the decision whether or not to intervene. However, a causative solution to WG should be the ultimate goal.
