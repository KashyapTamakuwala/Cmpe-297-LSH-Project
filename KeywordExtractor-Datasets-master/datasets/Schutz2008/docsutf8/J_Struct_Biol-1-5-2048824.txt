Abstract
Xenopus
Xenopus
 egg extracts, Rtn4a localises to the edges of membranes that are flattening onto the chromatin. These results demonstrate that Rtn4a locates to regions of high membrane curvature in the ER and the assembling NE. Previously it was shown that incubation of egg extracts with antibodies against Rtn4a caused ER to form into large vesicles instead of tubules. To test whether Rtn4a contributes to NE assembly, we added the same Rtn4a antibody to nuclear assembly reactions. Chromatin was enclosed by membranes containing nuclear pore complexes, but nuclei did not grow. Instead large sacs of ER membranes attached to, but did not integrate into the NE. It is possible therefore that Rtn4a may have a role in NE assembly.

). Therefore, we speculated that if the ER needs to be in a tubular form to contribute to NE growth and assembly then Rtn4a may have a role. First we asked whether Rtn4a is associated with membranes that are contributing to NE growth, and then we investigated whether Rtn4a might be required for NE assembly.
2.1
Rtn4a is located at inter-membrane junctions between cytoplasmic vesicles near the NE

j). These results show that Rtn4a locates to specific regions on NE associated cytoplasmic membranes.

2.2
Rtn4a is present on membranes attached to growing NEs
Fig. 2
Fig. 2
a is an image of the surface of a stage III NE showing NPCs, rough (ribosome-containing) vesicles (RV), smooth (ribosome-free) vesicles (SV), and rough membranes that appear to be flattening onto the ONM (FM). We see that there is labelling of the ONM and vesicles are labelled to a varying degree. Smooth vesicles are not labelled, whereas rough ER type vesicles are. This shows that Rtn4a is associated with some but not all membranes that are associated with the ONM of a growing NE.

2.3
Rtn4a localises to the junction between the ONM and membranes attached to it

Rtn4a localises to the edges of flattened membranes

). The preferred edge location suggests that Rtn4a tends to locate or accumulate at regions with the highest curvature. We conclude that Rtn4a marks the highly curved edges of flattened sheets of presumed ER membrane attached to the ONM.

). Although there are highly curved membranes in the nuclear pores we see no Rtn4a labelling there. The high membrane curvature at the NPC might be maintained by nucleoporins which could exclude the accumulation of Rtn4a, or it is possible that Rtn4a is present but not detected by the antibody due to epitope masking.

i, white arrows). The extensions are clearly continuous with the NPC-containing NE. Therefore, it appears that perturbing Rtn4a does not prevent enclosure of the chromatin by NE. However, the chromatin and NE do not expand despite the attachment of large ER-like sacs to the ONM. These sacs are similar to the large ER vesicle formed in the cytosol in the presence of the antibody, except they are attached to the NE.

Smeijers et al., 2006; Yang and Huang, 2002
). Rtn4a could be involved in stalk formation or stabilisation in certain NE membranes. We do not know if these membranes in oocytes are actively fusing membranes or if they are more stable or intermediate structures. Rtn4a could be involved in stabilising the conformation of these junctions by maintaining the high membrane curvature to facilitate membrane flow into the NE.

 experiments. As Rtn4a has been implicated in the formation of highly curved membrane regions, it is possible to speculate that Rtn4a is important for formation of flattened sheets, by stabilisation of the high curvature at the edge regions. However, this may be a non essential function in the initial stages of NE assembly, which occur in the presence of the antibody.

) and have a function related to membrane curvature. We have also observed that it locates to membrane junctions and other highly curved regions of membranes that may be involved in NE growth. Concordantly, an Rtn4a antibody perturbs NE growth. We therefore hypothesise that Rtn4a may have a role in maintaining functional ER–NE junctions during NE growth and/or the ER must be tubular to contribute to NE growth.

Both secondary electron images (for structure) and backscatter electron images (for gold label position) were collected simultaneously. Using Adobe Photoshop, the backscatter image was superimposed onto the secondary image as a separate layer. The positions of the gold particles were marked with a yellow dot and then the backscatter image removed.

Fig. 2
Immuno-gold labelling shows Rtn4a localises to NE associated membranes. (a) FeiSEM image of the surface of a stage III oocyte NE showing rough ribosome containing vesicles (RV), smooth vesicles (SV) and flattened membrane (FM). The position of anti-Rtn4a immuno-gold particles detected using a backscatter detector is indicated by circles. (b–d) Rtn4a localises to regions of contact between larger membrane structures and the ONM. (e) ER protein, ribophorin, has a more even distribution over flattened membranes, vesicles and the outer nuclear membrane.

Flattened membranes at the ONM of stage III oocyte. (a–c) Attached membranes with different inferred degrees of flattening: (a) is attached but not flattened; (b) is flattened with a few apparent points of fusion (arrows) and (c) is more integrated in the ONM and NPCs (arrowheads) are present around the edges (d–f) Immuno-gold labelling of Rtn4a in flattened membranes showing edge position of Rtn4a (circles). Scale bar in (c) refers to (a–c), scale bar in (f) refers to (d–f).



Fig. 4
Thin section TEM of NE with cytoplasmic membranes attached. Membranes may be continuous with the ONM (black arrows) or attached but apparently not continuous (white arrows).



Fig. 5
Rtn4a locates to the edges of flattened membranes. The average number of gold particles on each flattened membrane structure that are located less than 30 nm from the edge was compared to those located more than 30 nm from its edge. This was compared to the distribution of the ER protein, ribophorin. Bars represent standard error of the mean.

 egg extracts and labelled with antibodies to Rtn4a (a–c) or ribophorin (antibody CEL5C), marked by circles (d). (c) Fully assembled NE labelled for Rtn4a. (d) Quantification of gold labels for the two antibodies plotted as a distance from the edge. Scale bar in (d) refers to (b–d).

Xenopus
 egg extract. The antibody prevents the usual formation of ER tubules (a, arrows), instead forming large vesicles (b). In control nuclear assembly reactions (c) nuclei are large and roughly round, whereas in the presence of the antibody they remain sperm shaped with large membrane extensions (arrows) (d–g). (h) Nuclear growth is significantly retarded by the Rtn4a antibody as shown by quantification of the two-dimensional area of nuclei observed by feiSEM. (i) High magnification image of nucleus assembled in the presence of Rtn4a antibody, showing NPCs (black arrows) assembled on the sperm chromatin shaped region and the NPC-free ER-like extension with ribosomes (arrowheads). White arrows indicate the junction between the chromatin bound NE and the ER-like extension. Scale bar in (a) applies to (a and b). Scale bar in (f) applies to (c–g).
