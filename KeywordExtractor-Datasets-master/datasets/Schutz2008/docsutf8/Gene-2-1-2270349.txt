Abstract
Studies of both survival after sepsis and sperm motility in human populations have shown significant associations with common European mitochondrial DNA haplogroups, and have led to proposals that mitochondria bearing haplogroup H have different bioenergetic capacities than those bearing haplogroup T. However, the validity of such associations assumes that there are no non-random influences of nuclear genes or other factors. Here, we removed the effect of any differences in nuclear genes by constructing transmitochondrial cybrids harbouring mitochondria with either haplogroup H or haplogroup T in cultured A549 human lung carcinoma cells with identical nuclear backgrounds. We compared the bioenergetic capacities and coupling efficiencies of mitochondria isolated from these cells, and of mitochondria retained within the cells, as a critical experimental test of the hypothesis that these haplogroups affect mitochondrial bioenergetics. We found that there were no functionally-important bioenergetic differences between mitochondria bearing these haplogroups, using either isolated mitochondria or mitochondria within cells.

). Again, there have been no direct experimental tests of possible differences in the bioenergetic properties of mitochondria that might underlie the reported associations of haplogroup and phenotype.
In the present study, we analyse bioenergetic capacity and coupling efficiency in mitochondria isolated from cytoplasmic hybrids (cybrids) carrying haplogroups H and T with identical nuclear DNA. Furthermore, to investigate the effects of haplogroups H and T on the bioenergetic status of mitochondria at the cellular level, we analyse the respiratory capacities and mitochondrial coupling efficiencies of intact cybrids.

Coupling efficiency of respiration in intact cybrid cells

A shows that oxygen consumption was inhibited when ATP synthesis was prevented by addition of oligomycin, stimulated when oxidation was uncoupled from phosphorylation by addition of the uncoupler FCCP, and inhibited again when mitochondrial electron transport was abolished by addition of rotenone (to inhibit complex I of the electron transport chain) and myxothiazol (to inhibit complex III).
The residual rate in the presence of rotenone and myxothiazol represents non-mitochondrial oxygen consumption. This comprised 16.7 + 2% of basal respiration rate in H-haplotype cybrids and 18.2 + 2.7% in T-haplotype cybrids. These values were not significantly different. Subtraction of this non-mitochondrial respiration allowed assessment of the rates and coupling efficiency of the remaining mitochondrial respiration.

), so if haplogroup does affect mitochondrial bioenergetics, any effects must be very small. The lack of effect of haplogroup on mitochondrial coupling efficiency in intact cybrids shows that even if haplogroup affects mitochondrial proliferation or retrograde signalling, such changes do not affect coupling efficiency in the cells under basal conditions.
The strengths of our approach are (i) we used a direct empirical measurement, rather than inference from genetic and physiological traits, (ii) we separated the effects of mitochondrial haplogroup from any confounding effects of nuclear DNA background and (iii) we used a simple in vitro system with the powerful modular kinetic approach where the relevant variables could be tightly controlled and manipulated. However, our approach also has some weaknesses. (i) A small effect of mitochondrial haplogroup operating over hours or days might still be too small to be detected by biochemical experiments. (ii) We measured the bioenergetic capacity using isolated mitochondria and cybrid cells in simple defined media, but effects of mitochondrial haplogroups might only emerge under special conditions (for example, they might require triggers such as sepsis or energetic stress or might require particular nuclear genes to be expressed, and so be tissue-specific or suppressed in the lung carcinoma cell line we employed).
Our results fail to provide support for the hypothesis that the common European mitochondrial haplogroups H and T have significant effects on bioenergetics that cause the associations with survival after sepsis and sperm motility that have been reported. If such associations stand up to further scrutiny, they presumably operate through more subtle mechanisms than respiratory rates, mitochondrial coupling efficiencies or ATP supply.
