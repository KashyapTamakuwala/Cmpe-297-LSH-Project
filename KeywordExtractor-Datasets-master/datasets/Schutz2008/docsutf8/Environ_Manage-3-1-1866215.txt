 (plains cottonwood) seedlings relative to the water surface were qualitatively confirmed with respect to optimum locations. However, the extreme vertical range of water surface elevations produced cottonwood seed regeneration well outside the predicted limits of drawdown rate and height above late summer stage. The establishment and survival of cottonwood at high elevations and the differences between the upland plant community and the community that had developed after four years of exposure suggest that vegetation recovery following tall dam removal will follow a trajectory very different from a simple reversal of the response to dam construction, involving not only long time scales of establishment and growth of upland vegetation, but also possibly decades of persistence of legacy vegetation established during the reservoir to upland transition.

). In some cases, restoration of pre-dam vegetation may be a management goal. The extent to which this can be accomplished by natural colonization and subsequent vegetation change may significantly affect project costs. In some cases, natural colonization may be the default management action because of budgetary constraints, limited mandates, or lack of interest in restoration. Even in the absence of a specific restoration target for vegetation on the exposed surfaces, there are concerns about rapid dominance of these barren areas by undesirable, weedy, non-native species and the need to provide stabilizing vegetation to minimize erosion.

Methods
Field Sampling
We sampled vegetation along 13 transects that began 5 m into upland vegetation (above the reservoir’s high water mark of 1654.6 m above sea level) and extended down slope (perpendicular to the shoreline) to an elevation of 1621.5 m asl. Below 1621.5 m asl, the reservoir begins to separate into distinct pools with different water surface elevations. Transects were located randomly along the entire length of the shoreline, with the exception of the following excluded areas: small, shallow coves on the west side of the reservoir; the four dams; and 200 m on either side of each dam.

). Plots were spaced variably depending on the steepness of the slope so that they were evenly distributed along the elevational gradient. On steep slopes, a plot was sampled every meter; on progressively gentler slopes, plots were sampled at intervals of 2, 3, or 4 m in order to achieve as close as practicable to 3 plots per m of elevation change. Transect lengths ranged from 89 to 382 m. Following exclusion of plots without clear hydrologic history as described below, the numbers of plots analyzed per transect ranged from 80 to 142 with a total of 1,345 plots each year. The proportion of surface area at each plot that was occupied by cobble-sized particles or larger (>64 mm diameter) was estimated in the field. A single elevation of each plot was determined using a total station surveying instrument, registered to the water surface elevation and tied to the gage measuring long-term reservoir water levels. Substrate characteristics and topography were measured in 2001. General observations in 2002 suggested that there had been little change in substrate or topography between years.

Data Analysis
Plant characteristics and communities
Plant characteristics are summarized by elevational zone and sampling year with each combination denoted by the zone (BTM, MID, TOP, and UPL) subscripted by the last two digits of the year of sampling (2001 and 2002). The resulting eight zone-year combinations are grouped into classes based on the number of years since the zone was last exposed or drawn down (1, 2, 3, 4 years and Upland). There was no preexisting, rooted vegetation in any of these zones prior to their first exposure and no apparent survival of vegetation in the BTM zone between the two successive years it was drawn down.

Patterns in both species richness and cover were complicated by differences among sampling years in precipitation and among zones in substrate and sampled area. The second year of sampling, 2002, was drier than 2001, which contributed to lower total 2002 cover in the upland zone and lower numbers of identifiable species.

), but had not yet approached that of the surrounding upland plots.
The initial colonizing community of a bare surface might be expected to have higher fractions of short-lived and perhaps non-native species than later vegetation on the site. At the Horsetooth site, the fraction of perennials steadily increased through four years of exposure, whereas the fraction of native species was below that of the surrounding uplands and did not change appreciably or consistently. Substrate-adjusted mean values for total cover were lower than the upland and appeared to decline somewhat in the second through fourth years of exposure. A possible explanation for these patterns in cover and richness is that the mesic conditions in the first year of exposure produce a reasonably high plant cover composed heavily of annual species. This is followed by a period of reorganization, replacing annuals with deeper rooted perennials. Species richness peaks during this transition, whereas total cover tends to drop in the drier conditions of years two through four following exposure and only gradually increases to the ultimately higher cover of a slowly developing perennial community present on the dry upland sites.

). However, there was appreciable seedling establishment well outside the bounds predicted by the recruitment box model. Wave action, capillary rise, and plot heterogeneity in elevation are likely explanations for the substantial establishment in locations 0–1 m above the water’s edge. The establishment at much lower elevations as far as 5–6 m below the water’s edge on July 7 is more difficult to explain. It appears that the extreme drawdown rates created suitable bare moist sites far below the elevation of the optimum, but close enough to the period of maximum seed availability to allow some of the tail end of the distribution of germinable seed to establish.
Mahoney and Rood 1991
Mahoney and Rood (1998)
 discuss several factors that may support establishment at high elevations relative to the water’s edge including capillary rise, lateral subsurface water movement, and advantageous sequences of precipitation events. Given that some exposed surfaces at Horsetooth Reservoir were on the sides of sharp ridges with very limited contributing drainage area, we believe the most likely explanation for the high elevation establishment we observed is local variation in particle size and subsurface drainage (i.e., fine sediment in cracks between boulders) that create pockets of adequate moisture retained from inundation and channeled from rainwater-derived percolation.

), the exposed surfaces will be at elevations close to the surface of the new river and a large fraction of the exposed area would have been riparian or wetland before inundation. For tall dams and the drawdown case we report, the vast majority of the exposed land is pre-upland, not significantly influenced by a river before dam construction, substantially above the water surface following removal or exposure, and likely to support upland vegetation typical of the region.
There are two primary ways such a first approximation could be misleading. The first is that the post-dam topography and substrate characteristics may have been altered substantially by the period of inundation. This is especially true if the dam has accumulated substantial quantities of trapped sediment that have altered topography, stored nutrients or contaminants, or altered organic content or particle size distributions. Our results showed a significant effect of substrate size proportions on total vegetation cover; however, Horsetooth Reservoir was not accumulating substantial sediment because of the diversion source of most of the impounded water.

 is almost always associated with hydrologic disturbance and bare ground sites near the water’s edge, although mature trees can often persist on much drier sites. Thus, successful establishment of riparian cottonwood during the drawdown may leave a transient legacy of vegetation on the exposed reservoir surfaces that would be atypical of the sites either before reservoir construction or over the long term following dam removal. These patterns are very much a function of the specifics of reservoir drawdown and are thus potentially amenable to management as part of a dam removal. For example, cottonwood would be unlikely to colonize the bulk of pre-upland first-year exposure sites if the drawdown occurred in winter and the area was dry during the early summer period of seed release. On the other hand, the summer drawdowns observed at Horsetooth probably increased total plant cover on the exposed surfaces, which might be desirable from the perspective of erosion mitigation.
Menges and Waller 1983

). Effective weed control is complicated in the case of a tall dam. We observed a dramatic turnover of dominant species during the first four years and substantial changes in wetland character of the vegetation in response to drier site conditions. This suggests that (1) species-focused weed control will have to be maintained over multiple years with shifting targets as some of the weeds are diminishing naturally and being replaced by other species; and (2) planting of a desired or transition crop to preempt space and resources from invading weeds will have to consider rapidly changing site conditions to be effective in both the initial drawdown and immediately subsequent years.

) on sediment of the former reservoir pool may be suppressing the development of woody vegetation on shallow dam removal sites in Wisconsin. We saw little indication of this type of effect, as the dominant species continued to shift rapidly in the first four years of the Horsetooth Reservoir drawdown. However, the changes we observed in the first four years suggest that recovery of the vegetation community will be on the time scale of years to decades. Vegetative cover, composition of dominant species, and proportions of native and perennial species were still changing after four years and were substantially different from the upland community representing the likely long-term vegetation. Furthermore, the establishment and survival of cottonwood in the drawdown zone suggests that the particular nature of the transition from decades of continuous inundation to a xeric condition may leave a legacy signature in the vegetation community at least on the decades to century time scale corresponding to the lifespan of cottonwood.



The study was funded by the U.S. Geological Survey. B. Boaz, U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, provided reservoir water level data and logistical support. M. Caughlan (Larimer County), D. Fletcher (Lory State Park), and the Northern Colorado Water Conservancy District provided access to sites. J. Fleming, J. Knudson, and T. Sweanor assisted with field data collection and data management. The manuscript was improved substantially by comments from S. Rathburn, Z. Bowen, B. Keeland, S. Rood, and an anonymous reviewer.
