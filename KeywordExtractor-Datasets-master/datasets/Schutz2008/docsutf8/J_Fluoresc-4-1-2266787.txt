Experimental
Apparatus
The spectrofluorimetric measurements were recorded using ARF-1501 Shimadzu Spectrofluorometer, equipped with Xenon arc lamp.

Materials and reagents
Oxamniquine pure sample was kindly provided by Pfizer (Sandwich, UK).

Capsules containing 250 mg of Oxamniquine each (Vansil capsules) were obtained from commercial sources in the local market.

1-Dimethyl aminonaphthalene-5-sulphonyl chloride (dansyl chloride), purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, USA). A stock solution containing 0.1% of dansyl chloride was freshly prepared in acetone and was further diluted with the same solvent to obtain 0.001% solution.

Sodium carbonate (BDH, UK) 0.5 M aqueous solution (pH 10).

Sodium hydroxide (BDH, UK) 1 M aqueous solution.

Isobutylmethyl ketone (IBMK) (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany).

Plasma was kindly provided by Mansoura University Hospital, and kept frozen until assay after gentle thawing.

Methanol and diethyl ether (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany).




Standard solutions
A stock solution was prepared by dissolving 20.0 mg of OXM in 20 ml of acetone and 80 ml of 0.5 M sodium carbonate solution. This solution was further diluted with the same solvent mixture as appropriate. The standard solutions were stable for seven days when kept in the refrigerator.

. One molar NaOH (0.8 ml) was added to 1.0 ml of the spiked plasma and shaken genteelly. The solution was vortexed with 3 × 5 ml of diethylether for 2 min, then centrifuged at 2,500 rpm for 5 min. The resulting supernatant was evaporated to dryness under nitrogen at ambient temperature. The residue was dissolved and diluted to volume with a mixture of 5 ml of acetone and 20 ml of 0.5 M of sodium carbonate solution. Aliquots covering the working concentration range was transferred into 10 ml volumetric flasks. The recommended procedures were then applied. The nominal content of the drug was determined using the corresponding regression equation.

Optimization of experimental parameters
The spectrofluorimetric properties of the colored product as well as the different experimental parameters affecting the development of the reaction product and its stability were carefully studied and optimized. Such factors were changed individually while the others were kept constant. The factors include pH, concentration of the reagent, type of buffer, temperature, reaction time and dilution time.

]. The latter shows strong fluorescence and hence interferes seriously in the determination. However, under the proposed chosen conditions and wavelengths used, there was no interference arising from any dansyl hydroxide formed, as indicated by the low fluorescence intensity of the reagent.

Effect of diluting solvent
Different solvents were tried to dilute the reaction mixture through out the study. It was observed that isobutyl methyl ketone gave the highest fluorescence intensity. Dilution with 0.5 M sodium carbonate solution, water, acetone–water produced almost very week fluorescence and did not reduce the blank fluorescence intensity. While upon using isobutyl methyl ketone, the fluorescence intensity attained its highest value, this was attributed to the low fluorescence value of the reagent.

Robustness of the method
The robustness of the method adopted is demonstrated by the constancy of the fluorescence intensity with the deliberated minor changes in the experimental parameters such as change in the volume of dansyl chloride (0.001%), 0.7 ± 0.1 ml, the change in reaction time 35 ± 5 min and the change in dilution time 15 ± 5 min. These minor changes that may take place during the experimental operation didn’t affect the fluorescence intensity of the reaction product.


Pharmaceutical applications
The proposed methods were then applied to the determination of OXM in its capsules. The methods were tested for linearity, specificity, accuracy, repeatability and precision according to ICH Q2B recommendations.
Specificity
The specificity of the method was investigated by observing any interference encountered from the common capsule excepients, such as talc, lactose, starch, avisil, gelatine, and magnesium stearate. These excepients did not interfere with the proposed method.

Conclusion
The proposed method has the advantage of being simple, sensitive and suitable for routine analysis in quality control laboratory. Also, it is suitable for the determination of oxamniquine in spiked human plasma with minimum detection limit lower than the reported value. In addition, it could be applied to the determination of OXM in its pharmaceutical preparation.
