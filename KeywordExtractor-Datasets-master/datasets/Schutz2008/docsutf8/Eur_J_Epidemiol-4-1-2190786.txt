The Generation R Study is a population-based prospective cohort study from fetal life until young adulthood. The study is designed to identify early environmental and genetic causes of normal and abnormal growth, development and health from fetal life until young adulthood. In total, 9,778 mothers were enrolled in the study. Prenatal and postnatal data collection is conducted by physical examinations, questionnaires, interviews, ultrasound examinations and biological samples. Major efforts have been conducted for collecting biological specimens including DNA, blood for phenotypes and urine samples. In this paper, the collection, processing and storage of these biological specimens are described. Together with detailed phenotype measurements, these biological specimens form a unique resource for epidemiological studies focused on environmental exposures, genetic determinants and their interactions in relation to growth, health and development from fetal life onwards.

]. This data collection comprises also biological specimens including DNA, blood for phenotypes and urine samples. These biological specimens form the Generation R Study Biobank, which enables future epidemiological studies focused on environmental exposures, genetic determinants and their interactions in relation to growth, health and development from fetal life onwards. In this paper, the design, collection, processing and storage of these biological specimens in the prenatal phase of the study are described.

]. The partners were assessed once in pregnancy. All children form a prenatally recruited birth-cohort that is currently being followed until young adulthood.
Additionally, more detailed assessments of fetal and postnatal growth and development are conducted in a randomly selected subgroup of Dutch children and their parents, referred to as the Generation R Focus Cohort. Studies conducted in this subgroup examine etiological associations using more time-consuming methods that cannot be applied in the whole cohort.

Logistics
All biological samples were bar coded with a unique laboratory number. Blood or urine samples collected at one visit have the same bar code with an additional specific tube number. This combination forms a unique registration number. All following steps in processing, storing and data management of the samples are linked to this unique number.
All blood samples from the mother and partner were taken by research nurses and temporally stored at our research centre or one of the obstetric departments at room temperature for a maximum of 3 h. At least every 3 h, these blood samples were transported to a dedicated laboratory facility of the regional laboratory in Rotterdam, the Netherlands (STAR-MDC) for further processing and storage. Participants delivered their child either at home or at one of the hospitals in Rotterdam. The midwife or obstetrician collected cord blood samples. Subsequently, courier services with a 7-days and 24-h availability were responsible for transportation of these cord blood samples to our laboratory within 2 h.
After collection and transportation, all blood and urine samples have been centrally processed and stored at the STAR-MDC laboratory. Samples for DNA extraction have initially been stored as EDTA whole blood samples and subsequently transported to the Erasmus Medical Center for further processing.

]. Both the anonymous person unique study numbers and all sample numbers are registered which enables matching of each sample to a study subject. Also, picking and defrosting of samples in registered in Labosys. A back-up of this registration is available at the Erasmus Medical Center.

Number of eligible subjects reflects those participating in the study during pregnancy (DNA mother and partner) and visit our research centre in early, mid- or late pregnancy (plasma, serum and urine). The number of eligible subjects for urine sample collection is lower since this data-collection was added after starting the study. Number of eligible children reflects the number of live born children of mothers who were enrolled in the prenatal phase of the study with a known date of birth

DNA
For DNA extraction, one 10 ml EDTA tube from mothers, partners and children at birth have been collected and stored directly as whole blood sample at −80°C. After completion of the blood sample collection, DNA extraction was started from white blood cells. First, DNA extraction from all children has been conducted manually using the Qiagen FlexiGene Kit (Qiagen Hilden, Germany). Currently, DNA extraction from 5 ml whole blood samples from the mothers and partners is performed by a Hamilton STAR multi-channel robot using AGOWA magnetic bead technology (at 72 samples per run) and is expected to be finished in spring 2008.
Extracted DNA is automatically collected in stock tubes (2D Matrix, Micronic) that are organized in 96-wells format, but that can be individually addressed. These stock samples are split into two tubes that are stored at different locations. One of the stocks will then be used for normalising the DNA concentrations in 96 deep well (DW) plates. This protocol, as well as other manipulations of the DNA samples are performed on a Caliper ALH3000 pipetting robot (8/96/384 channels) with a Twister module and a 96/384 wells Tecan GENios plus UV reader. In total, 90 DNA samples are normalised per 96 DW plate with 6 water blancs per plate. Additionally, a random selection of 5% of the total number of samples are put into separate 96 DW plates, again with 6 blancs per plate, for control purposes. For normalisation, sample and diluent volumes are automatically calculated and produced to obtain equal DNA concentrations for all samples (25–50 ng/μl). From these stock 96-DW plates, 384 DW plates are created, which comprise 24 blancs each. Subsequently, replica PCR plates (384 wells) with a concentration of 1 ng/μl are created for genotype studies.
Stock 96-well plates (DW and 2D Matrix, Micronic) are stored at −20°C at two different locations within the Erasmus Medical Center (Genetic Epidemiology Laboratory, Genetic Laboratory Internal Medicine). The 384 DW stock and PCR plates are stored at the Genetic Laboratory Internal Medicine, Erasmus Medical Center. All genotyping studies with Generation R DNA material are performed in-house at the high throughput genotyping facility in this Laboratory.

]. Studies having a similar design and biological specimens collection include the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) in Bristol, UK, the Danish National Birth Cohort Study, the Norwegian mother and child Cohort Study, the Southampton Women’s Survey (SWS) in Southampton, UK and The National Children’s Study in the USA.
Collaboration with these studies for funding, standardization, replication and quality management is necessary. Currently, we are exploring possibilities for formal collaboration.

Requests for biological samples use
The study has an open policy with regard to collaboration with other research groups. Request for collaboration and use of biological specimens should primarily be pointed to Albert Hofman (a.hofman@erasmusmc.nl). These requests are discussed in the Generation R Study Management Team regarding their scientific merits, study aims, overlap with ongoing studies, logistic consequences and financial contributions.
General policy is that collaborating researchers and groups are responsible themselves for the finances and that all laboratory tests are conducted in the Eramus Medical Center, Rotterdam. After approval of the project by the Generation R Study Management Team and the Medical Ethical Committee of the Erasmus Medical Center, the collaborative research project is embedded in one of the four research areas supervised by the specific principal investigator.
