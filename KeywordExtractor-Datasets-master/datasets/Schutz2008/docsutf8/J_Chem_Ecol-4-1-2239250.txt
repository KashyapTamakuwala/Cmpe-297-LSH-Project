 and host performance was less clear. Plants in the Brassicaceae characteristically produce defense-related glucosinolates (GS). Levels of GS in leaves of undamaged plants were significantly higher in plants from the wild population than from the domesticated populations. Moreover, total GS concentrations increased significantly in wild plants after herbivory, but not in domesticated or feral plants. The results of this study reveal that a cabbage cultivar and plants from a wild cabbage population exhibit significant differences in quality in terms of their effects on the growth and development of insect herbivores and their natural enemies. Although cultivated plants have proved to be model systems in agroecology, we argue that some caution should be applied to evolutionary explanations derived from studies on domesticated plants, unless some knowledge exists on the history of the system under investigation.

). Most importantly, in wild plants, defense mechanisms have not been constrained by the “directional selection” that characterizes many crop plants. Therefore, to understand the evolution of plant defenses against insect herbivores, multitrophic interactions should also be studied in wild conspecifics of the cultivated plant species where plant defenses are the likely result of a range of biotic and abiotic selection pressures.

The different GS were identified based on their retention times, and UV spectra were compared to those of pure compounds (sinigrin, Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA; glucotropaeolin and glucobrassicin were kindly provided by M. Reichelt, Max Planck Institute for Chemical Ecology, Jena, Germany), or compared to a certified oil seed reference (EC Community Bureau of Reference BCR-367R, Fluka, Buchs, Switzerland).

Plants of the same population that received the same insect treatment were placed together, and caterpillars were allowed to develop and move around freely on plants until they reached the final instar. Different herbivore treatments were randomly positioned in a greenhouse, but were all placed in a similar position relative to the light sources to minimize microclimatic differences among plant populations and treatments.

, more than 150 adult moths were released with a 50:50 sex ratio in a plastic cage (37 × 40 × 30 cm). Folded strips of Parafilm served as substrate for females to lay eggs on. Females were allowed to oviposit on the Parafilm overnight. Subsequently, the strips with eggs were incubated for 4 d at 22°C until the eggs hatched. Pieces of Parafilm with neonate larvae were placed on top of individual plants of each of the three plant populations. Larvae were allowed to feed on these plants until they reached the third instar (L3).

 host. A host was considered as parasitized when the female wasp was observed to insert into and remove her ovipositor from the larva. Individual female wasps were allowed to oviposit in up to 10 separate hosts. After this, they were removed. Parasitized larvae were transferred to new plants of the same population on which the larvae had fed previously. Five plants were used for the unparasitized controls and nine for each of the parasitoid treatments. The number of plants provided ample food for all larvae to complete their development.

 Neonate larvae were obtained from the general culture and transferred to seven plants of each population with a distribution of six larvae per plant. When larvae had developed into L5, they were transferred to plastic containers that contained some leaf material from the plants they had fed on previously. After pupation, pupae were collected and placed in new plastic containers lined with filter paper. At adult emergence, the time of eclosion and sex were recorded, and the individuals were killed by freezing, followed by dry mass determination (as above). Containers with pupae ready to emerge were checked every 2 hr. Development time was measured in full days, as the exact time of oviposition had not been recorded.

 larvae were collected from the three populations, counted, and transferred to plastic containers (15 × 12 × 6 cm) that contained 2 cm of potting soil mixed with vermiculite (1:1) and some leaf material from the plant on which they had been feeding previously. After the larvae had pupated, they were collected and placed in new plastic containers filled with a layer of vermiculite. At moth emergence, the date of eclosion was recorded, and the individuals were killed by freezing, followed by dry mass determination. Containers with pupae ready to emerge were checked every 2 h. Development was measured in full days as the exact time of oviposition had not been recorded.

When the main factors or their interactions were significant, specific linear contrasts were applied to separate further factor levels. When necessary, correction for unbalanced sample sizes was carried out by using the Satterthwaite correction. Analysis was carried out with SAS 8.02 (1999–2001 ©SAS Institute, Inc).

). The most striking differences in GS concentrations were observed after induction by herbivore feeding, especially in the wild population. In wild plants, total GS concentrations were 1.7 times higher in induced plants than in uninduced conspecific plants, and were 2.7 and 4.9 times higher after herbivory than in induced plants of the cultivated and feral population, respectively. By contrast, the total GS concentrations in induced plants remained at the same level as in undamaged plants in the cultivated and feral populations, although differences were found for levels of individual compounds.

. The identity of the food plant and the degree of specialization exhibited by the herbivores and their parasitoids influenced the degree to which plant population affected performance. Most importantly, these results demonstrate that artificial selection in which certain plant traits are accentuated at the expense of others can alter a significant part of a plant’s evolved physiology. This may in turn have large impacts on insect communities that are associated with these plants. In wild plants, defense mechanisms have evolved under natural selection pressures from herbivores and pathogens and by the effects of natural enemies on herbivore populations. The reduction of the levels of direct defenses in cultivated plants could partly explain why these plants have often become more susceptible to attack from a wide range of herbivores and pathogens. To better understand the relative contribution of insect herbivory as a selective agent on the evolution of plant defenses, these traits should be studied in wild populations in which defense mechanisms have not been constrained by the “directional selection” that characterizes many species of crop plants. Future studies should examine insect communities associated with plant populations, including cultivars that differ in resistance against insect herbivores in plots in which the structural heterogeneity is also manipulated. This will facilitate a better understanding of the role that artificial selection has played in shaping the structure of communities associated with cropping systems.
