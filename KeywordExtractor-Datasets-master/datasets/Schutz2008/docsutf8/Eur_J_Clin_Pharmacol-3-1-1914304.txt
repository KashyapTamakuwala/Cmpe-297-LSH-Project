Objective
Hypothermia is an adverse drug reaction (ADR) of antipsychotic drug (APD) use. Risk factors for hypothermia in ADP users are unknown. We studied which risk factors for hypothermia can be identified based on case reports.

Method
Case reports of hypothermia in APD-users found in PUBMED or EMBASE were searched for risk factors. The WHO international database for Adverse Drug Reactions was searched for reports of hypothermia and APD use.

Results
n
 = 524). Hypothermia risk seems to be increased in the first days following start or dose increase of APs. APs with strong 5-HT2 antagonism seem to be more involved in hypothermia; 55% of hypothermia reports are for atypical antipsychotics. Schizophrenia was the most prevalent diagnosis in the case reports.

Conclusion
Especially in admitted patients who are not able to control their own environment or physical status, frequent measurements of body temperature (with a thermometer that can measure low body temperatures) must be performed in order to detect developing hypothermia.

Introduction
1
].
The hypothermic effects of APDs seem less well known than the hyperthermic effects (e.g., malignant neuroleptic syndrome). Besides occasional case reports, little emphasis has been placed in scientific literature on hypothermia as adverse drug reaction (ADR). To our knowledge, a review of all reported and published cases of antipsychotic associated hypothermia has not yet been published.

Methods
The WHO international database for Adverse Drug Reactions was searched for reports of hypothermia and APD use (ATC-code N05A, with exclusion of lithium). The data in the database are collected from 77 countries participating in the WHO Program for International Drug Monitoring. This database comprises more than 3.5 million case reports, to which around 50,000 new reports are added quarterly. The relationship between the APD and hypothermia is evaluated by calculating the Reporting Odds Ratios (RORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) in a case/non-case design. The ROR compares the frequency of the reported ADR for a certain drug with the frequency of reports of that adverse drug reaction for all other drugs in the database. Reports concerning hypothermia were considered as cases, all other reports as non-cases. Index reports included all reports on an APD (ATC code beginning with N05A, with exclusion of lithium), all other reports were controls. When the number of reports of hypothermia in association with the APD is high and the number of reports of hypothermia in association with other drugs is low, ROR will be high. This also happens when the number of reports of other ADRs in association with the APD is low and the number of reports of other ADRs in association with other drugs is low. Since the vast majority of cases in the WHO database do not contain any details on indication of drug use, start and/or end dates and outcome, these factors cannot be analyzed with data from the WHO database. To get more information regarding characteristics of patients developing hypothermia during APD use, we performed a literature search in Medline and Embase for case reports with search terms “(antipsychotic OR neuroleptic) AND (hypothermia OR body temperature regulation), with no selection on date or language. From these articles, we searched the references for missing articles. Two reviewers judged all case reports. All relevant case reports were studied for patient, drug and environmental characteristics.

]. Normally, a cold environment will result in behavior aimed at protection against the cold (taking extra blankets or clothes). APDs, however, will induce apathy and indifference, resulting in unawareness of developing hypothermia. Since some case reports also mention the co-existence of infections at the time of development of hypothermia, this may also play a role in the dysregulation of thermal homeostasis.

].
The results of this study should alert physicians of the risk of hypothermia in psychiatric patients using APDs. There seems to be no direct relation between stable drug dose and the ADR; the period shortly after starting the APD or dose increase seems to be the high risk period. Often, drug changes are indicated by behavioral problems also leading to separation or isolation of the patient. In the case of separation, patients will be dressed lightly and, even at normal room temperature, can cool down easily. In these cases, the patient’s body temperature should be monitored daily (with a thermometer that can measure low body temperatures). Also, every change in behaviour or co-morbidity (e.g., infections) should be a warning sign to look for hypothermia.
