]. Over the subsequent eight decades much has been written about the histologic features and clinical characteristics of patients with FSGS, but it is only in recent years that attention has been directed to the incidence and prevalence of the disorder in various populations. This article will provide an overview of the epidemiology of FSGS by reviewing published surveys of renal biopsies, experiences from clinical registries of children with renal insufficiency, and data from the U.S. Renal Data Systems (USRDS).

]. Since the diagnosis of FSGS depends on obtaining renal histologic material, the observed incidence and demographics of FSGS in both children and adults depend on the population examined and on the indications used for renal biopsy. The typical findings on renal biopsy in idiopathic FSGS are described elsewhere in this series of articles.

, it has been shown that FSGS carries the highest likelihood of progressing to end-stage renal disease (ESRD), exceeding the risk of hypoplasia, obstructive uropathy, and reflux nephropathy. According to NAPRTCS data, nearly 60% of such children with a diagnosis of FSGS progress to dialysis or transplantation within 24 months of entry into the registry. However, because reporting is entirely voluntary and involves mainly pediatric centers, there is significant underreporting, and selection bias may exist.

]. Although more data are needed, it is likely that mutations in the known FSGS causative genes account for only a minority of cases of FSGS in children and adults. A more complete review of the genetic aspects of FSGS is provided elsewhere in this series of articles.

Conclusion
It is clear that there is still much to learn about the epidemiology of idiopathic FSGS. However, there are encouraging signs that the body of knowledge will be enhanced in coming years by the various registries and population-based studies currently underway.

Questions
Patients with idiopathic FSGS often present with microscopic hematuria without proteinuria.

All patients with FSGS have nephrotic range proteinuria.

Patients with FSGS have proteinuria of varying severity.

None of the above.




Male gender.

Persistent proteinuria after therapy.

Hyperlipidemia.

Caucasian race.

Age.




Accurate data concerning the outcome of patients with FSGS is lacking since the disease was first described only 30 years ago.

The incidence of the disease appears to be decreasing in the last 20 years.

Most cases of FSGS can now be linked to specific gene mutations that disturb podocyte function.

All of the above.

None of the above.




FSGS is a more frequent cause of ESRD in Caucasian children than in African-American children.

FSGS is more commonly associated with nephrotic syndrome in Hispanic children than in white children.

Children with FSGS account for less than 10% of African-American children who progress to ESRD.

All of the above.

None of the above.
