Predicting physically associated proteins from patterns of conserved co-expression

). We then compared the correlation in mRNA expression of each pair of human genes with the correlations in expression of each of their corresponding ortholog pairs from five organisms, in all calculating mRNA expression correlations for 5 708 925 human gene pairs on the basis of 3977 DNA microarrays. After removing 105 140 gene pairs likely to cross-hybridize on the microarrays (see Materials and methods) and filtering pairs with nonsignificant correlations, we employed a supervised algorithm on these data to identify those patterns of conserved co-expression (CCE) diagnostic of physical protein associations, based upon the correlations observed for known protein interactions versus random protein pairs. By searching for additional gene pairs exhibiting these patterns, we identified new associations.

. These learned relationships between mRNA expression profiles and physical associations were then applied to protein pairs not in the training set, thereby assigning a likelihood of physically associating to each untested protein pair. Each human gene pair discovered has at least one log likelihood score, to a maximum of five, from which the highest score was identified; pairs were ranked based on this score, then evaluated as a function of their rank.

Validation of predicted physical protein associations by mass spectrometry

). As proteins in the same complex should generally co-sediment, we expected physically associated proteins to often have correlated elution profiles.
Figure 4C
Supplementary Figures 3–5

, 2001
); this association is clearly evident in the co-elution of GRIM-19 with other components of this complex.
et al
, 2005
Figure 5
Figure 6A
Figure 5
). Thus, correlated elution across these fractions is a strong indicator of direct physical association. As this assay is not used independently for discovery, but is confirmatory in nature, the false-negative and true-positive rates are sufficient for evaluating CCE associations.

). The CCE associations, supported by mass spectrometry, suggest direct physical association of RBBP4 with the replication initiation complex as well.
Figure 6B
et al
, 1992

Quantitative estimates of interaction accuracy

 shows the resulting standard curve that relates enrichment for orthologous interactions to percentage of true physical associations. On the basis of standard curve, we estimated that ∼37–41% of the CCE pairs correspond to true physical associations, somewhat lower than the value by mass spectrometry co-sedimentation but considerably higher than both randomized pairs and pairs derived from only human co-expression data.
et al
, 2002
et al
, 2006
Figure 7C
). For each control set, we measured the average keyword overlap across 882 SwissProt keywords between the interaction partners. Keyword overlap varied from ∼5% for the true-negative set to ∼42% for the true-positive set. From this curve and measurements of the keyword overlap by the 7000 interactions, we estimate ∼59–68% of the CCE set represent physical associations. Measurements of the percentage overlap of GO ‘biological process' and KEGG pathway annotations result in comparable values (∼50–53%).

Therefore, as expected, both direct binding and co-complex interactions can be found among the 7000 associations.

Limitations, false positives, and potential improvements
et al
, 2002
), and we expect CCE pairs to reflect this trend, with a correspondingly higher false-negative rate for transient interactions. Second, based on our measured error rates, there are still appreciable false-positive associations, although the false-positive and -negative error rates are comparable to the only direct experimental approaches—yeast two-hybrid assays and mass spectrometry of cloned, epitope-tagged human proteins—that have been applied to map physical associations on this scale. However, CCE false positives have unusual properties. As the CCE pairs were the highest scoring (top 0.1%) of >5 million tested gene pairs, the association partners are strongly co-regulated in an evolutionarily conserved manner, and thus are highly likely to function together, even if not physically associated. Finally, algorithmic improvements, such as better orthology assignment and alternative supervised learning frameworks, and application to additional DNA microarray data, e.g. tissue- and cell-type-specific data to learn tissue- and cell-type-specific associations, are certain to reveal new associations when applied in the general framework we have described. Thus, we expect new CCE associations can be identified by modifications to this method.
Similarly, the mass spectrometry data used to test the CCE associations have some important features and limitations. Primarily, co-sedimentation alone is not proof of physical association—it is possible for unrelated complexes to co-sediment—as reflected in the measured true-positive and false-negative rates for associations inferred solely from these data. These sedimentation-derived associations should thus not be viewed as standalone. However, as a benchmark applied in the manner we present (e.g. analyzed in aggregate form), or when considered in combination with other data, such as incorporated into the BIOS scores of the CCE associations, we find the mass spectrometry data to be extremely valuable. We suggest that benchmarks of this sort could be of great utility for evaluating physical complexes determined by other methods, and could be generally adopted for measuring assay accuracy.

We therefore divided the available 1922 human DNA microarray experiments into 11 categories of experiments, as assigned by the Stanford Microarray Database, and restricted comparisons to experiments in the same category. Expression data for other organisms were treated as single categories. Each of the microarray expression vectors was mean centered (row and column) and normalized before carrying out correlation analysis.

 and DNA sequence identity ⩾70% within the aligned regions. Gene pairs that exceed this threshold (with either the human or model organism gene pair DNA sequences) were likely to cross-hybridize and were excluded from further analysis. This filter removes 47 145 protein pairs from the plant–human analysis, 37 519 from the worm–human, 26 724 from the fly–human, 39 286 from the mouse–human, and 2193 from the yeast–human analysis. This filtration preferentially removes many false-positive interactions, as the average expression correlation of the filtered pairs was significantly higher than for the remaining pairs (e.g. the average expression correlation in the human–plant analysis was 0.28, while the average for the filtered pairs was 0.56), with the maximum expression correlation among the removed pairs equal to 1.0 for all comparisons.

.
The human-only co-expression control set was generated by considering only the human DNA microarray data, ignoring contributions from other organisms and lifting the requirement for each member of a gene pair to have orthologs in the same second organism. Putative associations were identified as for the CCE case, but instead using the log likelihood framework to relate the correlation coefficients across only the human DNA microarray experiments to the likelihood of physically associating. All other calculations were performed identically to the CCE case, including calculation of correlation coefficients, significance testing of correlations, calculation of likelihood values, selection of priors, and filtration for cross-hybridization.

Testing for functional similarity

). These databases provide specific pathway and biological process annotations for 7390 human genes, assigning them into 155 KEGG pathways (at the lowest level of KEGG) and 1356 GO pathways (at level 8 of the GO biological process annotation). Interactions were first rank-ordered by confidence scores. For each successive bin of 1000 interactions, the functional similarity was calculated in a cumulative manner by counting the number of pairs in that bin or previous bins that shared a functional annotation, dividing this by the number of pairs that did not share functional annotation, and correcting by the prior probability of annotated pairs sharing annotation (0.0589).

Figure 1
Overview of the analysis. From gene expression data for pairs of human genes and their orthologs, we identify proteins most likely to physically associate. For each pair of human genes, we compare the correlation in their mRNA expression patterns with the correlation in expression of their corresponding ortholog pairs, searching for patterns of conserved co-expression strongly enriched among physically associated proteins. By filtering the data to remove spurious associations (e.g. from microarray cross-hybridization and non-conserved expression regulation) and testing the associations against known human protein interactions and annotations, we predict 7000 human physical protein associations.

As in (A), CCE associations are comparable in quality to literature associations and score significantly higher than randomized associations and those derived using only human expression data.

) that are also identified in the mass spectrometry experiments, then calculating the percentage of these protein pairs belonging to the same Reactome complex as a function of the correlation in their elution profiles. With increasing correlation, we observe strongly increasing probability of belonging to the same physical protein complex. Proteins with the most correlated elution profiles across the 28 experiments are ∼40% likely to belong to the same protein complex.

). The distances between yeast orthologs of interacting human proteins were measured in the yeast network as the minimum number of interactions separating each pair of proteins. The resulting histogram of distances is plotted for each association set tested and for positive and negative control sets. Note that the distribution from CCE associations resembles the positive control set. The percentage of true and false positives in the CCE associations was estimated by fitting the distribution as a linear mixture of the positive and negative distributions (inset), minimizing the least squares criterion (r.m.s.d.; root mean square deviation); 63±3% of the 7000 CCE associations correspond to true physical associations by this test. Shuffling the interactions among the same proteins lowers the accuracy to 6±3% by this test. Error bars on the randomized association set indicate ±1 s.d. for N=10 random trials.
