Background
Since the introduction of the sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy in breast cancer patients there is a renewed interest in lymphatic drainage to the internal mammary (IM) chain nodes. We evaluated the frequency of lymphatic drainage to the IM chain, the rate of SLNs that contain metastases and the clinical implications of IM LN metastases.

Methods
Between June 1999 and April 2005 506 consecutive patients underwent SLN biopsy as a staging procedure for clinically T1-2N0 breast cancer. In all patients preoperative lymphoscintigraphy was combined with the intraoperative use of a gammaprobe. In patients with IM SLNs visualized on lymphoscintigraphy, LNs were extirpated through an intercostal parasternal incision.

Results
P
 < 0.001). In 17 patients IM metastases led to extension of the radiotherapy field, while additional (adjuvant) systemic therapy was given in six patients.

Conclusion
SLNs in the IM chain are common in breast cancer patients and can be extirpated in the majority of these patients. The proportion of patients in whom radiotherapeutic treatment was adjusted due to IM LN metastases was substantial. We advocate retrieval of IM SLNs when visualized by preoperative lymphoscintigraphy.

 but the clinical implications of IM LN biopsy are still unclear.
In this study we evaluated the frequency of lymphatic drainage to the IM chain, the rate of metastases in the IM SLN and the clinical implications of IM LN metastases.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Between June 1999 and April 2005, 523 consecutive patients underwent surgical treatment including SLN biopsy as a staging procedure for clinically stage T1-2N0 breast cancer. Data regarding all procedures were collected prospectively in a database of the nuclear medicine department.
A diagnosis of invasive breast cancer was established preoperatively by fine-needle aspiration or image-guided large core needle biopsy. Sixteen patients who underwent SLN biopsy as a secondary operative procedure following previous excisional biopsy of the primary tumor and one patient who eventually turned out to have multicentric breast cancer were excluded from the study.
The study cohort consisted of 506 patients. At the time of the introduction of the sentinel node procedure the ethical committee of the hospital approved the routine use of the SLN biopsy as a staging procedure. All patients received written information regarding the SLN procedure and the possibility of SLNs in the IM chain. The unknown clinical implications of surgically removing IM LNs were discussed with the patients.
99m
Tc nanocolloid in a total volume of 0.6 ml of physiologic saline, given in two to three equal doses. In case of a nonpalpable breast tumor the tracer was injected around the tumor using a 7.5-MHz ultrasound probe (Aloka). After injection the area was massaged until the appearance of the SLN. Continuous visualization was done and imaging started as soon as lymphatic drainage was visualized on the persistence scope and at 2–3 h after injection in both the anterior and lateral direction. Images were obtained during a 2-min imaging time on the Toshiba 901 HG single-head gamma camera, using low-energy high-resolution collimators. A skin marker was placed on the projection of the SN using a handheld γ-ray detection probe (Europrobe, PI Medical diagnostic equipment BV).
99m
Tc nanocolloid injection. A γ-ray detection probe and a peritumoral injection of patent blue dye (Bleu patenté V, Laboratoire Guerbet, Aulnay-sous-Bois, France) were intraoperatively used for SLN identification. During the operation axillary sentinel nodes were retrieved first and frozen section analysis was done to enable axillary dissection during the same operative procedure in case of LN metastases. When no axillary SLN was visualized on preoperative lymphoscintigraphy, the axilla was nonetheless explored in search for a blue dye containing SLN. When no axillary SLN was identified by either means, axillary LN dissection was performed. Following retrieval of axillary SLNs, surgical exploration for IM SLNs was done. When an IM SLN was visualized on preoperative lymphoscintigraphy, the γ-ray detection probe was used to guide a parasternal intercostal incision through the best-suited intercostal space to harvest the visualized node. A partial rib resection was not routinely done for sentinel IM nodes that were localized behind the ribs.

To assess the additional operative time of IM SLN biopsy we compared the time between incision and skin closure needed for lumpectomy and mastectomy with and without IM SLN biopsy. We selected four groups of ten patients: those who underwent lumpectomy with or without IM SLN biopsy and those who had had mastectomy with or without IM SLN biopsy. In all patients the operative procedure had started with axillary SLN biopsy. We only evaluated patients who did not have axillary dissection to avoid the potential bias of extra time awaiting the result of frozen section analysis. For each category we selected the last ten patients to avoid the learning curve effect.

Chi-square analysis was performed to evaluate differences in IM SLN visualization rates between groups of patients with various clinicopathological variables and to explore the relation between IM and axillary LN metastases. The ANOVA test was used to explore the relation between age and the visualization of IM SLNs, as well as for the analysis of operative time differences.

In 3 of the 20 patients axillary tumor load (≥4 tumor-positive lymph nodes) was a reason for locoregional radiotherapy including the IM lymphatic chain, leaving 17 patients in whom the radiotherapy field was adjusted because of metastases in the IM SLN. These 17 patients in whom the radiotherapeutic strategy was changed made up 20% of the patients in whom IM sentinel nodes were visualized.
Conversely, there were three patients with ≥4 axillary metastases and IM SLNs without metastases, and in these patients parasternal irradiation was omitted. In addition, parasternal irradiation could also be omitted in 30 patients with ≥4 axillary metastases who had no IM lymphatic drainage on preoperative lymphoscintigraphy.


DISCUSSION
In the present study, SLNs in the IM chain were visualized in approximately one-fifth of the patients who underwent surgery for primary breast cancer. Retrieving these nodes by parasternal intercostal exploration was feasible in the majority of patients. One-fifth of the retrieved IM LNs contained metastases and radiation treatment was adjusted in most of these patients.

 We consider patients with IM metastases at risk for locoregional recurrence and therefore feel that parasternal irradiation is indicated in patients with IM metastases. Conversely, absence of IM lymphatic drainage or metastases in retrieved IM SLNs justified omission of parasternal radiotherapy in 7% of all the patients.
3
 patients with IM and axillary metastases might need different chemotherapy schedules. That would increase the proportion of patients in whom adjuvant systemic treatment would be adjusted.
10
 We feel that the group of patients with visualized SLNs should be taken as a reference, and that the proportion of patients in whom less radiotherapy was given should also be taken into account. As a consequence, we do consider the clinical implications of IM SLN biopsy substantial.
In conclusion, lymphatic drainage of breast cancer to IM LNs is a common feature and retrieving these nodes is relatively easy. The clinical impact of metastases in IM lymph nodes is substantial and justifies surgical exploration for these nodes. We advocate routine parasternal intercostal exploration for IM SLNs whenever preoperative lymphoscintigraphy visualizes IM SLNs. For that purpose we also advocate the (additional) intraparenchymatous tracer injection to optimize the visualization of IM SLNs.
