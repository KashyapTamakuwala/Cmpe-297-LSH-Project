Thrombin-related peptide 508 (TP508) accelerates bone regeneration during distraction osteogenesis (DO). We have examined the effect of TP508 on bone regeneration during DO by immunolocalization of Runx2 protein, a marker of osteoblast differentiation, and of osteopontin (OPN) and bone sialoprotein (BSP), two late markers of the osteoblast lineage. Distraction was performed in tibiae of rabbits over a period of 6 days. TP508 (30 or 300 μg) or vehicle was injected into the distraction gap at the beginning and end of the distraction period. Two weeks after active distraction, tissue samples were harvested and processed for immunohistochemical analysis. We also tested the in vitro effect of TP508 on Runx2 mRNA expression in osteoblast-like (MC3T3-E1) cells by polymerase chain reaction analysis. Runx2 and OPN protein were observed in preosteoblasts, osteoblasts, osteocytes of newly formed bone, blood vessel cells and many fibroblast-like cells of the soft connective tissue. Immunostaining for BSP was more restricted to osteoblasts and osteocytes. Significantly more Runx2- and OPN-expressing cells were seen in the group treated with 300 μg TP508 than in the control group injected with saline or with 30 μg TP508. However, TP508 failed to increase Runx2 mRNA levels significantly in MC3T3-E1 cells after 2–3 days of exposure. Our data suggest that TP508 enhances bone regeneration during DO by increasing the proportion of cells of the osteoblastic lineage. Clinically, TP508 may shorten the healing time during DO; this might be of benefit when bone regeneration is slow.

 in 100% ethanol (5 min). A pre-incubation in hot citrate buffer (0.01 M, pH 6.0, 95°C, 20 min) was performed for antigen retrieval prior to incubation with 30% normal horse serum (30 min). Sections were then incubated overnight with primary monoclonal anti-Runx2 antibody (1:200), anti-BSP antibody (1:400) or anti-OPN antibody (1:600) at 4°C in a humidified chamber. After washes with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), biotinylated horse anti-mouse IgG (ABC-peroxidase Elite kit; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, Calif., USA) was added at a dilution of 1:200 and the sections were incubated at room temperature for a minimum of 60 min. The sections were washed again with PBS, incubated with ABC peroxidase complex for another 60 min followed by a maximum of 20 min in 3,3′ diaminobenzidine substrate solution (Vectastain kit) to visualize the immunoreaction, counterstained with methyl green for 2–3 min, mounted in 50% glycerol and covered with a glass coverslip. As negative controls, sections were incubated with non-immune mouse IgG in place of the primary antibody.

 cells/well) in order to obtain a comparable number of cells at the end of each experiment. After 1 day of culture, the medium was replaced by media containing various concentrations of TP508 (0, 10 or 100 μg/ml). Throughout the experiment, all media were supplemented with 10 nM dexamethasone. Cells were exposed to TP508 for 24, 48 and 72 h, after which times, the cells were collected. The experiment was carried out in quadruplicate and repeated once.

RNA analysis and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction
Total RNA from cultured cells was isolated by using TRIZOL reagent (Gibco) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The RNA content was determined by measuring the absorbance in water at 260 nm by means of an Ultrospec III spectrophotometer (Amersham, Buckinghamshire, England). cDNA synthesis was performed by using 750 ng total RNA in a final reaction volume of 20 μl containing 5 U transcriptor (Roche Applied Science), 5× polymerase chain reaction (PCR) buffer, 4 U random primers (Roche), 20 U protector RNase inhibitor (Roche), 1 mmol each dNTP and 10 μl template. The reverse transcription step was performed on a Gene Amp 9700 Thermocycler (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif., USA) at 55°C for 30 min followed by 85°C for 5 min.

In the group injected with 300 μg TP508, immunostaining for Runx2, OPN and BSP was distributed throughout the regenerating areas. The immunostaining for Runx2, OPN and BSP in the connective tissue in the gap (endosteal area) was relatively high and as intense as in the periosteal callus tissue. In the 30 μg TP508 group and in the control group, staining was less intense in the central gap area than in the periosteal callus area.

In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the increase of bone regeneration by thrombin-related peptide TP508 is associated with an increase in the immunostaining for Runx2, an essential transcription factor of the osteoblastic lineage, and for the bone matrix proteins BSP and OPN. TP508 may thus be a candidate for enhancing bone regeneration when bone regeneration is slow, as occurs in elderly patients.
