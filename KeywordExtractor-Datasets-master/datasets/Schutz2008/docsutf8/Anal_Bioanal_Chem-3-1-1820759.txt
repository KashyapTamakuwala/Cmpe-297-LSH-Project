Overview of analysis for certification





Experimental
Preparation of sediment material
60
Co, 20 kGy). The irradiated powder was re-mixed and homogenized by use of a rocking mixer RM-10S (Aichi Electric, Japan) as a precaution against an inhomogeneous degradation of organotin compounds during sterilization. Finally, the powder was placed in amber glass bottles (15 g each) and stored at −30 °C.

Conversion to dry mass basis
The concentrations of the constituents of this CRM are given on a dry-mass basis. A dry mass correction factor for sample humidity was determined by drying the sample at 110 °C. After 5 h the sediment sample reached constant weight, so it was decided the drying time would be 6 h in this experiment. The dry mass correction factor at the time of certification was 0.959±0.003 (average±standard deviation for ten different bottles).

Extraction procedure
Ultrasonic extraction
The ultrasonic extraction procedure for GC–ICP–MS and GC–MS was as follows. The sediment sample (ca. 0.5 g) was placed in a PFA centrifuge tube and spiked with an appropriate amount of the spikes. Then 2 g NaCl, 12 mL toluene containing 0.1% tropolone, and 10 mL acetic acid–methanol (1:1) were added to the tubes. The resulting mixtures were extracted in an ultrasonic bath for 30 min at 60 °C. After addition of 10 mL water the tubes were again shaken, for good phase separation, and then centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 min. Finally, the upper toluene layer was collected as the extract.
For LC–ICP–MS, the extraction solvent was replaced with 10 mL acetic acid–methanol (1:1) containing 0.1% tropolone, and the same extraction procedure was performed.

Mechanical shaking extraction
−1
 HCl in methanol were added to the tubes, and the resulting mixtures were mechanically shaken for 60 min. After addition of 10 mL water the tubes were again shaken, for good phase separation, and then were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 min. Finally, the upper toluene layer was collected as the extract.

Microwave-assisted extraction
−1
 acetic acid in methanol were added to the vessel. The microwave irradiation program was ramp to 120 °C in 10 min then hold for 10 min. The mixture was transferred to a PFA tube containing 10 mL water and the tube was shaken, for good phase separation, and then centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 min. Finally, the upper toluene layer was collected as the extract.

Pressurized liquid extraction
−1
 acetic acid in methanol containing 0.2% tropolone. The extraction conditions were: oven temp. 110 °C, pressure 10.3 MPa, static time and cycle was 5 min×4 times. The extract obtained was transferred to a PFA tube containing 10 mL water and 12 mL toluene, and the tube was shaken, for good phase separation, and then centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 min. Finally, the upper toluene layer was collected as the extract.

 value (7.1%) was obtained for DPhT, although this value was not very large compared with uncertainties from other sources, for example the uncertainty of analytical results and between-method variance, as is shown later. These results indicate that this material may be considered homogeneous for butyltin and phenyltin analysis.

Stability of organotins in this material

]. In brief, the amounts of organic and inorganic tin species impurities in the organotin chloride reagents were estimated by GC–ICP–MS. The inorganic impurities, except for Sn, were checked by ICP–MS. The non-organotin organic impurities were also checked by GC–FID. The water content of the organotin chloride reagents were evaluated with a Karl–Fisher coulometric titrator (Model CA-05; Mitsubishi, Japan).
The main impurities in the organotin chloride reagents used are water and tin species. Small amounts of inorganic and organotin impurities were observed in both the ethylated MBT and ethylated DBT solutions, and significant amounts of several organotin impurities were observed in the ethylated TBT, ethylated TPhT, and ethylated DPhT solutions. Among the organotin impurities observed in each ethylated organotin solution, inorganic tin, MBT, DBT and tetrabutyltin (TeBT), MPhT, and DPhT were identified from their retention times in GC–ICP–MS measurement and isomers of TBT (iso-TBT) and dioctyldibutyltin (DOcDBT) were identified from the fragment-ion patterns obtained by GC–MS. Two organotin impurities that could not be identified from their retention time were also observed in the ethylated-MBT solution, but the amounts of those were small (<0.03%). The purities of the organotin chloride reagent obtained were 99.4±0.2% for MBT, 99.5±0.2% for DBT, 96.8±0.2% for TBT, 98.6±0.2% for DPhT, and 98.8±0.2% for TPhT.

] (2–3% in both extractions under their optimized conditions). These differences could be because of different extraction conditions. The sample size used in our experiments was two to four times that used by Encinar, and the concentrations of acetic acid we used were lower. In addition, tropolone was used as a chelating reagent in all the four extraction methods. Formation of the tropolone-chelating complex might prevent degradation. The slight degradation of DBT observed would not significantly affect the analytical results obtained by use of MAE and PLE because the typical uncertainty of isotope-ratio measurement by GC–ICP–MS in this study was in the range 0.5 to 1%, and the relative standard deviations of the analytical results for DBT obtained by use of MAE and PLE were approximately 3%. As is shown later, the analytical results obtained by use of the four different extraction methods were in good agreement within the range of uncertainties. These results indicate that analytical biases caused by degradation or inter-conversion of analytes in the extraction would be negligible in this certification.

The analytical results obtained by use of the six methods were in good agreement within the range of their uncertainties; this agreement may indicate there were no significant analytical biases between measurement and extraction techniques for all the analytes. Therefore, all the analytical results obtained were treated equally for calculation and evaluation of the certified values and their uncertainties.
