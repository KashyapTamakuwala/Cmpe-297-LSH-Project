 trees. Grasses growing under trees had a much higher forage quality than grasses from the open field indicated by a more favourable leaf/stem ratio and higher protein and lower fibre concentrations. Analysing the grass leaf data with a linear programming model indicated that large savanna trees could be essential for the survival of wildebeest, the dominant herbivore in Tarangire. Due to the high fibre content and low nutrient and protein concentrations of grasses from the open field, maximum fibre intake is reached before nutrient requirements are satisfied. All requirements can only be satisfied by combining forage from open grassland with either forage from under or around tree canopies. Forage quality was also higher around dead trees than in the open field. So forage quality does not reduce immediately after trees die which explains why negative effects of reduced tree numbers probably go initially unnoticed. In conclusion our results suggest that continued destruction of large trees could affect future numbers of large herbivores in African savannas and better protection of large trees is probably necessary to sustain high animal densities in these ecosystems.

, on nutrient concentrations, protein content and digestibility of grasses. We included small, large and dead trees in our study to be able to determine how large tree destruction affects forage quality through time. A linear programming model was used to test the hypothesis that forage growing under trees is necessary for the long-term survival of wildebeest, the dominant large herbivore in East African savannas.

). Under tree canopies, plots were located in between the tree stem and canopy edge. Plots around tree canopies were selected at twice the distance from the stem, as the edge of the tree crown. For example, if the canopy edge was at 10 m from the trunk the centre of the plot under the canopy was located at 5 m from the trunk and the plot “around canopies” at 20 m from the trunk. Open grassland plots were at least 50 m from any tree.

). The different constraints were used to calculate whether wildebeest can meet all nutritional and energy requirements for maintenance (to maintain a stable body weight) by selecting forage from different foraging zones. As an input value for each of the three zones a weighted average, depending on plant cover, of the dominant grass species was used. Plant cover instead of biomass was used because only plant cover data were available.

Statistical analysis
Percentages of dead and live leaves and stems, nutrient concentrations, NDF and DOM of grass samples were analysed with a general linear model (GLM) with vegetation zone (under and around tree canopies, and open grassland) as fixed factors and trees as a random factor. Differences in NDF, DOM and protein concentrations of grasses from different tree stages (open grassland, bushes and small, large and dead trees) were analysed with a GLM with tree stage as a fixed factor. All data were statistically analysed with SPSS 11.0.

) and have a smaller positive effect on forage quality than large trees. Grass forage quality under the small trees was also still significantly lower than under large trees. The small trees we used for our study were about 20 years old so it will take more than two decades before forage quality will be as good as before clearing. Another problem is that the contradictory effects of different sized trees on grass quality and production can encourage bush-clearing. Increased grass production after large tree removal suggests that trees negatively affect grass production. After clearing the large trees, regenerating bushes start to repress grass production which again encourages removal of all woody species. Bush-clearing is, however, ultimately counterproductive because it will result in savannas with few or no large trees and thus a much lower forage quality.

These negative effects of tree removal are probably usually not recognised because forage quality only slowly reduces after trees die. However, better protection of large trees in savanna ecosystems could be necessary to sustain current numbers of large herbivores.
