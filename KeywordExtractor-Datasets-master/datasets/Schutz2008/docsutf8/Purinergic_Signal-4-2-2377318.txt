This medium was supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and contained (per 1,000 ml) dexamethasone (100 μl/l of 2 mg/ml stock), interferon-γ (25 μl of 800 U/μl stock), T3 (10 μl/l of 13 mg/ml stock), G418 (500 μl of 400 μg/ul stock), penicillin-streptomycin (10 ml of 100X stock), and ITS (10 ml of 0.5 mg/ml insulin transferrin selenium concentrated stocks). The cells continued to be bathed on both sides of the filter until a monolayer tight to fluid formed. Measurement of the resistance of the filters was used as an indicator of the formation of a mature monolayer. Once the monolayers were formed for at least 12 h, the cells were then acceptable for the experimental assay.

]. In different orders of addition, we used the following stimuli: (1) ionomycin (2 μM) (to increase the intracellular calcium concentration), (2) distilled water with 1 mg/ml luciferase-luciferin (to dilute the osmotic strength of the Opti-MEM I medium), and (3) intentionally harsh pipetting in the center of the apical surface of the cell monolayer (to induce a mechanical stimulus on the apical membrane). Normally, addition of drug or distilled water (or the same volume of medium as a volume addition control) is performed or dispensed very slowly along the wall of the plastic support that holds the permeable filter so as not to disrupt the tight, confluent monolayer. Therefore, by quickly pipetting the medium up and down onto the monolayers, a mechanical stimulation is induced. Luminescence was measured for 6 min after each stimulus. All experiments ended with the addition of hexokinase to eliminate any ATP left in the medium. All assays were performed at room temperature.

Fig. 7
Typical real-time course of hypotonic challenge-induced ATP release across the apical cell surface in mutant versus rescued cell monolayers. Hypotonicity induced a marked increase in ATP release that was fivefold more robust in rescued cell monolayers versus mutant cell monolayers. Of interest, however, mechanical stimulation via repeated pipetting near the center of the cell monolayers had no effect on ATP release after hypotonic cell swelling. These data suggest that both stimuli are indeed mechanical in nature and that the same pool of “releasable” ATP is being affected by each stimulus. The slight drop in signal with the pipetting stimulus is the addition of 50 μl of isotonic medium to the 400 μl of 50% diluted medium and the resultant change in osmotic strength at the apical cell surface. The hypotonicity-induced signal observed from mutant cell monolayers is again greatly attenuated



Fig. 8
Typical real-time course of all three stimuli given in an order where each stimulation can be observed in mutant versus rescued cell monolayers. Although the large scale diminished the mechanically induced signal and data, an ATP release transient is observed in rescued cell monolayers and not in mutant cell monolayers. The monophasic ionomycin response is then observed, again more robust in rescued cell monolayers. Then, hypotonic challenge is performed in the presence of ionomycin. Here, the largest values of secreted ATP are observed that approach ∼15–20 μM in the apical medium bathing cilium-competent cell monolayers. In these plots, the effects of the broad specificity anion transport inhibitor, DIDS, are shown. DIDS diminishes ATP release in both types of monolayers and in other epithelial cell monolayer preparations to different degrees. The inhibition is partial and DIDS does not affect the detection reagent. Hexokinase is added at the end of each experiment to eliminate secreted ATP and to diminish the luminescence signal to low levels

 shows the relative effects of the three stimuli used in this study on rescued cilium-competent cell monolayers and on mutant cilium-deficient cell monolayers. Although greatly diminished because of the Y-axis scale, the mechanical stimulus triggered a fourfold greater ATP secretion transient in the rescued cell monolayers versus the mutant cell monolayers. Ionomycin also produced a fourfold greater sustained ATP release in rescued versus mutant monolayers. Hypotonic challenge also triggered a more robust response in the mutant cell monolayers. A large degree of the stimulated ATP release was inhibited by the broad specificity anion transport inhibitor, DIDS, suggesting that an ATP transport process may be mediating the release of ATP from intracellular pools. In the presence of DIDS inhibition, release is inhibited while degradation of released ATP proceeds unabated, leading to a sharp decline in the signal. In contrast, ionomycin-stimulated ATP release is attenuated by performing the luminescence experiment at 4°C (data not shown), suggesting a vesicular mechanism of release. Hexokinase is added at the end of every protocol to scavenge the ATP and abolish the luminescence signal.

 is critically important for priming the ATP release machinery. These data also suggest that the “releasable” pools of ATP are present in cilium-competent cell monolayers beneath the apical cell surface, while they may be impaired or missing in cilium-deficient cell monolayers. These ideas will be revisited and discussed below.

], we devised a flow chamber where the apical versus basolateral sides of the monolayer could be perfused independently and at different flow rates. The 12-mm diameter Snapwell transwell filter can then be inserted into this chamber for selective perfusion and fluorescence imaging. With a constant low rate of perfusion of the basolateral surface of the monolayers, low versus high rates of perfusion were performed on the apical surface in rescued versus mutant monolayers.

 primes the “releasable” pools of ATP that are mobilized by hypotonic cell swelling and other mechanical stimuli. However, one can still observe both pipetting- and hypotonicity-induced ATP release without ionomycin pretreatment that is more robust in cilium-competent versus cilium-deficient cell monolayers. Moreover, we also found that we could not observe a mechanically induced ATP release signal after hypotonic cell swelling. This finding suggests that these two “mechanical” stimuli (albeit different) affect the same pool of releasable ATP. Unfortunately, we still need better tools to define each ATP release mechanism and pool. However, our work with low temperature inhibition of vesicle traffic and inhibition of anion transport properties with the broad specificity inhibitor, DIDS, suggests that both ATP transport mechanisms and exocytosis of ATP-filled vesicles contribute to secreted ATP phenotypes (EM Schwiebert et al., unpublished observations).

 transient, induced by flow in our study or by other modes in other studies, requires an underlying autocrine ATP signal that is likely transduced by P2X and P2Y ATP receptors on or near the monocilium. Without a well-formed cilium at the apical surface, autocrine purinergic signaling, cilium-derived signaling, and modulation of downstream effectors become disrupted.
