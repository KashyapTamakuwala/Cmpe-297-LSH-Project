), mean heart rate during CT was 70.3±14.2 bpm (range 47–102 bpm), and mean Agatston score was 821±904 (range 0–3,110). Image quality was diagnostic (scores 1–3) in 98.6% (414/420) of segments (mean image quality score 1.68±0.75); six segments in three patients were considered not assessable (1.4%). DSCT correctly identified 54 of 56 significant coronary stenoses. Severe calcifications accounted for false ratings in nine segments (eight FP/one FN) and motion artifacts in two segments (one FP/one FN). Overall sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value for evaluating CAD were 96.4, 97.5, 85.7, and 99.4%, respectively. First experience indicates that DSCT coronary angiography provides high diagnostic accuracy for assessment of CAD in a high pre-test probability population with extensive coronary calcifications and without heart rate control.

The purpose of our study was to determine the performance of DSCT coronary angiography in diagnosing significant stenoses in comparison to invasive coronary angiography (ICA) in a high pre-test probability patient population without heart rate control.

Dual-source CT scan protocol
All CT examinations were performed on a DSCT scanner (Somatom Definition, Siemens Medical Solutions, Forchheim, Germany). The patients were centrally placed in the scanner to ensure that the entire heart was covered with the smaller field-of-view of the second tube detector array. Irrespective of the individual heart rate and the heart rate variability, no beta-blockers were given prior to the scan. Three patients took oral beta-blockers as part of their baseline medication.
Nonenhanced DSCT for calcium scoring was performed from 1 cm below the level of the tracheal bifurcation to the diaphragm in a cranio-caudal direction using the following scanning parameters: detector collimation 32×0.6 mm, slice acquisition 64×0.6 mm by means of a z-flying focal spot, gantry rotation time 330 ms, pitch of 0.2–0.39 adapted to the heart rate, tube current 80 mAs per rotation, and tube potential 120 kV.
22
]. After 2 min, the coronary angiography scan was started by continuously injecting a bolus of 80 ml of iodixanol (Visipaque 320, 320 mg/mL, GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK) followed by 30 ml saline solution into an antecubital vein via an 18-gauge catheter (injection rate 5 mL/s). Contrast agent application was controlled by bolus tracking. A region of interest (ROI; mean diameter 10.1±5.6 mm, range 7.5–17.0 mm) was placed into the aortic root, and image acquisition started 5 s after the signal attenuation reached the predefined threshold of 100 Hounsfield units (HU). Data acquisition was performed from 1 cm below the level of the tracheal bifurcation to the diaphragm in a cranio-caudal direction with a detector collimation of 32×0.6 mm, slice acquisition 64×0.6 mm by means of a z-flying focal spot, gantry rotation time 330 ms, pitch of 0.2–0.43 adapted to the heart rate, tube current 400 mAs per rotation, and tube potential 120 kV. ECG-pulsing for radiation dose reduction was applied in all patients. At mean heart rates below 60 bpm, full tube current was applied from 60 to 70%, at 61–70 bpm from 50 to 80%, and at heart rates above 70 from 30 to 80% of the RR-interval. The electrocardiogram (ECG) was digitally recorded during data acquisition and was stored with the unprocessed CT dataset.

Dual-source CT image reconstruction
18
]. In each patient, images were first reconstructed at 60 and 70% of the RR-interval. If considered necessary, additional images were reconstructed in 5% steps of the RR interval within the full tube current window. In case of irregular heart rates, the temporal variability in the reconstruction phase was compensated by manual ECG editing. In case of premature heart beats, the temporal window past the premature heart beat was deleted, and the next diastolic window was filled with one to three temporal windows to avoid data gaps. All ECG editing was performed by one experienced cardiovascular radiologist not involved in data read-out. For calcium scoring, non-overlapping images with a slice width of 3 mm were reconstructed using a medium-sharp convolution kernel (B35f). For DSCT coronary angiography, images were reconstructed from the contrast-enhanced DSCT scan with a slice thickness of 0.75 mm, a reconstruction increment of 0.5 mm, and using a medium soft-tissue convolution kernel (B26f). Depending on the individual anatomy, the reconstructed field-of-view (FoV) was adjusted to encompass the heart exactly (mean FoV 167±19 mm; range 131–187 mm; image matrix 512×512 pixels). After removing patient and ECG information, all reconstructed images were transferred to a dedicated workstation (Wizard, Siemens Medical Solutions) equipped with dedicated cardiac post-processing software (Syngo Circulation, Siemens Medical Solutions).

Dual-source CT data analysis
The mean Agatston score was calculated for each patient from the non-enhanced DSCT data with a detection threshold of 130 HU by using semi-automated software (Syngo Calcium Scoring, Siemens Medical Solutions).
23
]. The right coronary artery (RCA) was defined to include segments 1–4, the left main and left anterior descending artery (LM-LAD) to include segments 5–10, and the left circumflex artery (LCX) to include segments 11–15. The intermedial artery was designated as segment 16, if present. All segments with a diameter of at least 1.5 mm at their origin were included. Diameter measurements were performed with an electronic caliper tool. Segments distal to an occluded vessel were excluded from analysis.

]: 1, excellent (no artifacts, unrestricted evaluation); 2, good (minor artifacts, good diagnostic quality); 3, adequate (moderate artifacts, still acceptable and diagnostic), and 4, not assessable (severe artifacts impairing accurate evaluation). Causes of image degradation were noted by both observers as arterial wall calcifications, motion artifacts, or others. Motion artifacts were defined as any impairment of image quality caused by vessel movement resulting in blurred or doubled vessel contours. Other reasons included low vessel opacification, low signal-to-noise ratio, and disturbing adjacent structures such as contrast-enhanced cardiac veins.
In addition, both readers assessed all coronary artery segments for the presence of hemodynamically significant stenoses. Significant stenosis was defined as narrowing of the coronary luminal diameter exceeding 50%. The vessel diameters were measured on reconstructions perpendicularly oriented to the vessel course.
For any disagreement in data analysis, consensus agreement was achieved.

Invasive coronary angiography
23
]. Each vessel segment was scored as being significantly stenosed, defined as a diameter reduction of >50% or not. Coronary artery analysis was performed in all vessels with a luminal diameter of at least 1.5 mm, excluding those vessels distal to complete occlusions.

Statistical analysis
24
] using the clustered data. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were calculated from chi-squared tests of contingency, and the 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated from binomial expression on a per-segment basis. Because of the interdependencies between different segments, the statistics were also calculated on a per-patient basis (presence of at least one significant coronary artery stenosis or absence of any significant stenosis in each patient). ICA was considered the standard of reference.


Results
DSCT and ICA were successfully performed in all patients without complications. The DSCT protocol was well tolerated by all patients, and all were able to hold their breath during data acquisition. The average HR during scanning was 70.3±14.2 bpm (range 47–102 bpm). Seventeen patients (56.7%) had a heart rate below 70 bpm (mean 59.7±5.9 bpm, range 47–66 bpm), while 13 patients (43.3%) had a heart rate of ≥70 bpm (mean 84.2±8.4 bpm, range 72–102 bpm).
Prevalance of coronary artery stenosis and calcium score
A total of 56 coronary artery stenoses with a luminal narrowing of more than 50% in diameter were identified in 15 patients (50.0%) using ICA. Single-vessel disease was present in 13.3% (4/30), two-vessel disease in 10.0% (3/30), and three-vessel disease in 26.7% (8/30). Significant coronary artery stenoses could be excluded in 15 patients (50.0%).
Calcified vessel wall deposits were present in 24 patients (80%). Fourteen of these patients (58.3%) had significant coronary artery stenoses, while 10 patients (41.7%) had calcifications without significant stenoses. The mean Agatston score was 821±904 (range 0–3,110). Agatston score was <400 in 15 patients (50%, mean score 85±118) and ≥400 in the other 15 patients (50%, mean score 1,483±893).

Image quality and image reconstruction intervals with DSCT
A total of 420 coronary artery segments with a diameter ≥1.5 mm were evaluated (11 segments were missing because of anatomical variants, 26 segments had a diameter less than 1.5 mm at their origin, and 9 segments were distal to an occluding stenosis). An intermedial artery was present in 16 patients (53.3%). Inter-observer agreement for image quality rating using clustered data was moderate (kappa=0.68). The initially used reconstruction time-points of 60 and 70% provided excellent image quality (score 1) in 21.9% (92/420) and 60.2% (253/420), respectively, while additional reconstructions were necessary in 17.9% (75/420) to improve image quality. Whereas in the subgroup of patients with heart rates ≥70 bpm additional reconstructions at 30 to 50% were considered necessary in 27.4% (48/175), in patients with heart rates <70 bpm, the 60 and 70% interval provided excellent image quality (score 1) in 90.2% of the segments [30.2% (74/245) and 60.0% (147/245), respectively].

Discussion
Four main conclusions can be drawn from this study. First, DSCT coronary angiography provides a high diagnostic accuracy for the evaluation of CAD. Second, this high diagnostic performance of DSCT could be achieved in a patient population with extensive calcifications and in whom no heart rate control using beta blocker medication prior to CT was performed. Third, taking into account these circumstances, only six (1.4%) segments had to be excluded from data analysis, all in the distal part of the coronary artery tree with small vessel diameters. Fourth, false ratings were primarily due to severe vessel wall calcifications rather than motion artifacts.
18
]. DSCT scanners with 0.33-s gantry rotation time and 32×0.6 mm collimation in combination with double z-sampling (i.e., simultaneous acquisition of 64 overlapping 0.6-mm slices) fulfill these requirements. 
19
20
]. This study is, to the best of our knowledge, the first to demonstrate a high diagnostic accuracy of DSCT coronary angiography for the diagnosis of CAD in comparison to ICA. By including a patient population with a high prevalence of coronary calcification and without heart rate control during scanning, we found an overall sensitivity of 96.4% and specificity of 97.5% for the detection of significant coronary stenoses. These results are comparable to those previously reported with 64-slice CT; however, beta-blocker administration for strict heart rate control was needed in those studies to compensate for motion artifacts. By including patients with heart rates up to 102 bpm, we found minor to moderate vessel wall blurring due to motion artifacts to be present at high heart rates; however, only 1.4% of all segments had to be excluded from analysis because they were non-diagnostic.

] reported a considerable decline in diagnostic accuracy in patients with Agatston scores >400 with a sensitivity of 93%, a specificity of 67%, and positive and negative predictive values of 93 and 67%, respectively. Using the same cut-off Agatston score, we found a sensitivity of 96%, a specificity of 95%, and positive and negative predictive values of 86 and 99%, respectively. Considering that the spatial resolution of DSCT is the same as that of the single-source 64-slice CT scanner, this apparent difference in calcification-dependency could indicate that the blooming artifact of severely calcified vessel walls may be sometimes superimposed by additional motion artifacts.

Conclusion
First experience indicates that DSCT coronary angiography provides high diagnostic accuracy for assessment of CAD in a high pre-test probability population with extensive coronary calcifications and without heart rate control. Further studies are needed to confirm our results in appropriate clinical settings with larger patient populations.
