Objective
We previously demonstrated that upregulation of renal inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) is associated with proximal tubule injury during systemic inflammation in humans. In this study we investigated the short-term effect of methylene blue (MB), an inhibitor of the NO pathway, on kidney damage and function in septic shock patients.

Design and setting
A prospective clinical study conducted in an intensive care unit.

Patients
Nine patients (four men, five women, mean age 71 ± 3 years) with confirmed or suspected bacterial infection and with refractory septic shock defined as a mean arterial pressure ≤ 70 mmHg despite norepinephrine infusion ≥ 0.2 μg/kg per minute.

Interventions
A 4 h continuous intravenous infusion of 1 mg/kg MB per hour.

Measurements and results
S
-transferase A1-1 and P1-1, markers for proximal and distal tubule damage, respectively, decreased by 45% (10–70%) and 70% (40–85) vs. baseline. After termination of the MB infusion the NO metabolites and markers of tubular injury returned to pretreatment levels.

Conclusions
In septic patients with refractory shock short-term infusion of MB is associated with a decrease in NO production and an attenuation of the urinary excretion of renal tubular injury markers.

Material and methods
Patients
Nine patients received a 4 h continuous infusion of 1 mg/kg per hour MB (1% w/v) provided by the VieCuri Medical Center pharmacy (for inclusion criteria see Electronic Supplementary Material, ESM). Arterial blood and catheterized urine were collected at several time points during the first 24 h. Clinical parameters, the severity of illness using Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II), and Sepsis-Related Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) were recorded.

In conclusion, short-term infusion of MB in septic patients with refractory shock, is associated with a decrease in NO production and an attenuation of the urinary excretion of renal tubular injury markers.
