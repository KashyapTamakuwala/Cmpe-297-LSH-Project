Quantifying tooth wear in general and erosion in particular mostly is made by distinguishing between lesions restricted to enamel and lesions reaching the underlying dentine. Various scores for grading have been used, but in all systems, higher scores are given in cases of exposed dentine, thus, indicating a more severe stage of the condition. Clinical diagnosis of exposed dentine is made by assessing changes in colour or optical properties of the hard tissues. This paper aims to review the literature and discuss critically problems arising form this approach. It appears that classifying the severity of erosion by the area or depth of exposed dentine is difficult and poorly reproducible, and taking into account the variation of enamel thickness, the amount of tissue lost often is not related simply to the area of exposed dentine. There has still been very little longitudinal investigation of the significance of exposed dentine as a prognostic indicator. Further work and discussion is needed to reevaluate the explanative power of current grading procedures.

Does dentine exposure correlate with the severity of erosion?
For grading, the overwhelming majority of tooth wear and erosion indices use the differentiation between lesions restricted to enamel and lesions reaching the underlying dentine. The rationale for linking severity of erosion to extension into dentine probably stems from experience with dental caries and restorative procedures, but has not yet been critically discussed. It is an interesting question whether the progression of erosion from enamel into dentine has any significance in terms of disease, although it may well have a bearing in terms of treatment and, sometimes, the presence of symptoms of hypersensitivity felt by the patient.

]. This would explain the finding that lower first molars, particularly the mesio-buccal cusp tip, is the region where exposed dentine occurs most often. Taking into account the gross variation in enamel thickness, it is not surprising that the correlation between exposed dentine and the severity of wear is weak.

]. This showed that in 31 teeth with visually diagnosed wear, only three had enamel present histologically, and even in one of ten teeth in which no wear was diagnosed visually, the histological examination revealed exposed dentine.

]. When the severity of lesions is defined by the degree of exposure of dentine, the severity score could assume that tooth wear will progress more rapidly in the future. However, this has not been proven in incidence studies. The predictive value of a diagnosis of exposed dentine to future dental erosion or other forms of tooth wear is far from clear, and longitudinal studies are urgently needed to determine the progression, particularly of erosion, at different sites in the dentition.

Can dentine exposure be reliably and reproducibly diagnosed?

Fig. 1
Cupping of the cusp tips on the molar teeth is an early sign of erosion where extension of erosion into dentine is difficult to determine




One major problem in assessing the degree of erosion in cupping is whether or not the dentine has been exposed at the base of the lesion. Because labial and palatal enamel surfaces have a greater surface area, the observer better appreciates their surface anatomy than with a narrow cup-like lesion formed into a tooth cusp tip. Thus, grading the severity of cuppings is more difficult than perhaps it is for labial and palatal surfaces.
17
] demonstrated that when compared with histological examination, only 65% of areas with exposed dentine, 88% of areas with enamel present and 67% of all areas examined had been diagnosed correctly. Clinicians demonstrated relatively poor reliability and reproducibility in their diagnosis of dentine exposure regardless of their professional experience.

] appeared to offer the possibility of differentiating accurately between erosion into enamel and into dentine. This method may, according to the authors, even be applicable in vivo, although the reported studies were in vitro.

What is the interplay of factors causing tooth wear and how can other forms of tooth wear be distinguished from erosion when the wear has reached dentine?
24
], but the interplay of factors is often complex. Although the net outcome of erosive and reparative factors does not necessarily have to be tooth wear, it appears that once tooth wear has started, the interaction of these factors becomes ever more complex, not least by the time tooth wear has reached the dentine. Thus, the interplay of physical and chemical factors and the relevance of this to dentine wear will be considered together.
Relevant physical forces are attrition and abrasion either from mastication or from oral hygiene procedures. Frequent exposure to dietary or gastric acid will lead to a softening of the dental hard tissues, making it easier for forces of attrition and abrasion to contribute significantly to the overall wear on the teeth. Whilst the effects of acids on enamel are relatively simple, leading to the dissolution of mineral and surface softening, the results on dentine are more complex. Chronic exposure to acids not only leads to an increasing loss of mineral but also to a progressive exposure of the organic dentine matrix, the effects of which, however, are not well known.

]. This can take place when an abrasive diet is consumed or in cases of acid-weakened dental tissues where a less abrasive bolus could also have similar effects. Clinically, the shape of occlusal lesions can be remarkably similar, making the diagnosis of the predominant aetiological factor difficult to determine.

In conclusion, distinctions are commonly made between erosion into enamel and erosion into dentine. Methods of scoring are derived from parameters associated more with dental caries and restorative procedures for that disease rather than specifically for tooth wear. The interplay of tooth wear factors is complex and requires further research. Classifying the severity of erosion by the area or depth of exposed dentine is difficult and poorly reproducible and, particularly with respect to the variation of enamel thickness, the amount of tissue lost often is not related to dentine exposure. There has still been very little longitudinal investigation of the significance of exposed dentine as a prognostic indicator. Further work is needed to reevaluate the explanative power of current grading procedures.
