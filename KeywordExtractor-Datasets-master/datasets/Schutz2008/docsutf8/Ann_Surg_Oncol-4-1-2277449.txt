Background
Isolated hepatic perfusion with high-dose chemotherapy is a treatment option for patients with irresectable metastases confined to the liver. Prolonged local control and impact on survival have been claimed. Major drawbacks are magnitude and costs of the procedure. We developed an isolated hypoxic hepatic perfusion (IHHP) with retrograde outflow without the need for a heart-lung machine.

Patients and Methods
Twenty-four consecutive patients with irresectable metastases of various origins were treated. IHHP inflow was via the hepatic artery, outflow via the portal vein with occlusion of the retrohepatic caval vein. Radiolabeled albumine was used for leakage monitoring. Melphalan was used at 1–2 mg/kg. A 25-minute perfusion period was followed by a complete washout. Local and systemic melphalan concentrations were determined.

Results
Compared with oxygenated classical IHP, the IHPP procedure reduced operation time from >8 h to 4 hours, blood loss from >4000 to 900 cc and saved material and personnel costs. Leakage was 0% with negligible systemic toxicity and 0% perioperative mortality. Tumor response: complete response (CR) in 4%, partial response (PR) in 58%, and stable disease (SD) in 13%. Median time to progression was 9 months (2–24 months); pharmacokinetics demonstrated intrahepatic melphalan concentrations more than 9 fold higher than postperfusion systemic concentrations.

Conclusions
IHPP is a relatively simple procedure with reduced costs, reduced blood loss, no mortality, limited toxicity, and response rates comparable to classic IHP. The median duration of 9 months of tumor control should be improved. Hereto, vasoactive drugs, will be explored in further studies.

 A major drawback of the technique was 38% systemic leakage rate. On the basis of these results, we modified the technique by applying an “open” surgical procedure; balloon catheters are replaced by clamps and all tributaries to the vena cava such as the adrenal, lumbar, and diaphragmatic veins are dissected and ligated. Here we present the results of the first 24 patients with irresectable liver metastases who underwent an IHHP with melphalan. The major difference between this new technique and the classic IHP is that there is no veno-veno bypass and heart-lung machine involved and the drainage of the liver is retrograde through the portal vein.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Selection Criteria
17
 In all patients a radical resection of the primary tumor was performed prior to entering the study protocol except for one patient with hepatic metastasis of unknown primary. The liver metastases were considered irresectable, on the basis of multiple lesions in multiple segments of the liver and/or location near vascular structures. Tumor involvement had to be less than 50% of the total liver volume to prevent massive necrosis in case of a response. Absence of extra hepatic tumor growth was evaluated by computed tomography (CT) scan of thorax and abdomen. All patients had a Karnofsky performance score of at least 90, liver enzymes (ALAT, ASAT and AF) not higher than five times the normal values, and bilirubin not higher than two times the normal values. Exclusion criteria included: age younger than 18 or older than 70, portal hypertension, significant central nervous system disease, significant cardiovascular, pulmonary or renal disease, uncontrolled infections, presence of organ grafts, and chemotherapy or radiation therapy within 4 weeks prior to the IHHP. Routinely, an angiography was performed to exclude aberrant hepatic arteries or to visualize other anatomic anomalies. The study protocol was approved by the Medical Ethical Committee of the Erasmus University Medical Centre, and written informed consent was obtained from all patients.

Perfusion Circuit
Perfusion sets (PfM, GmbH, Cologne, Germany) consisted of a tubing set with a volume of 220 mL, containing a bubble trap. All IHHPs were performed with inflow via the hepatic artery and outflow via portal vein. In the perfusion circuit, flow was maintained by a roller pump and pressure was measured via a sideline.

Drugs
A dosage of 1 mg/kg melphalan (L-Pam, Alkeran, Wellcome Ltd. London, UK) was used in 20 of the 24 patients and infused through a sideline into the perfusion circuit. Two times 1.5 mg/kg melphalan and two times 2.0 mg/kg was used. In the first eight patients, a bolus infusion was used. In the last 16 patients, a 10-minute pump infusion was used. The total perfusion (10-minute infusion included) with melphalan was conducted for 20 to 30 minutes.

Surgical Procedure of the Retrograde Flow IHHP

FIG. 1.
The retrograde perfusion setup.




The perfusate was circulated by a constant flow. Stable perfusion was monitored by pressure measurement and the perfusate level in the bubble trap. Hereafter, melphalan was infused into the circuit and the perfusion was conducted for 20 to 30 minutes. Thereafter, a washout procedure was performed by 1 L of Haemaccel collecting the venous effluent. Total liver ischemia time never exceeded 60 minutes.
The isolation was terminated by relief of the clamps on the caval vein followed by the relief of the aortic clamp, controlling systemic blood pressure. The catheter in the hepatic artery could be removed and the gastroduodenal artery could be ligated followed by decanulation and closing the venotomy of the portal vein. In case of an aberrant left hepatic artery, this artery was ligated after removal of the catheter.

Operation Characteristics
.
 Perioperative mortality (<90 days) was 0%. Median hospital stay was 9 days (5–29 days).

Leakage Control
All IHHPs were leakage free during the perfusion except in one patient, where 2% systemic leakage was measured. When this perfusion was finished, it appeared that in this patient there was an insufficient clamping of the suprahepatic caval vein. After washout of the isolated circuit with Haemaccell, a median of 7% (4–10%) leakage into the systemic circuit was demonstrated by continued monitoring until the end of the operation.

)
Hepatic toxicity consisted mainly of a transient rise of liver enzymes during the first week after IHHP. WHO grade I occurred in 92% of the patients (22 of 24) and WHO grade II in 8% of the patients (2 of 24). Three patients experienced bile duct necrosis (discussed in detail in the section “Complications”). No other hepatic toxicities occurred (no coagulopathy was observed). Systemic toxicity was mainly leucopenia, WHO grade I–III in 25% (6 of 24), and severe grade IV leucopenia in one patient (4%) after perfusion. Two of these patients received G-CSF (Neupogen, Amgen B.V., Breda, The Netherlands). One patient received prophylactic G-CSF. Eighteen patients (71%) did not develop leucopenia. No renal (except for one patient grade 1) or gastrointestinal toxicity was observed.

DISCUSSION
Isolated liver perfusions are only performed by a few centers worldwide, demonstrating promising antitumor effects; however, the technique is a major, complex, expensive, and time-consuming operation. In the present study we describe an alternative technique using a retrograde hepatic flow in an isolated hypoxic hepatic perfusion (IHHP) system. The technique was performed in 24 patients and demonstrated to be safe, with minimal morbidity and no morbidity. Overall response rate was 62% with no progression in 75%, and median time to progression of disease was 9 months.

 = 124). Classical IHP uses a venovenous bypass and a heart-lung machine, which is a time-consuming procedure necessitating a specialized perfusion team. In the present study a modification was developed, allowing a safe perfusion in a shorter operation time (median duration, 4 hour), with less blood loss (median, 900 cc), reducing morbidity and without mortality, without the need of a heart-lung machine or venovenous bypass.

 The study also demonstrated that tumor response was not affected by melphalan peak concentration, but by the total dose of melphalan. Therefore, to prevent high peak concentrations keeping the same concentration of melphalan, bolus infusions were replaced by a 10-minute pump infusion. This resulted in the absence of bile duct necrosis in the last 16 perfused patients.
The maximum period of 60-minute hypoxia did not seem to result in extrahepatic and/or systemic toxicity. Moreover, clamping of the aorta just underneath the diaphragm for a maximum of 60 minutes did not lead to renal and/or gastrointestinal morbidity.

 This may explain our remarkably low hepatic toxicity in the present series using retrograde outflow in a clinical setting.

 At this time, IHHP should be reserved for those patients who are progressive on standard chemotherapy protocols. When responses in future trials are improved, this technique might be optional for patients who prefer a single procedure, which could potentially lead to similar results as multiple courses of systemic or intra-arterial chemotherapy. Leaving behind at the end of the IHHP a port-a-cath system for subsequent HAI in case of (re)progression should also be considered as a strategy to further improve prolonged locoregional tumor control.

 = 4), IHP seems to be an effective treatment. All four patients died because of progressive tumor growth and consequent liver failure after 6, 9, 15, and 20 months. Therefore, especially in this group of patients, local tumor control is likely to result in a survival benefit.

CONCLUSIONS
Isolated hypoxic hepatic perfusion with retrograde outflow via portal vein is a promising technique that is a relatively simple procedure with reduced blood loss, no mortality, very limited toxicity, and response rates comparable to classic, extensive IHP. The operation time is reduced to 4 hours, without the need of a heart-lung machine and perfusionists, which reduces the costs.
