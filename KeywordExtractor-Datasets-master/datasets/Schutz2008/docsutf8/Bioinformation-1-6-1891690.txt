Features of DoD2006
Newly appended databases in DoD2006 are distinguished from the existing ones with a ‘+’ sign and inaccessible ones are recognized by a ‘*’ sign before the name. All databases in each category are given alphabetically. The appended databases 
			are colored blue and the remaining in green color. Those who wish to have their database to be listed can contact the authors.
DoD2006 provides an excellent and essential resource for molecular and computational biologists. Research through computational tools and software using databases has been recognized as a front-line research coupled with experimental design. Our 
database suits to deliver the wide biological content through the cross-database interface. Updates to DoD shall be made on yearly basis.
