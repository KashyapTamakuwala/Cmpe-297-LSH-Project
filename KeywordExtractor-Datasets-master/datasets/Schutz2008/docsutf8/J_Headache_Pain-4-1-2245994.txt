Primary headaches such as migraine are among the most prevalent neurological disorders, affecting up to one-fifth of the adult population. The scientific work in the last decade has unraveled much of the pathophysiological background of migraine, which is now considered to be a neurovascular disorder. It has been discovered that the trigemino-cerebrovascular system plays a key role in migraine headache pathophysiology by releasing the potent vasodilator calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). This neuropeptide is released in parallel with the pain and its concentration correlates well with the intensity of the headache. The development of drugs of the triptan class has provided relief for the acute attacks but at the cost of, mainly cardiovascular, side effects. Thus, the intention to improve treatment led to the development of small CGRP receptor antagonists such as olcegepant (BIBN4096BS) and MK-0974 that alleviate the acute migraine attack without acute side events. The purpose of this review is to give a short overview of the pathological background of migraine headache and to illustrate the mechanisms behind the actions of triptans and the promising CGRP receptor blockers.

However, small contractions may anyhow have proportionally greater impact in diseased artery with luminal narrowing. Triptans are hence contra-indicated in patients with known cardiovascular disease.

Concerning tolerability and safety, MK-0974 was generally well-tolerated. The reported side effects were mainly nausea, dizziness and somnolence, but the incidence of adverse experiences seemed to be comparable to the placebo group. In addition, there was no increase in adverse events with increasing dose.

]. In addition, they show a prolonged effect of action compared to the triptans. That may suggest not only less rebound headache but perhaps also a prophylactic possibility. Furthermore, only minor adverse effects were reported and no cardiovascular side effects could be seen so far. This is probably due to the absence of vasoconstrictor properties and it also suggests that vasoconstriction is not necessary to abort acute migraine attacks. This lack of direct vasoconstrictor activity may represent an important advantage over the triptans. Further development of drugs against the CGRP receptor will offer a new promising way of treatment.
