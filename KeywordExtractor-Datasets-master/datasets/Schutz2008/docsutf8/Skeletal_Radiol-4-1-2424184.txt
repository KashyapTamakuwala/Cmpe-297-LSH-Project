Objective
The purpose of this study was to determine if a correlation exists between magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of bone marrow edema (BME) in osteoarthrosis (OA) of the knee joint and need for total knee arthroplasty (TKA) within a follow-up period of 3 years.

Materials and methods
The entire database of knee MR studies over a 3-year period was used to select individuals with knee OA. A chart review was conducted to identify and include only those who had a 3-year follow-up appointment from the time of the initial MR study. There were 25 patients in the OA-only group (four men and 21 women; age range, 28–75; average age, 49.3 years). The OA and BME group had 48 patients (23 men and 25 women; average age, 55.5 years). The MRs were reviewed and interpreted by a musculoskeletal radiologist and were classified into one of four patterns of BME: none, focal, global, or cystic pattern. Meniscal tear and degree of cartilage loss were also assessed.

Conclusion
Our classification of patterns into global, focal, cystic, and absence of BME is an attempt to further define edema in osteoarthrosis and how it relates to clinical progression. Patients with BME and OA have an increased risk of TKA as opposed to OA and no marrow edema. The BME pattern with the worst prognosis for the knee is the global pattern.

Despite the recent literature on BME, the implication of these findings on MRI and how they relate to clinical outcomes is unknown. Most studies have used the subjective complaint of pain as the only clinical correlate. There has been no measure of an objective clinical outcome related to the finding of BME. The purpose of this study was to determine if a correlation exists between MRI findings of BME of the knee joint and the incidence of total knee arthroplasty (TKA) within a follow-up period of 3 years.

Materials and methods
The entire database of knee MRI studies from 1995–1997 (over 4,000 studies) conducted at a large urban hospital system was used to select individuals with knee osteoarthrosis (OA). The study was reviewed and approved by the hospital’s institutional review board. An initial random search was conducted within this database to identify two distinct groups of patients. The first group had MRI reports containing the phrase “knee osteoarthrosis/osteoarthritis,” and the second group consisted of those containing the phrases “knee osteoarthrosis/osteoarthritis” and “bone edema.” The search for “osteoarthrosis/osteoarthritis” yielded 235 cases for review. The search for “osteoarthrosis/osteoarthritis” and “bone edema” yielded 146 cases for review. After these two initial groups were identified, a chart review was conducted on all 381 patients to identify and include only those patients who had at least a 3-year clinical follow-up appointment from the time of the MRI study. Subjects were also excluded if the reason for referral to MRI was post-traumatic or post-surgical. An initial review of the images was completed by an experienced musculoskeletal radiologist to exclude any subjects with evidence of recent post-surgical or post-traumatic changes not mentioned in the report. After this chart review and initial radiology review process, there were 38 patients in the OA-only group and 35 in the OA with BME group.
The same musculoskeletal radiologist who provided the initial review was blinded to the original interpretation of the MRI studies and the patient outcome, and reviewed all 73 studies. The radiologist was aware of the study hypothesis at the time of interpretation. The radiologist assessed each knee for the presence or absence of BME and assigned each subject into either the BME group or the no-BME group for further evaluation. After this review of the images, there were a total of 25 patients with OA only and 48 with OA and BME.
The OA-only group consisted of four males and 21 females, with an age range of 28–75 years, and an average age of 49.3 years. Conventional radiographs consisting of anteroposterior, lateral and sunrise views were available for review with 13 of the 25 patients, 52% of the group.
The OA and BME group consisted of 23 men and 25 women, with an age range of 35–82 years and an average age of 53.5 years. Conventional radiographs, again consisting of anteroposterior, lateral, and sunrise views, were available for review with 33 of the 48 patients, 68.75% of the group.

All patients had dedicated knee MR scans either on a GE 1.5-T magnet (23 in the OA-only group or 92% and 42 subjects in the OA with edema group or 87.5%) or a 1.0-T magnet (8% of the OA-only group, two subjects, and 12.5% of the OA with edema group, six patients).
MRI films were reviewed and interpreted by the musculoskeletal radiologist for all patients in the study. For each patient, the sagittal proton density sequences (TR range, 2,666–4,100; TE range, 14–33; 44 conventional spin echo studies [ET = 0], 29 fast spin echo studies [ET = 4–8], 3- to 5-mm section thickness, 16 × 16–18 × 18 field of view [FOV], 256 × 128–256 image matrix, bandwidth range 16–32), coronal proton density sequences (TR range, 2,316–3,950; TE range, 14–33; 44 conventional spin echo studies [ET = 0]; 29 fast spin echo studies[ET = 4–8]; 3-mm section thickness; 16 × 16–18 × 18 FOV; 256 × 128–256 image matrix; bandwidth range, 16–32), and coronal fat suppressed T2-weighted images (TR range, 2,400–3,200; TE range, 56–80; 3- to 5-mm section thickness; 16 × 16–18 × 18 FOV; 256 × 128–256 image matrix; bandwidth range, 15.6–16) were reviewed. Axial fat suppressed T2-weighted images (TR range, 3,000–3,600; TE range, 56–76; 1.5- to 10-mm section thickness; 16 × 16–20 × 20 FOV; 256 × 128–256; bandwidth range, 15.6–16) were available and reviewed for 69 of the 73 knees. For the four subjects who had no axial T2 imaging available, BME in the patellofemoral joint was not assessed.

Generalized estimating equations (GEE) were used to determine which factors were related to receiving a TKA. There were eight subjects who had bilateral knee MRIs. GEE takes into account the correlation within an individual who had both knees involved, whereas a general linear model assumes that all observations are independent and does not allow for multiple observations from one individual. A multivariable logistic regression model using generalized estimation was also used to adjust for the age of the patients and to determine if the results were still significant after accounting for the age differences.

] reviewed MR findings in osteoarthrosis and noted that cartilage lesions, BME patterns, and meniscal and ligamentous lesions were frequently demonstrated as MR changes in patients with advanced osteoarthrosis. However, in this study, there was no significant correlation between MR and clinical findings.

] examined multiple imaging findings and their association with clinical symptoms. Their results suggest that only findings of a large-joint effusion or the presence of an osteophyte in the patellofemoral compartment were associated with pain and/or stiffness. They found no association between BME and symptoms of pain or stiffness.

]. In these experimental lesions, the histopathology revealed 21 osteosclerotic lesions and 5 intraosseous cysts. Histopathological findings showed different degrees of osteosclerosis associated with bone marrow degeneration. Cystic lesions were of two types: subchondral epiphyseal cysts and synovial cysts within a large tibial osteophyte. High signal intensity on T2-weighted images and decreased signal intensity on T1-weighted images indicated high fluid content.
None of these prior studies specifically looked at the BME pattern on MR. Our classification of the patterns into global, focal, cystic, and absence of edema is an attempt to subdivide the presence or absence of edema in osteoarthrosis. However, this attempt is limited by the absence of histopathological findings.
We were surprised by the significantly increased risk of knee joint replacement with the global pattern of BME in relation to the other patterns. It appears that the more extensive and intense the BME, the more likely it is for the patient to have symptoms. The global pattern of BME was the best predictor of risk of TKA within 3 years, as those subjects with the global pattern were over five times as likely to receive a TKA when compared to those with any of the other patterns and over 13 times as likely to have a TKA when compared with subjects with no BME, after accounting for the age difference.

] noted that clinical findings showed no significant correlation with the extent of cartilage loss on MR imaging. In this study, the lowest scores for pain and function loss were found in patients without cartilage lesions. However, the highest scores for pain, stiffness, and function loss were found in patients with less than 50% cartilage loss. The lowest scores for stiffness were found in patients with more than 50% cartilage loss and full-thickness lesions. These findings further support the theory that cartilage loss may not be the primary source of pain in patients with OA of the knee.

]. Furthermore, many patients have pain out of proportion to their radiographic findings. Our study may provide an insight into another possible mechanism for pain production in OA of the knee. While not every patient with OA warrants an MR scan, those patients without the classic presentation may benefit.
We did find that patients who had a TKA were 12.6 years older than those who did not have a TKA. Patients who are older are more likely to have OA and, in particular, more severe OA. Surgical replacement of the knee is more likely to occur in an older patient with OA than a younger patient with the same severity of OA. After further statistical analysis, we however found that our BME results were still significant despite the differences in age.
This paper has several limitations. Most patients who have a TKA do not get a pre-operative MR, and therefore, we may be dealing with a pre-selected population. What we have called “BME” on MR may not be true edema but may relate to other histologic findings as noted earlier. Our numbers are also small, and we had to group some of our subsets together for statistical analysis. Only one musculoskeletal radiologist was involved in the review of the radiology. There was also no arthroscopic correlation for cartilage defects or presence of meniscal tears. Our study is limited by the fact that it is retrospective. To generate a group of MR scans to review, we had to use a keyword search to identify potential subjects. We would have obviously missed all scans where the specific terminology “bone edema” or knee “osteoarthrosis/osteoarthritis” was not utilized. However, we feel that this is a relatively minor limitation, as we were able to generate 381 cases for review. Another potential limitation in the retrospective study design is the possibility of missing subjects who received follow-up at a different institution or those whose symptoms resolved without treatment.
In summary, we reviewed a series of knees in patients with osteoarthrosis and evaluated the pattern of BME, cartilage loss, radiographic findings when available, and the incidence of total knee joint replacement within a 3-year follow-up. Subjects with any bone marrow edema pattern were more likely to have a total knee joint replacement compared to subjects with no bone marrow edema. The worst prognostic pattern was the global pattern of bone marrow edema. Subjects who had a total knee replacement were also older than those who did not. However, even allowing for age, the global pattern of BME remained the variable with the highest statistically significant association with the incidence of total knee replacement.
