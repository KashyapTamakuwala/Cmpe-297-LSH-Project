Biological tissue autograft reconstruction using the patellar tendon or quadrupled semitendinosus/gracilis tendons has become the most popular procedure in surgical treatment of a ruptured ACL. This article provides a review of the history of the use of prosthetics with respect to ACL reconstruction grafts including Carbon Fibre, Gore-Tex and Dacron prosthetics as well as the Leeds-Keio Artificial Ligament and the Kennedy Ligament Augmentation Device (LAD). Emphasis is placed on the Ligament Advanced Reinforcement System (LARS) as preliminary investigations of its use have been encouraging. Significant progress has been made recently with respect to the understanding of ACL anatomy, composition, biomechanics, and healing processes, leading to innovative techniques using approaches based in tissue engineering principles and computer – assisted surgery. While research into improved ACL treatment options continues, the synthesis of recent advancements provides a new optimism towards the regeneration of an ACL mirroring its original stability, function, and longevity.

). Likewise, prosthetic replacements have traditionally tended to be inadequate due to post-surgical complications arising from wear and degeneration. Hence, biological tissue autograft reconstruction using the patellar tendon or quadrupled semitendinosus/gracilis tendons has become the most popular procedure in surgical treatment of an ACL rupture. However, the frequency of significant anterior knee pain post-surgically and high occurrence of flexion contracture and crepitation in tendon autografts have kept research interests focused on the further development of prosthetic ligament implants. A significant number of early research endeavours into prosthetic ACL replacements failed due to a poor understanding of the biomechanical and physiological properties of the ACL. Tremendous gains in understanding have been made in these areas, with significant progress being made in understanding the inter-dependence between ACL anatomy, tissue composition, biomechanics, and the healing processes. Unfortunately, to date, no prosthesis has proven itself as a viable alternative to the patellar or hamstring tendon autografts, currently used in over 90% of ACL reconstructions. This article reviews some of the major historical milestones in ACL reconstruction technology and looks forward to the continuing evolution of this technology. The literature used for this review was obtained using the PubMED database with keywords “anterior cruciate ligament” searched in tandem separately with “prosthetics” and “tissue engineering.” It should be noted that many of the studies cited in this review obtained funding from orthopaedic and biomaterial companies that sponsored the implant.

Although preliminary investigations into the use of the LARS artificial ligament have been encouraging, concerns regarding the risk of rupture remain and must be addressed through long-term follow-up studies.

TISSUE ENGINEERING ADVANCES

). An ideal ACL scaffold must meet the immediate functional mechanical demands within the reconstructed knee, however, they must also degrade at a rate similar to that of tissue ingrowth. Accordingly, the ACL scaffold should lose its mechanical integrity while allowing the remodelled tissues to gain strength and accept an increasing amount of the mechanical demands placed on the ACL. Current research into this novel tissue-engineering approach has focused on seeding either collagen-based scaffolds or synthetic biodegradable polymers with a variety of different cell types. In hopes of stimulating early healing, reducing biomaterial-related inflammatory response and improving neoligament formation, several researchers have sought to adopt a cell sheeting technique to improve the performance of the synthetic ACL scaffold.

). These authors observed that the addition of transforming growth factor (TGF)β-1 led to an increased cell population, as well as increased collagen and smooth muscle actin production in human ACL cells cultured on top of a collagen-glycosaminoglycan scaffold. Despite the complex nature of the inter-dependent factors at play during the recovery and rehabilitative period following an ACL reconstruction, much of the literature today suggests that tissue engineering techniques will lead to a new generation of ACL replacements, capable of regenerating a mechanically robust and natural ACL.

COMPUTER-ASSISTED ACL RECONSTRUCTION

). Based on the success of navigation systems for total knee and hip replacements, the use of computer-assisted ACL reconstruction may lead to similarly dramatic improvements in technical and functional outcomes.

CONCLUSION
40
). Tissue ingrowth scaffolds and ligament augmentation devices require further refinement to provide effective mechanical support while avoiding stress-shielding of the host tissue. In view of these factors, prosthetics are not widely used today in ACL reconstruction, and autogenous tissue grafts remain the gold standard used by the majority of surgeons. Perhaps development of resorbable, tissue-inducing and cell-seeded biomaterials will improve the long-term biomechanical performance of the reconstructed anterior cruciate ligament. Advances in tissue engineering combined with developments in molecular biology and gene therapy may couple with the rapid gains in computer-assisted surgery to provide improved options for the ACL-deficient knee, with a greater potential to restore its pre-injury state.
