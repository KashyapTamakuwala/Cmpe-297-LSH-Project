Introduction
The aim of the study was to compare the mortality risk and complication rate after operative treatment of pertrochanteric fractures with primary arthroplasty, dynamic hip screw (DHS) or proximal femoral nail (PFN).

Patients and methods
Clinical records including X-rays of all patients with trochanteric femoral fractures, except pathologic fractures and a minimum age of 60 years, which were treated between 1992 and 2005 were entered in this retrospective study. Of these 283 patients, 132 were treated by primary arthroplasty, 109 with a DHS and 42 with a PFN. Survival after 1 year and complications, which had to be treated within this period were our main outcome measurement. Influencing cofactors such as age, gender and comorbidities were reduced by multivariate logistic regression analysis.

Results
Mortality was significantly influenced by age, gender and amount of comorbidities but not by fracture classification. Primary hip arthroplasty did not bear a higher 1-year mortality risk than osteosynthesis in a multiple regression analysis. The main complication with DHS and PFN were cutting out of the hip screw and non-union with a revision rate of 12.8%. With the introduction of hemiarthroplasty, the postoperative dislocation rate decreased from 12 to 0%.

Conclusion
For stable fractures a dynamic hip screw (DHS) and for unstable fractures a short proximal femoral nail (PFN) can be recommended. The mortality risk of primary cemented arthroplasty did not differ significantly from the other treatment groups and because of its low complication rate it is a viable treatment option for trochanteric fractures if osteoporosis prevents from full weight bearing or if osteoarthritis makes further operations likely. Primary total hip replacement should be handled with care due to its significantly higher dislocation rate compared with hemiarthroplasty especially in unstable fractures.

Patients and methods
A total of 308 patients who were treated for trochanteric femoral fractures between 1992 and 2005 with a minimum age of 60 years were enrolled in this study. Seventeen patients with pathologic fractures due to metastases were excluded. Information about survival after 1 year could be achieved from 283 of the 291 patients.

). The relative risk to die was decreased for A.1- and A.2-type fractures, treated with a DHS, but this did not reach significance levels. As only seven patients with a A.1-type fracture were treated with a PFN (and all of them survived), no sensible statistical analysis can be done for this category. As all devices showed good results for this kind of fracture, the decision should be based on other parameters for A.1-type fractures.

The DHS had a revision rate of 8.1%, while the PFN needed reoperations in nine cases (22.5%). The main reason was cutting out of the screw in the osteoporotic bone and postoperative hematoma. Due to cutting out and fixation failure secondary hip arthroplasty was performed after failed internal fixation ten times. It happened six times (5.4%) after a DHS and four times (9.8%) after a PFN.

In their small group of 54 patients they found a mortality rate of 31.5% within 1 year which did not differ from comparable age-matched studies. The walking ability of their patients was favorable compared with other studies with internal fixation. We agree that immediate full weight bearing, which can be achieved after cemented arthroplasty, is crucial for these patients.

Examples of treatment of A2-type fractures with a hemiendoprosthesis and tension band wires. Depending on the fracture type different ways of fixating the trochanteric region with wires were used. In the case of a calcar fragment reaching distal to the lesser trochanter a temporary reduction with a cerclage wire or reduction bone clamp was used before reaming. Final fixation of the greater trochanter was performed after reduction of the hip with cerclages or a tension band

]. We further support the recommendation that the DHS should be used for stable A1- and A2.1-type fractures while an intramedullary device is advantageous for unstable fractures. Primary cemented arthroplasty is a viable option for the treatment of trochanteric fractures in a selected group of previously independent mobile patients especially if osteoporosis would prevent full weight bearing or osteoarthritis would make further operations necessary. The routine use of total hip arthroplasty was abandoned in our hospital as the luxation rate was higher than after hemiarthroplasty. It is still used as salvage procedure after failed internal fixation in elder patients with bad bone quality.
