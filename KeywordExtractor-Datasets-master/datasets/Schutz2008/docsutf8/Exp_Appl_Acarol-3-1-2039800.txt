 observed from data obtained from four sites on each coconut fruit was the most relevant variable to be taken into account in the data analysis. Generalized Linear Models (GLM) were used to test differences in the perianth-fruit gap between main factors (category of coconut fruits i.e. infested and uninfested coconut fruits and cultivar) and to assess the interactions between the main factors.

 = 0.436). This means that among the infested coconut fruits the perianth-fruit gap is not a reliable predictor of the density of predatory mites under the perianth. The absence of a correlation is not unexpected because the density records are snapshots of a dynamic process involving interactions between predator and prey. Sampling randomly over the time course of such an interaction is bound to show no correlation.

). Hence, the perianth-fruit gap in uninfested coconut fruits of any of the three cultivars is large enough for mature coconut mites to enter the space under the perianth. Hence, we expect the sub-perianth space of the three cultivars in our study to be equally accessible to mature coconut mites.

 have a soma small enough to pass the perianth-fruit gap of uninfested coconut fruits. However, juvenile predatory mites are unlikely to be the first invaders under the perianth, because they are much less mobile than adults and because female predatory mites can only lay eggs when there is a sufficient supply of prey. Adult females are therefore more likely to be the first to colonize a coconut, but they cannot enter sub-perianth space unless coconut mites have established. Hence, initially coconut mites experience reduced risk of being eaten by predatory mites when feeding on the tissue beneath the perianth.

, irrespective of coconut mite infestation. Whereas this shows that increased gap size is not a simple consequence of necrosis and suberization of the meristimatic tissue beneath the perianth, it does not disprove this hypothesis (e.g. feeding effects on perianth structure may depend on the structure itself) and—as yet—there is no evidence for the ‘induction’ hypothesis.

). We therefore hypothesize that the maximum perianth-fruit gap created by the coconut palm represents a compromise between benefits in terms of protection by predatory mites and costs in terms of desiccation, increased diversity of herbivores and impact of intraguild predators of the effective predators of coconut mites.
