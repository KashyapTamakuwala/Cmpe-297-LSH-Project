Severe Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) remains a major cause of death and disability afflicting mostly young adult males and elderly people, resulting in high economic costs to society. Therapeutic approaches focus on reducing the risk on secondary brain injury. Specific ethical issues pertaining in clinical testing of pharmacological neuroprotective agents in TBI include the emergency nature of the research, the incapacity of the patients to informed consent before inclusion, short therapeutic time windows, and a risk-benefit ratio based on concept that in relation to the severity of the trauma, significant adverse side effects may be acceptable for possible beneficial treatments. Randomized controlled phase III trials investigating the safety and efficacy of agents in TBI with promising benefit, conducted in acute emergency situations with short therapeutic time windows, should allow randomization under deferred consent or waiver of consent. Making progress in knowledge of treatment in acute neurological and other intensive care conditions is only possible if national regulations and legislations allow waiver of consent or deferred consent for clinical trials.

The importance of implications of these issues is not fully recognized outside, and even within, the expert field of treatment of severe TBI.
Therapeutic trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pharmacological agents are subject to the ethical and juridical principles of Good Clinical Practice, national legislation and European and international regulations. The guiding ethical principles underlying these investigations of treatment are respect for autonomy of the subjects, protection against discomfort, harm, risk and exploitation and the prospect of benefit. The prospect of benefit is almost always complicated by the equipoise underpinning the statistical null hypothesis of pharmacological trials: the hope that an individual patient will benefit, but that this is not more certain than the chance of non benefit.

The Directive made no direct exception for emergency and critical care situations, and therefore threatened to prevent all emergency trials involving patients with acute catastrophic illness causing loss of decision-making capacity and facing (very) short therapeutic time windows, such as severe shock, circulatory arrest, acute myocardial infarction, severe stroke and other acute neurological conditions, and moderate and severe traumatic brain injury.

]. The amended WMO will change the rules governing drugs studies in The Netherlands. There will be little, if any, change to non-drug research. The Dutch Parliament has accepted the amended WMO for the implementation (amended WMO) at November 22, 2005 and the revised Act became effective in The Netherlands on March 1, 2006.
The Directive was conceived in part to ensure that participants enrolled in research projects are given adequate information about the nature of the trials and the associated risks. Legislation to protect the interests of patients was necessary and timely. The research community welcomed most of the Articles in the Directive; they offer guidance and will help to maintain confidence in the probity of medical research. Unfortunately, however, neither those responsible for the Directive, nor many who drafted enabling legislation within Member States, considered the special problems relating to research in emergency nor critical care situations, where consent cannot be obtained from subjects and where the need for emergency treatment does not allow time for contact with relatives or other legal representatives. Moreover, in the United States, in 1996, the FDA had published a waiver of informed consent for certain types of emergency and critical care research after earlier strict provisions had brought to a halt important progress in some critical clinical situations.

The Emergency Nature of Research in TBI
Traumatic Brain Injury is by definition an acute condition. The emergency nature of pharmacological research in TBI is reflected by the fact that experimental and clinical studies have shown that patho-physiological cascades are initiated within minutes to hours following primary injury. Time windows for treatment modalities are therefore considered to be short. Experimental studies have shown the efficacy of many neuroprotective agents, if these were administered before, or within 15 min after injury; others have shown a window of efficacy of 3–6 h.

] Informed consent could, seen the severity of the brain injury, not be obtained from the patients. Proxy consent was accepted in all participating countries. Deferred patient or proxy consent was only allowed in Australia, Austria, Finland, France and Germany and consent by an independent physician was allowed in Israel, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom. In all cases of deferred consent, subsequent written assent by patient or proxy was obtained.

Conclusions
Specific ethical issues pertaining in clinical testing of pharmacological neuroprotective agents in TBI include the emergency nature of the research, the incapacity of the patients to informed consent before inclusion, short therapeutic time windows, and a risk-benefit ratio based on concept that in relation to the severity of the trauma, significant adverse side effects may be acceptable for treatments with possible benefit.

]. These requirements assume that relatives are available in emergency situations, and that these relatives can be fully informed and given sufficient time to make a balanced decision in a relatively short time period. The conflict between the desire for early initiation of experimental treatment versus the time required for following consent procedures and the conflict between the desire for following consent procedures requiring prior consent and the doubts about the validity of proxy consent in acute situations are the most problematic aspects of emergency research in TBI.
