]. Coculture of HSCs with stromal cell lines is a useful system to study hematopoiesis in the niche. Although physical contact between HSCs and stromal cell lines has been demonstrated to be essential, little is known regarding the precise cellular and molecular mechanisms of maintaining HSCs by stromal cell lines.

 ligand, stem cell factor (SCF). In this study, microarray analysis was performed to identify genes responsible for supporting HSC activity of PA6 cells. Eleven genes specifically down-regulated in the subclone cells were selected and characterized by overexpressing the corresponding cDNAs in the subclone cells.

Materials and methods
Mice
C57BL/6 (B6-Ly5.2) mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories Japan (Yokohama, Japan). C57BL/6 mice congenic for the Ly5 locus (B6-Ly5.1) were obtained from RIKEN BRC. B6-Ly5.1/Ly5.2 F1 mice were obtained from mating pairs of B6-Ly5.1 and B6-Ly5.2 mice. All animal experiments were approved by the Animal Experiment Committee of the RIKEN Tsukuba Institute.

]. PA6 subclone cells were transduced with lentiviral vectors expressing cDNAs at a multiplicity of infection of 200 and >90% of transduction efficiency was confirmed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis for Venus expression.

 cells/well) irradiated with 1.5 Gy and were cocultured in 150 μL of MEM-α containing 20% FBS.

Colony-forming cell assay

KSL HSCs were collected and plated in a 12-well plate containing 0.6 mL of methylcellulose medium (MethoCult GF M3434) (StemCell Technologies, Vancouver, Canada) containing 50 ng/mL rmSCF, 10 ng/mL rmIL-3, 10 ng/mL rhIL-6, and 3 units/mL rhEPO. After 12 days of incubation, colonies were recovered, cytospun onto glass slides, and then subjected to Hemacolor (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) staining for morphological examination. Colony-forming unit-granulocyte, erythrocyte, monocyte, megakaryocyte (CFU-GEMM), CFU-granulocyte, erythrocyte, monocyte (CFU-GEM), CFU-granulocyte, monocyte (CFU-GM), CFU-granulocyte (CFU-G), CFU-monocyte (CFU-M), and burst forming unit-erythrocyte (BFU-E) were scored using standard scoring criteria. The total colony number was expressed as colony-forming cell (CFC).

 cells. When the percent chimerism was >1.0% for all myeloid, B-lymphoid, and T-lymphoid lineages, recipient mice were considered to be multilineage reconstituted.

Microarray analysis
Total RNA was isolated from stromal cells using the ISOGEN reagent (Nippon Gene, Tokyo, Japan) and purified with the RNeasy MinElute cleanup kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Biotin-labeled cRNA was prepared from 1 μg of the purified total RNA with a one-cycle cDNA synthesis kit and 3′-amplification reagents for IVT labeling (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) and was hybridized to an Affymetrix Gene Chip Mouse Genome 430 2.0 array (Affymetrix), which contains approximately 45,000 probe sets for analyzing the expression levels of more than 34,000 mouse genes. After washing and staining with the antibody amplification procedure, the microarrays were scanned with an Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G. All these procedures were carried out according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The expression value (Signal) and detection call (Present (P), Absent (A), or Marginal (M)) for each probe set were calculated using GeneChip Operating Software version 1.4 (Affymetrix). The Signal values were normalized so that their mean in each experiment was 100 in order to adjust for minor differences between the experiments. The change value (Signal Log Ratio) and change call (Increase, Marginal Increase, No Change, Marginal Decrease, or Decrease) for each probe set were calculated by Comparison Analysis of the software. All experiments were performed in duplicate using two independent cell samples. To identify differentially expressed genes, we selected probe sets that showed a change call of Decrease and a Signal Log Ratio value of ≤–1 (more than twofold down-regulation) or a change call of Increase and a Signal Log Ratio value of ≥1 (more than twofold up-regulation) in each of the two independent experiments.

, demonstrated a partial restoration of the defect in HSC-supporting activity of PA6 S-2 cells, it is possible that other down-regulated genes in PA6 subclone cells may also be required for the maintenance of HSCs. Continuing studies to identify genes responsible for HSC-supporting activity of PA6 cells would facilitate the understanding of the mechanisms that control stem cell fate through interaction with stromal cells.
