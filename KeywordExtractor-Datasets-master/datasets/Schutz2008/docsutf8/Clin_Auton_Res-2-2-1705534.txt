].
The aim of this study was to collect normative SSR data. SSRs were measured in both mid-palms following electrical stimulation of the left medial nerve and magnetic stimulation of the neck in healthy controls. SSR onset and peak latency, amplitude and area were analyzed. Electrically generated SSR in the ipsilateral (left) and contralateral (right) palms were compared to the SSR evoked by magnetic stimulation.

Methods
Subjects
Forty healthy adult volunteers [9 males/21 females, mean age 52.21 ± 12.23 (range 28–75) years, height 172 ± 11.3 cm] were studied. All subjects were healthy, with no history of cardiovascular or neurological disease. All subjects denied previous alcohol or drug abuse. None of the subjects had contraindications for magnetic stimulation, such as metal prosthesis or pacemaker. All participants gave written informed consent prior to the start of the study.

Procedure
20
]. Briefly, subjects lay supine in an air-conditioned, quiet room with temperature maintained at 24°C and skin temperature at 33 ± 0.5°C. The same investigator performed all experiments, and care was taken to avoid all external stimulation. Active standard disk ECG Ag/AG/Cl electrodes were attached to the mid-palm of both hands and referenced to the corresponding dorsal surfaces. Skin temperature was verified as being above 32°C by measuring close to the recording electrodes. The recording sites were the same in all experiments.

Electrical stimulation
Single square-wave electrical pulses of 0.1 milliseconds duration were applied to the left median nerve at the wrist at irregular intervals (30–60 seconds) to produce a SSR. The sweep speed was 1,000 milliseconds/D, the amplifiers sensitivity was 100 μV/div and the amplifier filters were set at 0.5 Hz and 2 kHz for the low and high frequency filter, respectively. Five trials were recorded simultaneously from both palms and on each side the response with the largest amplitude and shortest latency were taken. A fixed stimulus intensity of 60 mA was used throughout.

Magnetic stimulation
A Magstim 200 stimulator, equipped with a circular coil of 9 cm inner diameter and a 2.0-T maximum magnetic field strength, was used to apply magnetic stimulation at the cervical area. The center of the circular coil was placed in the midline over the 7th cervical spinous process. The current was set to anti-clockwise flow in the coil (side A visible) and the stimulus intensity fixed at 60% of maximum output. Five stimuli were delivered randomly every 20–30 seconds.

Analysis of waveforms
To avoid habituation 5 minutes rest was given between electrical and magnetic stimulation. To maintain uniformity of the results only “P” type responses (waveforms with a larger positive, compared to negative, component) were analyzed.

Amplitude and area
During electrical stimulation amplitude was higher of the stimulated (left) side compared to the non-stimulated side. Amplitude was similar during magnetic and contralateral electrical stimulation. The area of the SSR measured at the right side was greater for magnetic stimulation compared to electrical stimulation.


Discussion
The main finding of this study was that the latency of a SSR depends on whether an electrical or magnetic evoking stimulus is used. We also found a mean latency difference between contralateral and ipsilateral evoked electrical responses of 105 milliseconds.

].
In our study, the latency of the SSR evoked by magnetic stimulation was shorter than the corresponding values of the electrically elicited responses. The shorter latency of the magnetically generated SSR could be caused by impulses bypassing the peripheral afferent part of the reflex. Given that the difference between electrical stimulation at the wrist and magnetic stimulation at the neck was 158 milliseconds and assuming that the average distance from wrist to C7 is 70 cm, the conduction velocity of afferent somatic fibers is calculated to be approximately 5 m/second.

], with the former being always longer.
Based on our results, it can be assumed that the SSR onset latency to spinal cord magnetic stimulation was the shortest, whereas that to contralateral peripheral nerve electrical stimulation was the longest. Furthermore, the difference in latency between SSR to magnetic and ipsilateral electrical stimuli was close to that between SSR to ipsilateral and contralateral electrical stimuli. A satisfactory explanation for the observed differences would not be offered without the risk of being highly speculative.

]. To ensure similarity of measurements and facilitate comparison of responses to different kinds of stimuli, we arbitrarily choose to study only subjects with predominant P type responses. In none of our participants the change of stimulation from electrical (ipsilateral and contralateral) to magnetic resulted in switching of P to N type of SSR. This can be the consequence of using relatively high intensity in electrical and magnetic stimulus.

]. Under the particular recording conditions applied, the majority of the examined individuals had potentials with an initial positive peak. Therefore, instead of measuring the onset latency to the first negative peak, which is most often used, we measured the onset latency from stimulus artifact to the onset of the main positive wave irrespective of the existence or not of a proceeding small negative component. As regards to the peak latency values, they showed similar to onset latency differences in this study. Thus, peak latency is not suggested as an additional parameter, which could be useful in clinical practice.

These findings could be attributed to the stable conditions of recordings (single session for all SSR recordings in each subject and long interstimulus interval to avoid habituation).

]. In the filed of autonomic nervous system where the diagnostic options are limited, and despite the expression of certain doubts, mainly related to the large diversion of individual values, SSR remains at present the most widely applied neurophysiological test for the sympathetic nervous system. According to the results of the present study, latency which is the most widely quoted parameter, varied depending on the stimulation type, being shorter at ipsilateral than contralateral electrical stimulus and even less short when magnetic stimulation at the neck was applied. Further studies on the challenging issue of SSR waveform and its possible clinical relevance are necessary to explore it in detail.
