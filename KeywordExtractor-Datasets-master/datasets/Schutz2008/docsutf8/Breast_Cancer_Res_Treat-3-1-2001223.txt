Trial design and patients
21
]. The trial was conducted in 55 centers in 16 countries between March 1998 and August 1999. Local ethics review boards approved the protocol and all patients gave written informed consent before study enrollment.
Randomized clinical trial design
21
]. Patients were considered to have completed the study when they had received 4 months of treatment and had been assessed for surgery. Following surgery, patients were treated at the investigator’s discretion and were followed for 5 years for local recurrence, distant metastasis, and survival.

It appears that cell-cycle regulation is partially or completely estrogen-independent in the majority of primary tumors showing HER2 gene amplification, and patients with such tumors may eventually develop resistance to adjuvant AI therapy. Novel strategies to delay or overcome hormone resistance are described elsewhere in this supplement, in the article, “Femara and the future.”

The P024 trial has clearly demonstrated the therapeutic superiority of letrozole over tamoxifen for the neoadjuvant management of primary breast cancer. The trial has also provided the oncology community with a validated research setting within which to gain valuable insights into the molecular features of ER+ breast cancer and its treatment that will help shape new therapies in the years to come.
