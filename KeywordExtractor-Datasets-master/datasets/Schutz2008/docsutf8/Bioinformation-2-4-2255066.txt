        A neurological disorder is a disorder caused by the deterioration of certain nerve cells called neurons. Changes in these cells cause them to function abnormally, eventually bringing 
        about their death. In this paper we present a comprehensive database for neurodegenerative diseases, a first-of-its kind covering all known or suspected genes, proteins, pathways related 
        to neurodegenerative diseases. This dynamically compiled database allows researchers to link neurological disorders to the candidate genes & proteins. It serves as a tool to navigate potential 
        gene-protein-pathway relationships in the context of neurodegenerative diseases. The neurodegenerative disorder database covers more then 100 disease concepts including synonyms and research topics. 
        The current version of the database provides links to 728 abstracts and over 203 unique genes/proteins with 137 drugs. Also it is integrated well with other related databases. The aim of this 
        database is to provide the researcher with a quick overview of potential links between genes and proteins with related neurodegenerative diseases. Thus DND providing a user-friendly interface is 
        designed as a source to enhance research on neurodegenerative disorders.

] The treatment strategies for these disorders include therapies and drugs. Because of the 
complexity involved in the neurodegenerative disease mechanism and treatment strategies, it is of interest to collate different Neurodegenerative Disorders in the form of a database. Hence we developed DND 
(Database of Neurodegenerative Disorders), an on-line web based database that contains more than 100 neuro related disease concepts and provides with a covering of all related genes, proteins, pathways and drug information.

]. MySQL tables are shown as rectangles. Mandatory attributes are in bold, optional are in italics. The relationships between tables in the database are shown as connecting 
lines. The public databases NCBI, SwissProt, Kegg and DrugBank are used for populating the database. The gene sequences related to various neurological disorders are obtained from NCBI. Both gene sequence and coding 
sequence can be obtained in Fasta format. Also HGNC links for each entry is provided. All protein sequences are extracted from UniProt, and fields that mapped to PDB, Pfam, Interpro, Prints and Smart are parsed and 
stored. Links from DND to these source databases are also provided for each entry. Fasta format of protein sequences too can be obtained. Pathway information for Neurodegenerative diseases as well as known neuro 
related drug compounds in KEGG is searched and the results obtained are incorporated in to the database. The articles are chosen to represent a diverse selection of reports on major Neurodegenerative diseases and 
corresponding Pubmed ID is provided for all the entries. Neurological Associations and Organizations interested in neuroscience-related fields are tabulated with links to their corresponding web pages.


Searching DND
There are three ways by which the user can query the database. The first one is the keyword search in home page that can be performed by giving keywords like Disease name, Gene name and Drug name to retrieve the 
required data. The second one is the advanced search option for specific requirements with two main entry points namely gene/protein and drug/drug properties. Gene/protein include search options like Gene name, Gene id, 
Omim, Hgnc, Pubmed, Swissprot id, Pdb, Interpro, Pfam, Smart and Prints. The second entry point Drug/drug properties include Drug name, Kegg id, DrugBank id, Pubchem, and IUPAC name and Molecular formula. Alternatively, 
the users can also browse the database via the seven entry points namely browse by Diseases, Genes, Proteins, Drugs, Pathways, Related Articles and Organizations.

] that allows chemical structures to rotate, reformat, and save in various file formats. A glossary describing the terms used in database is also provided to help 
the end users. We believe that DND will assist the intended neurological researchers in understanding of fundamental molecular and genetic processes that control various neurodegenerative diseases.
