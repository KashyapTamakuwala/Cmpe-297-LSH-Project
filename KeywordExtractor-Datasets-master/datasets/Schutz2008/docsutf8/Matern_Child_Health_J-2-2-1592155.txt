Introduction
1
], the notion of preconception care can be found in various global policy and practice recommendations concerning women's health and child survival. Although programs and guidelines may vary in response to local needs, the overarching concept of preconception care is present among developing and industrialized countries, within socialized or market-based health care systems, and independent of political, cultural, or religious beliefs. Furthermore, the incorporation of various preconception care strategies and ideologies within international maternal and child health programs and policies spans nearly 30 years, indicating a long-term recognition of the relative importance of such interventions as a means of optimizing pregnancy outcomes.
2
], the development of preconception health initiatives must be traced through the history of various international health movements, starting with the promotion of global primary health care, followed by Safe Motherhood initiatives, and culminating with the women's rights and health movements. Thus, whereas the activities described herein may not be immediately identifiable as preconception care, they represent essential pieces of the preconception health puzzle.

Materials and methods
A MEDLINE search with English language and human subject restriction was conducted for the years 1980 through May 9, 2005 using the reference terms “preconception (pre-conception) care,” “preconception counseling,” “preconceptional care,” “periconception care,” and “periconceptional care.” A total of 756 citations were identified using the initial search parameters. References for which preconception care programs or activities outside of the United States comprised the primary topic of interest were included. Articles detailing clinical or scientific evidence of specific periconceptional interventions were excluded. Also reviewed were other published articles as well as textbook chapters, declarations, reports, and recommendations not retrievable from these databases. The search terms were also entered in various internet search engines and relevant web-based information was used to supplement the findings. Pertinent abstracts from the National Summit on Preconception Care (CDC, June 2005) were also reviewed.

Results
A total of 42 articles, book chapters, declarations, and other published materials were reviewed. The findings were categorized into three main areas in order to present the material in a coherent fashion: international conferences and accords, professional organizations, and international preconception care programs.

]. For example, many African countries provide continuing education to community health care workers to help them deal with issues in preconception counseling and reproductive choices for patients with HIV.

]. Maternal mortality in these countries is cited as one of the primary causes of death among women 15 to 39 years of age. Using a $250,000 grant provided by WHO, these countries have undertaken a demonstration project to deliver preconception health education via community programs. The specific aims of the project are to develop and deliver a comprehensive preconception care package that includes (1) risk assessment (identify individual, family, and social risks and barriers to prenatal care); (2) health promotion (ensure proper nutrition; avoid substance, tobacco, and alcohol use; provide family planning; perform PAP smear screening, and provide ongoing care); and (3) treatment delivery (treat medical conditions and infections such as malaria and sexually transmitted diseases, update immunizations, provide nutritional supplementation such as folic acid, and conduct home visits).

The present description of international programs and perspectives on preconception care is limited in scope by numerous factors. The literature search was as comprehensive as possible but not exhaustive because of language restrictions, difficulty in retrieving documentation of international preconception care programs and policies, the relative scarcity of published information about international preconception care practices, and the myriad of maternal and child health outcomes that fall under the umbrella of preconception health and for which both population-based and targeted interventions exist. Finally, data pertaining to maternal and infant outcomes after the introduction of preconception care activities is often unavailable. Thus, this review provides only a broad overview of international activities related to preconception health. However, the findings are instructive as a preliminary step in the compilation and dissemination of information related to international preconception care recommendations and practices. Future research should include a regionalized inspection and comparison of preconception care programs, policies, and recommendations within and among various countries. The impact of these programs on community-specific indicators of maternal and perinatal health should also be evaluated.

]. Indeed, the perspective that preconception care is part of a larger continuum of care is well aligned with a prevention-focused public health paradigm. As such, the widespread promotion of preconception health may be the most timely and logical step toward ensuring global health.
