ABSTRACT Many tools exist for visually exploring biological networks including well-known examples such as Cytoscape, VisANT, Pathway Studio and Patika. These systems play a key role in the development of integrative biology, systems biology and integrative bioinformatics. The trend in the development of these tools is to go beyond `static' representations of cellular state, towards a more dynamic model of cellular processes through the incorporation of gene expression data, subcellular localization information and time-dependent behavior. We provide a comprehensive review of the relative advantages and disadvantages of existing systems with two goals in mind: to aid researchers in efficiently identifying the appropriate existing tools for data visualization; to describe the necessary and realistic goals for the next generation of visualization tools. In view of the first goal, we provide in the Supplementary Material a systematic comparison of more than 35 existing tools in terms of over 25 different features.

INTRODUCTION

Networks are used ubiquitously throughout biology to represent the relationships between genes and gene products. Perhaps due to their simple discrete nature and to their amenability to visual representation, biological networks allow for the most salient properties of complex systems to be highlighted in a succinct and powerful manner. Visualization of biological networks range from small-scale descriptions of specific metabolic, regulatory or signalling pathways appearing in countless journal articles, seminars and courses, to classic efforts such as the Roche Applied Science Biochemical Pathways (Michal, 1993) and the Biochemical Pathway Atlas (Michal, 1998) that attempt to provide broad maps of cellular organization. Whereas these latter efforts required extensive manual curation to iteratively refine the maps as new information became available, the advent of high-throughput genetic-based assays that permit (near) cellwide exploration of relationships between genes and gene products has motivated the development of software systems capable of constructing visualizations of these datasets `on the fly'. Assays such as genetic-based protein­protein interaction

screens [e.g. (Fields and kyu Song, 1989; Rigaut et al., 1999; Selbach and Mann, 2006)], RNAi-based genetic interaction screens (Echeverri and Perrimon, 2006; Fire et al., 1998) gene expression (Lockhart et al., 1996) and ChIP-Chip arrays (Blat and Kleckner, 1999; Ren et al., 2000) are readily visualized when nodes represent genes, gene products or small molecules and, links (edges) between pairs of nodes can model metabolic events, protein­protein/protein­nucleotide interactions, regulatory relationships or signaling pathways. Such simple networks, that capture a static `snapshot' of cellular state, have been shown capable of yielding insight into the underlying biology. Network analysis, e.g. has shown that many types of biological networks across a broad spectrum of organisms share important graph-theoretic properties. These properties suggest testable biological hypotheses that may in turn reveal the fundamental design principles of biological systems. For example, there is evidence that many types ´ of biological networks are scale-free (Barabasi and Oltvai, 2004), containing a few highly connected nodes (`hubs') and a majority of nodes linked to only a few neighbors ´ (Barabasi and Albert, 1999). The fundamental hypothesis here is that scale-free networks are `robust' to random node removals, since a majority of the nodes are not essential to cellular function and simultaneously `fragile' because targeted removal of a few hubs will disrupt cellular function. This `robust yet fragile' network property is thought by some to be responsible for the ability of biological systems to survive a wide variety of attacks while being susceptible to a few specific targeted attacks (Albert et al., 2000). Network models have facilitated a shift from the study of evolutionary conservation between individual gene and gene products towards the study of conservation at the level of pathways and complexes. In particular, Kelley et al. (2003) show that the protein­protein interaction networks of two distantly related species, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Helicobacter pylori, contain many of the same or very similar pathways. In many of these conserved pathways, the S.cerevisiae network appears to be more specialized. Resultant tools such as PathBLAST (Kelley et al., 2004) are now commonly used to automate the discovery of similarities (`alignments') within and between protein­protein interaction networks. These and other successes indicate that network modeling is a promising approach, however, visualization in this domain remains a difficult challenge for several reasons. First, the increasing number of interactions available for even small genomes/proteomes presents significant visualization challenges.

Fig. 1. Protein­protein interaction map showing predicted subcellularlocalizations of all proteins in the secretory pathway (Scott et al., 2005a). The drawing was created using the Cytoscape plugin Cerebral (Barsky et al., 2007). Subcellular compartments are ordered so that compartments with the most inter-compartmental links are next to one another.

For practical reasons, including simplicity and computational tractability, most network models cannot handle such n-ary relations. Consequently, general methods of extending models such as by using n-ary relations are not practical. Extensions based on domain-specific knowledge is required. Finally, there is a general need for the biological network tools to incorporate more dynamic information within the network. A first step in this direction is the inclusion of gene expression data within several existing visualization tools. The mapping of gene expression (represented typically by color) onto network nodes can be viewed as our first glimpse of large-scale systems-wide dynamics in biological systems. However, current functionality is not capable of addressing the computational and statistical challenges that will arise as researchers begin to construct largescale probabilistic and dynamic models of complicated, distributed biological processes, nor is it capable of addressing how dynamic models may be visually represented. The purpose of this review is 2-fold. First, it is designed to provide readers with an overview of existing software systems for biological network visualization (Section 2). The existence of at least 35 such systems precludes an in-depth review of each, instead we have sought to single out systems that contain unique functionality that have broad applicability in many different studies. Furthermore, we discuss some of the most important features currently available in network visualization packages and summarize the tools that support them (Section 3). Second, we discuss the future of network visualization and how current tools can be improved to satisfy future demands (Section 4).

Most available biological network tools make use of generic visualization packages (and algorithms) from the graph drawing community to address problems of scalability. However, such generic layouts often produce network drawings that resemble the infamous `hair ball', since the layout optimization criteria fail to take into consideration important domain-specific knowledge such as subcellular localizations, molecular functions, protein complexes or pathways (see Fig. 1). Second, we lack robust query languages embedded directly within the visualization software. These querying languages allow users to filter cell-wide networks, thus restricting their attention to a core set of nodes of particular interest and to organize this information in an intuitive manner. Third, the increasing number of types of interactions raises many practical and theoretical problems related to how these datasets should be integrated into network models, how this information is best visualized and how the network can be explored. For instance, consider the visualization of a biological network containing both physical and genetic interactions. The fact that protein­protein interactions occur between molecules that are at least transiently physically co-located in the cell may suggest an approach that seeks to generate a visualization that mimics cellular or organellar location. However, such an approach may be unsuitable for genetic interactions where the interacting proteins may be implicated in two distinct, distally located pathways. Other types of biological interactions are not necessarily well modeled by simple binary, pairwise graphs (i.e. 2-hypergraphs). Consider, e.g. expressing that a certain ternary complex forms if and only if each of the three components of the complex are present.

TOOL SURVEY

There are many network visualization tools and each meets some specific visualization need. In fact, during the preparation of this manuscript, we identified no less than 35 such tools, and the number continues to grow. A similar review (Saraiya et al., 2005) published only a few years ago identifies barely half that number and, due to recent progress in this area, is silent on some of what are currently the most important visualization challenges. We focus here on six tools which together contain many of the important features necessary for network visualization in a broad range of studies. A more complete list can be found in the Supplementary Material. Pathway Studio (Nikitin et al., 2003) (formerly PathwayAssist) is a Microsoft Windows application that combines an extensive set of features with a polished graphic user interface. It includes, most notably, customizable network display styles for assigning visual attributes such as node color, size and shape, multi-user support, subcellular localization visualization and tight integration with several database including RESNET (http://www.ariadnegenomics.com/), KEGG (Kanehisa, 2002), BIND (Alfarano et al., 2005), GO (Ashburner et al., 2000), DIP (Xenarios et al., 2000), ERGO (http://www.integratedgenomics.com/) and PathArt (http:// jubilantbiosys.com/). Importantly, this package also contains an SQL-like language that allows users to query the network using some simple topological contractions with node and link attributes. In comparison to other packages, this query language provides a much more flexible tool for quickly filtering nodes of

2652

interest from large networks. Pathway Studio is a commercial product although academic licenses are available. Cytoscape (Shannon et al., 2003) is a well-known network visualization tool supporting a core set of features including standard and customizable network display styles, ability to import a large variety of interaction files, and zoomable network views. Release 2.3 claims a high-performance rendering engine supporting networks with as many as 100 K nodes and edges. One of the most positive aspects of Cytoscape is the large user and developer base. In particular, since Cytoscape is a Java application whose source code is released under the Lesser General Public License (LGPL), it is straightforward for third-party developers to construct new plugins for the system. In fact, more than 40 plugins are currently available available for tasks including importing networks from various data formats, analyzing networks and generating networks from literature searches. Osprey (Breitkreutz et al., 2003) was one of the first tools specifically designed to visualize and analyze large networks. Consequently, all but one network layout in Osprey are elaborations of the circular layout (described subsequently) because they can be quickly computed. Other tools that specialize in large networks include Interviewer (Han et al., 2004) and ProViz (Iragne et al., 2005). Osprey was also one of the first tools to support functional comparisons between different networks. In particular, Osprey is able to superimpose one network additively on top of another in order to show similarities and differences. Osprey is a Java application and can be used free of charge. The PATIKA Project (Demir et al., 2002) provides a WWWbased visual editor, PATIKAweb, for accessing a central database containing pathway data from several sources including Reactome (http://www.reactome.org/). The project is built on top of an extensive ontology supporting representation of biological objects at different levels of detail, and graph types that facilitate visualizations of molecular complexes, pathways and black-box reactions. PATIKAweb is capable of producing high-quality visualizations using the Tom Sawyer Visualization (http://www.tomsawyer.com/) software. It also supports SQL-like queries on node and edge properties. It is implemented using Java Server Pages and is publicly available for non-profit use. VisANT (Hu et al., 2005) not only provides network drawing capabilities, including support for very large networks, but it is one of the first such packages to support creation, visualization and analysis of mixed networks, i.e. networks containing both directed and undirected links. The ability to use nodes to model more complex entities such as protein complexes or pathways allow for more informative visualizations. VisANT implements algorithms for analyzing node degrees, clusters, path lengths, network motifs and network randomizations. Like Cytoscape, VisANT is a Java application that can be extended using plugins and is freely available. ProViz (Iragne et al., 2005) leverages the power of the graph drawing package Tulip (David, 2001) for handling graphs containing millions of nodes and edges, while maintaining a guaranteed response time (i.e. ProViz will never make the user wait longer that predefined length of time). Tulip supports of a sophisticated plugin architecture allowing third-party

developers to extend the system. Many plugins are currently available and shipped with the system including plugins for importing/exporting various network file formats, obtaining many different two and three-dimensional network layouts, computing various network metrics like connectivity and eccentricity, and selecting subgraphs such as spanning subtrees and paths between nodes. ProViz adds to these features the ability to import and export PSI-MI (Hermjakob et al., 2004b) and IntAct (Hermjakob et al., 2004a) data formats, and interfaces for exploring the GO (Ashburner et al., 2000) and IntAct controlled vocabularies. There is functionality to define filters for large networks. Both ProViz and Tulip are implemented in C++ and can be installed in Windows, Linux or MacOSX. The source code is released under the GNU General Public License (GPL). BiologicalNetworks/PathSys (Baitaluk et al., 2006a) extends Cytoscape and includes much of the functionality of Pathway Studio. In fact, Pathway Studio users will recognize the dialog box used to create pathways from a set of interactions. BiologicalNetworks is a user-interface to PathSys (Baitaluk et al., 2006b), a graph-based system for creating a combined database of biological pathways, gene regulatory networks and protein interaction maps. It integrates over 14 curated and publicly available data sources including BIND (Alfarano et al., 2005), GO (Ashburner et al., 2000) and KEGG (Kanehisa, 2002) for eight representative organisms. PathSys supports SQL-like queries that can explore network properties such connectivity and node degree. BiologicalNetworks improves on previous tools by better integrating expression data with network visualization and analysis. In particular, after importing expression data, users can apply sorting, normalization and clustering algorithms on the data and then create various tables, heat maps and network views of the data. It is implemented using Java Server Pages and is publicly available on the WWW.

FEATURE SURVEY

The utility of any biological network visualization tool ultimately depends on the supported features. In this section, we consider some of the most important features including available network layout routines, supported graphical notation, integration of analysis into the visualization, variety of user input methods, integration of external biological data sources, integration of third-party software and finally availability (licensing restrictions and platform limitations).

3.1

Network layouts

Clearly, one of the most important aspects of any biological network visualization is its ability to automatically construct network drawings (or, layouts). Most tools automatically create static layouts of networks, using methods that roughly fall into one of the following categories: 3.1.1 Circular Nearly every tool produces circular layouts. In its simplest form, each node is placed on the circumference of a circle and links are drawn as straight-line segments between them. More complicated versions attempt to order the nodes to

2653

M.Suderman and M.Hallett

uncover network symmetries and other versions place nodes on multiple concentric circles. Osprey (Breitkreutz et al., 2003) implements a total of six different elaborations on the circular layout. The most complex, called `Spoked Dual Ring', creates circular layouts of highly connected parts of the network inside a circle and places the remaining vertices on the circle circumference. The purpose of this layout is to highlight the the highly connected parts of the network and show how they relate to the remainder of the network (e.g. see Fig. S1a­c in the Supplementary Material). 3.1.2 Hierarchical Directed edges are particularly important when visualizing regulatory networks. One approach to visualizing draws nodes on a series of horizontal lines so that edges are directed from nodes on lower horizontal lines to nodes on higher horizontal lines. This approach, invented by Sugiyama et al. (1981), is included in several systems including Pathway Studio (Nikitin et al., 2003), BioPath (Schreiber, 2002), ROSPath (Paek et al., 2004), CellDesigner (Kitano, 2003) and Virtual Cell (http://www.vcell.org/). ProViz (Iragne et al., 2005) also produces hierarchical drawings but uses a different algorithm (Messinger et al., 1991). An example from CellDesigner is shown in Figure S2b. 3.1.3 Force-directed The drawings are also known as spring embeddings (Eades, 1984; Frick et al., 1994; Fruchterman and Reingold, 1991; Kamada and Kawai, 1989) since edges are modeled as springs that pull linked nodes together, or push unlinked nodes apart, until the layout reaches a state of equillibrium (e.g. see Figure S1a). Force-directed algorithms attempt to place nodes so that all forces are in equillibrium. This approach is quite popular because the algorithms are simple to implement, produce relatively good drawings, and are easy tweak for specific applications. In fact, nearly every network visualization tool implements the version described by Frick, Sander and Wang (Frick et al., 1999). The main drawback of force-directed algorithms is that they can require a significant amount of time before converging to equilibrium. Fortunately, these algorithms are often easy to visually animate so the user can watch the network model incrementally approach equillibrium and perhaps terminate the algorithm when a good drawing it obtained. 3.1.4 Simulated annealing As the name suggests, simulated annealing methods model problem space as a set of states each with an associated energy so that low energy states correspond to potential solutions. Simulated annealing algorithms find solutions by traversing the space, moving from one network layout to another until it finds a layout with `sufficiently low energy'. GeneWays (Rzhetsky et al., 2004) generalizes one such algorithm by Davidson and Harel (Davidson and Harel, 1996) for obtaining 3-dimensional layouts. Grid Layout (Li and Kurata, 2005) uses a related method and shows how, for a yeast network, their method seems to spacially cluster functionally related nodes. The main drawback of simulated annealing algorithms is that they tend to be slow (even in comparison with force-directed methods). Consequently, there are practical limits on the size of networks to which they can be applied. All of the above mentioned layouts assume a graphical network model where interactions are between exactly two

interactors. Although these simple models have been shown to yield biological insight, they are incapable of modeling more complicated biological relationships that involve more than two interactors like protein complexes, relationships that depend on external factors like cell state, or regulatory circuits. For instance, although the `topology' of the cis-regulatory network describing the set of transcription factors relevant for a particular promoter can be well described, the regulatory circuit describing the activation of the target cannot. Unfortunately, extending current visualizations to handle this added complexity is not straight-forward. Consequently, successful visualization depends on exploiting domain-specific knowledge to reduce difficult general problems to something more manageable. There have been a few successful attempts in this direction: 3.1.5 Subcellular localization Both Pathway Studio (Nikitin et al., 2003) and Patika (Demir et al., 2002) are capable of using localization to influence network visualizations, if nodes are annotated with subcellular localizations. In particular, both systems partition the drawing space into regions corresponding to the subcellular localizations and then search for layouts where nodes are forcibly constrained to their respective locations. Both systems make use of modified force-directed algorithms to achieve this. Pathway Studio uses representative cartoons as backgrounds for each region in order to improve readability. Two other tools, Cell Illustrator (Nagasaki et al., 2003) and Cerebral (Barsky et al., 2007), support subcellular localization in drawings where nodes are restricted to positions on a grid. For an example, see Figure 1. 3.1.6 Composite nodes Pathway Studio (Nikitin et al., 2003), Patika (Demir et al., 2002) and VisANT (Hu et al., 2005) visualize composite nodes representing molecular complexes and pathways as single nodes that can be interactively expanded to show individual members or collapsed. Some improvement to this functionality is warranted. VisANT, e.g. expands composite nodes by creating a small window on top of the current network view and then draws the composite node members inside the window. Unfortunately, these windows cover nearby neighbors making it difficult to see how the composite node members relate to the greater network. When the user attempts to expand a node in Patika (e.g. see Fig. S4), there must be space for the node to be expanded in the drawing, otherwise Patika will not expand the node. 3.1.7 Hierarchical clusters Hierarchical clusters of the nodes or edges can be very useful for obtaining simplified visualizations of large, complex networks. Schwikowski et al. (2000) show three views of a yeast protein­protein interaction network: either display all nodes and edges without any graph drawing constraints, collapse nodes of the same function into composite nodes, or collapse proteins of the same subcellular localization into composite nodes. Similar to quotient graphs (e.g. Bourqui et al., 2006), an edge between two composite nodes in the last two views indicates the existence of a threshhold number of edges between composite node members. More general hierarchical clusters of proteins exist, including, e.g. the Structural Classification of Proteins (SCOP) (Murzin et al., 1995) and Gene Ontology (Ashburner et al., 2000).

Tools for visually exploring biological networks

The SCOP hierarchy contains several levels of protein domain similarity differentiated by increasing specificity: class, fold, superfamily, family, protein and species. Lappe et al. (2001) show that a large yeast protein-protein interaction network at the SCOP level of superfamily has a very simple drawing. Edge thickness between superfamilies indicates the number of links between proteins in each superfamily. A recent Cytoscape plugin, GenePro (Vlasblom et al., 2006), partially supports interactive exploration of hierarchical network clusters (e.g. see Fig. S5). Given a protein interaction network and a predefined clustering on its nodes, GenePro initially presents the user with the most abstract view and then allows the user to expand clusters in a new window to see cluster members. GenePro can also render nodes as pie charts showing the fractions of proteins sharing a common feature. 3.1.8 Time series Most tools do not attempt to visualize time series data. Those that do, e.g. BioTapestry (Longabaugh et al. 2005), simply highlight links and nodes that are active during a given time period but otherwise present a static picture. Unfortunately, this approach fails to take advantage of the reduced network size at each time point and the small number of changes from one time point to the next. 3.1.9 Neighbor expansion Rather than show the entire network in one display, many tools including VisANT (Hu et al., 2005), Osprey (Breitkreutz et al., 2003) and MINT Viewer (Zanzoni et al., 2002; Chatr-aryamontri et al., 2007) initially show a small subnetwork and then allow the user to click on a node in order to add all of its neighbors to the current view (e.g. see Fig. S3). Later, the user may click the node again to hide those neighbors. The best tools provide animations from one network view to another so that the user can easily maintain a mental mapping from the previous to the current view. 3.1.10 Three dimensions Currently, only a few tools including GeneWays (Rzhetsky et al., 2004) and ProViz (Iragne et al., 2005) offer three-dimensional visualizations, and these are all very rudimentary. Making use of higher dimensions is difficult because users are generally viewing the network on a two-dimensional screen. Consequently, dynamic navigation is a necessity and is often awkward without specialized equipment. In addition, graphical complexity increases because network entities must not only represent data but also simulate distance from the user. 3.1.11 Matrix representations Although networks are typically visualized using the so-called `ball-and-stick' representation, a complementary representation uses adjacency matrices and is often useful for uncovering topological patterns in, e.g. dense networks. In Bioinformatics, these are more commonly called clustergrams, heatmaps with dendrograms, or cluster maps. Here, each node corresponds to exactly one row and one column in the matrix and the intersection of a row and column is colored to represent the existence or strength of the link between the corresponding nodes. Drawing this matrix with different row and column orderings can uncover monochromatic patches indicating clusters of nodes with similar `behavior' (e.g. Fig. 1 of Collins et al., 2007). To create a matrix representation, researchers generally use one or more methods

for `optimally' ordering rows and columns provided by their preferred statistical software package. Unfortunately, generalpurpose orderings are rarely sufficient for specific biological applications so there has been some recent investigation of support for computing user-assisted orderings (e.g. Henry and Fekete, 2006).

3.2

Graphical notation

Until recently, most tools relied heavily on node/edge shape (e.g. to represent whether the node corresponds to a protein, gene or small molecule) and colors (e.g. gene expression, subcellular localization, molecular function) to visualize network properties. Unfortunately, the lack of standards describing typical biological objects results in the need for each visualization to come equipped with a legend describing symbols and colors. In some cases, the use of such node and edge attributes actually detracts from readability. This has motivated the development of informal standards that have evolved via imitation and the popularity of some tools. For example, elements of the Pathway Studio layout style has migrated into the BiologicalNetworks package. However, concern about a lack of formal standards has been increasing (Klipp et al., 2007), and there now exist several efforts towards a fully standardized graphics vocabulary (Cook et al., 2001; Kitano, 2003; Kohn, 1999, 2001; Kohn et al., 2006; Kurata et al., 2005; Pirson et al., 2000). Cook et al. (2001) outline a carefully reasoned approach that can describe complex biological systems unambiguously. The authors hope that such a standard would be amenable to various automations including simulation and resolution of queries like `Find models where a potassium channel blocker affects cell-cycle progression'. Unfortunately, according to Kohn et al. (2006), this proposal is too cumbersome for biologists to actually use so they propose their own molecular interaction map (MIM) notation for regulatory networks that deliberately permits some forms of ambiguity. For example, in the interest of visual compactness, MIM diagrams do not specify an order for steps in a reaction. Kohn et al. (2006) downplay concerns for automation claiming that the process of manually creating MIM diagrams is in itself and important tool for exposing gaps in our knowledge of biological processes. Others however (Kurata et al., 2003, 2005) have implemented a tool called CADLIVE that supports a slight modification of MIM. Kitano (2003) defines an alternative graphical notation called Systems Biology Graphical Notation (SBGN) that uses state-transition diagrams to model regulatory networks. In constrast to MIM diagrams, SBGN diagrams do enforce an event sequence and are consequently less compact because they may contain multiple nodes for a single molecule. In addition, they have implemented a tool called CellDesigner that generates SBGN diagrams (Funahashi et al., 2003) as well as created a website (http://sbgn.org/) in order to promote wider community use and development of SBGN. Figure S2 shows an example from CellDesigner.

3.3

Integration of analysis

There are currently few network tools designed for both the visualization of biological networks and the analysis of these

2655

networks. Consequently, users are forced to switch between tools, resulting in the need to continually import/export and reformat data. Clearly, a more optimal choice would be a network tool that supports both visualization and analysis, with a seamless integration between these two procedures. BiologicalNetworks is an early leader here allowing pathway visualizations from queries that combine gene expression data analysis with simple topological patterns. Several specialized tools exist for the integration of very specific types of visualization and data. Wilmascope (Dwyer et al., 2004) shows time series data using `2.5 dimensional layouts' (networks are stacked one on top of the other by time points in order to highlight changes in the network). MAVisto (Schreiber and Schwobbermeyer, 2005) searches for over-represented ¨ network motifs and highlights these in drawings of the network. GridLayout (Li and Kurata, 2005) highlights functionally related nodes by placing them in roughly the same regions of the drawing. A large number of tools (Dahlquist et al., 2002; Grosu et al., 2002; Karp et al., 2002; Khatri et al., 2005; Mlecnik et al., 2005; Pan et al., 2003, Thimm et al., 2004) are designed mainly for mapping gene or protein expression profiles onto existing network diagrams.
