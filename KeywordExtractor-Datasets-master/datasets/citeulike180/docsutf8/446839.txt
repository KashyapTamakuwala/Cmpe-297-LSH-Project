What does the photoblog want?
Kris R. Cohen
INCITE, UNIVERSITY OF SURREY, UK PHD STUDENT, UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO, USA

What does the photoblog want? This is a provocation and a puzzle: while social and technical possibilities for photography multiply wildly, there has been a seizure in the critical writing which addresses photography. There are analogue cameras and digital cameras, phones with cameras, cult cameras (Lomo, L'espion), there are websites and chat groups for photography, there is software for the manipulation of photography, printers for digital cameras, services that will print uploaded digital photographs on photo-quality paper, there are websites to which you can send your digital photos directly from your phone ­ and this is only a small list, a sense of the possibilities. In the writing about photography, however, what you often get are versions of a debate which never fails, somehow, to centre on the status of the Real in relation to photography, although the value-encoded terms used to articulate this debate can differ: reality or confection, evidence or artistry, document or statement. But despite these consistencies in the literature, a photograph's uncertain connection to the real life in which it is made renders it a paradox at the level of being (what it is), and equivocal at the level of its expressive content (what it means, or knows). What do we see when we look at a photograph? And what does this have to do with what we feel about them? These questions have been often asked. While there is no apparent agreement about the extent that the Real inhabits the photograph, or to what counteracting degree subjectivity asserts itself, there does seem to be almost unanimous (though unacknowledged) agreement subtending these debates that the Real is the real issue. I think Sarah Kember (2003: 203) is

probably right to locate the persistence of this debate in desire:1 right to locate the apparent lack of agreement in a desire not to agree, and the subterranean agreement in a desire not to be caught agreeing (or an illicit desire to be in agreement). Roland Barthes (1980) famously writes desire into the theory of photography and into his attempts to reckon with some of photography's effects. He calls the resultant method a `cynical phenomenology'. So the question can be nicely re-cast: not `What do photographs represent?', but `What do we want to see when we look at them?' And now photography is digital ­ re-invented as one of the `new' media ­ and we wonder what this means. The question has sparked discussion, but there is something oblique in the conversations about digital photography.2 It is possible to talk about why this might be the case. If it is not clear how the digital intervenes in the representational space of photographs ­ and it is not ­ then it cannot be clear how theory should address the digital. There is, therefore, a recidivism in the literature on digital photography (Kember, 2003: 213). With new digital processes, it seems, we return to old theoretical haunts, and so we again find ourselves asking: `What has become of the Real?' Previously, theory had achieved an uneasy d´ tente with regard to the (territorial) status of the Real in photography; not e a resolution of the debates so much as an abatement ­ perhaps a stalemate, perhaps an indifference. Now, with regard to Photoshop and its influences, the factual content of photographs is again taken to be under threat (always this siege mentality), and the question of the Real has been passionately revived. Thus, the Real persists. This is no longer a surprise. Theories of photography are commonly drawn from, and subsequently re-cast as questions of representation, and specifically, of representation's reach. Questions like: what does the photographic image represent? And specifically, how deeply (back) into Reality do these representations establish roots: to the appearance of the thing, to our mental image of it, to the thing itself, to some aspect of its unique being? As a result of this tendency to tether photography to questions of representation, the trajectory of photographic theory always arcs ­ and arcs quickly, as if eager to get where it's going and anxious to leave where it's been ­ from the act of taking the photograph to the photograph itself, straight from photography to photograph. The habits that inform the questions asked of photography ensure that this path is run perpetually, that whatever the subject and whatever the interests being served, the analytics deployed to address photography are routed in the familiar way. Thus photography itself ­ as the artefact of its various analyses (which is not the only thing that it is) ­ is made familiar. The question of the presence and role of the Real ­ the usual question of representation ­ packs an interesting assumption: that reality always extends itself, with varying degrees of fidelity and persistence, through the following chain of photographic events, in this order: (1) the choice of

subject (what is to be pictured); (2) capturing an image of the subject (the authority of the button); and (3) viewing the subject as an image (the presumed effect of these processes). One effect of the Real, then, whatever one's stance towards it, is to drive these photographic events forward, towards the photograph as the meaningful object and endpoint of analysis, as if this was where they were destined all along. The question of the Real is not just one to be addressed through an analytics; it is, itself, an analytic perspective, one that sees photography (the act) as having a causal relationship to photographs. From an ethnographic perspective ­ one I employ in the following ­ in which meaningful activity clusters around all points in a constellation of photographic practices,3 the tendentiousness of this link, from photography to photograph, stands out as odd, as itself analytical and, moreover, as one analytical choice among many. The picture of photography looks perhaps more like a constellation than a vector; and the Real (merely) travels in this constellation. The photographic practices of a particular group of new media users, photobloggers, both suggest and illustrate the point. Photobloggers are people who make photographs and post them on the web in the form of photoblogs or photographic journals. They are at the centre of this article, and a look at their practices will exemplify some problems that exist in the analysis of photographs and new media objects generally.

Photoblogging There are now well over a million documented blogs and photoblogs in the world, with most appearing in the last 12 months.4 Their newfound popularity has provoked a gentle storm of press, along with a significant number of utopic scenarios in which blogs feature as the next emancipatory mass media product.5 The word `blog' is a contraction, of `web' and `log'. Say it fast, elide the gap between the b and the l: `web-log:' Blog. Verb: to blog or blogging. Noun: my blog. Someone who blogs is a blogger.
Weblogs first emerged on the Internet in any number in 1999. Their initial use, as a page from which to list and update favourite website addresses, encouraged a links-based commentary, which then quickly developed into a form of online journal or public diary (posts are organised chronologically). Worldwide, there are now over half a million weblogs [at the time of writing, there are more than twice this amount], the majority of them written by individuals in the United States. Although other forms of weblogging have since emerged (devoted to political punditry, news commentary, fan culture, business promotion and management etc.), the journal blog remains by far the dominant form. (Reed, 2003: n.p.)6

Journal blogs are web logs in which the author chronicles events in his or her daily life. Daily updates are the norm; some people post to their blog

far more frequently. Variety in the content of blogs is nearly infinite, but common topics are: problems at work, unusual occurrences, parties, heartbreak, the beginnings and ends of relationships, favourite bands, trips to unfamiliar places, etc. The things that turn us on. There are varying degrees of intimacy and anonymity in blogs. While most bloggers welcome feedback about their blog (and their life), some are more cautious about the personal information they give out. Most bloggers have a story or two about someone reading something they weren't supposed to read. These are the dangers of keeping a journal of any kind, but especially one that exists online. But most bloggers don't consider blogging to be a dangerous, risky, or compromising practice. There are blogs and now photoblogs, which are related in many ways, but are not the same. Roughly analogized: text is to blogging as photographs are to photoblogging. It is also true that many blogs contain photographs and photoblogs almost always contain some text. So the distinction between them is not a clear one. A theme here will be the way that these practices ­ blogging, photoblogging ­ outrun most attempts to fix them in analysis, in writing. But in a simplified account: blogs use short bits of writing to chronicle daily events while photoblogs tend to use photographs in association with text to tell their tales.7 Photobloggers themselves are never sanctimonious in the way they define photoblogging; for the most part they leave the definition to the individual blogger. One website defines photoblogs this way:
A photoblog is a type of blog that is regularly updated with photos. Some photoblogs focus only on photography, while others have photos in addition to other content. All photoblogs, however, consider photos to be an important part of their chronological blogging structure. (www.photoblogs.org/faq/)

As my interests are in the uses of photography as new media, I will be almost exclusively concerned with photoblogs, although there will be places where it will be obvious that blogs and photoblogs need to be, almost can't help but be, treated together. I will therefore sometimes speak of them interchangeably. This isn't to suggest that the differences between them are not significant; it is an index of the cultural proximity between the two forms, the fact that they share production technologies, space on the internet, some genealogical traces, media attention, audiences and often authors/bloggers. I think, for these reasons, it would be misleading to entirely ignore one in the study of the other, just as it would be misleading to entirely ignore the differences between them. In my research, I have spoken to 30 people who put their own photographs online in the form of a journal or blog.8 Most of these identify as "photobloggers" (by that name) but all of them behave, with respect to the websites they maintain and for the purposes of my broad definition, like photobloggers.9 Before each conversation, I spent a long time viewing the

photoblogs. These conversations covered: the interviewees' interests in photography generally; their collections of photographs and what they do with them; why and how they first started photoblogging; the technologies they use to take pictures and create their blog; changes that have occurred in their photographic or photoblogging practices since starting the blog; their relationship to the wider world of photobloggers; the kinds of photography they care about; and the situations in which they tend to make photos. Variables in the photoblogging form include: presence or absence of captions for the photos; presence or absence of categories into which the images are organized; relative conventionality of photographic categories (`my trip to Spain' versus `how to make beans on toast'); quantity of photographs; degree of integration of photographs with text; size and/or quality of images (related to a site's load time, but also to the quality of one's camera); and degree of protection the photoblogger tries to secure for her/his images (`use anything you want' versus `please ask me before using one of my photographs'). The picture of photoblogging gets more interesting when we include the doing of photoblogging; and not just doing as the means to an end ­ as the process that produces the photoblog and then disappears ­ but doing as a product and site of meaningful activity in its own right. Photoblogging and the photoblog both incorporate actions; they also both incorporate some effects of those actions. Each acts as noun and verb and the lines that connect the two are neither straight nor unidirectional. In talking to photobloggers, a couple of common and important ways of doing the photoblog quickly emerge. First, photobloggers tend to take a lot of photographs; most say that they take more photographs than they ever have, and that the photoblog is not only a repository for these images, but a tactic for achieving just this proliferation. So, they like to have photographs, but also, and crucially, the photographic act ­ looking for photographs, composing, taking, reviewing, showing ­ becomes newly enjoyable and newly heterogeneous in the broad context of doing a photoblog. Photobloggers like, most of all, to make photographs of what they call `the everyday', the `banal' or the `mundane'. These descriptors are a way of emphasizing what their photographs are not about: they are not your conventional holiday or Big Occasion snaps, not just about weddings and birthdays. They're not that kind of mundane. Instead, most photobloggers say that `real life' is the desired content of their photographs. They want pictures of life as it happens, as they experience it. `Real life', photobloggers say, traditionally happens outside of photographs, and this is precisely what they want in their photos. `Real life', as it is used here, reaches out for at least one more concept: the digital. It is digital photography that facilitates photobloggers' access to `real

life'. The fact that digital photographs are free (once the camera and accessories have been purchased) allows photobloggers to take more photos, to experiment and play in a way they rarely did when paying for film processing. What they tend to do under these expanded conditions ­ and I think this is an interesting and non-obvious choice ­ is take more photos of what they call `real life': life as it happens, the small stuff, an intriguing signpost, the stages of construction of a new building, the Thames at low tide, a strange effect of lighting. This behaviour appears to invert a strong claim often made about the digital and its supposed virtuality: namely the claim that the digital introduces a disconcerting fissure of virtuality and indeterminacy into the Real and into our realities. If a photograph is digital, the story goes, how can we tell if it's been altered, if irrealities have tainted the photograph's realities? With photoblogging practices, conversely, the digital prepares the field for the introduction of the Real, for the introduction of `real life' into photography.10 There are related aesthetic considerations: by and large, photobloggers don't like flash photography. They actively eschew it, in fact, preferring blurs and indecipherability to the disfiguring glare of a flash bulb. They also don't like posed photographs, unless the pose is self-consciously struck and thus internally critical (via irony, caricature or mockery) of posing, as such. Because they don't tend to like poses, many invent shooting tactics which disarm people's hair-trigger proclivity to compose themselves for a camera: they `shoot from the hip', they shoot over their shoulder, they shoot when friends' mouths are full, when no one is expecting, they shoot surreptitiously on the train or anywhere. Photobloggers explain their various disinclinations by saying they'd rather have pictures of people as they `really are'. People don't smile abstractly or pose artificially or glow strobically in `real life', so why would they want a photograph of such effects? Photobloggers question what a photograph of someone self-composed and smiling (aware of themselves as a photographic image) is actually a photograph of. Specifically, the complaint here is lodged in the small space between the means of representation and what is represented. In their discussions of pose and flash in photography, photobloggers are thinking about the `real-life' moment when the photo is made and the way this moment inhabits the resulting image. They are thinking quite specifically about the mise-en-sc` ne of photography and how this gets traced within a e photograph. Unexpectedly, much of the photobloggers' work, pleasure and desire is here ­ not solely online, not solely in the photographs themselves, but in the activities that occur at the moment of photography, in the way the doing of the photoblog conjures these activities, and the reciprocal way that the doing of photography conjures the photoblog. As we'll see more clearly, their work effects a drawing together: of the desires that differently motivate using a camera and constructing a blog, and of the technologies involved in all parts of the process. In order to see this, it is important that

photography and the photoblog, the making of photographs and the photographs themselves, the camera and the computer, not be connected via the usual mechanisms: causality, consecutive temporality or straight intention, although the tendency will be to do exactly that. Photobloggers manage their blog at home, at work or wherever they have access to a computer and the fastest internet connection. For most photobloggers, this happens anywhere from a few hours to a few days after they've taken the photos, although the general wish is for this time to shrink (to be more organized, to make more time for their blog, to spend less time at work, etc.). When looking back at their photos, photobloggers describe two different kinds of experience. In one, the image evokes some facet of the picture-taking moment: what the shot looked like in their mind's eye; the feeling of being just there, just then; their motivation for taking the photo, etc. In the other, the image provokes a new kind of response, a new experience (distinct from anything that happened when the image was taken). There is a desired surprise that many photobloggers talk about which happens when they look at their photographs after having made them, and which they therefore associate closely with the making of the blog. They say, as a way of explaining the occurrence and appeal of this desired surprise, that they do not have strict intentions for their photography. The fact that digital photographs are free of cost allows them to take pictures whenever they want, of whatever they want. They can relax their standards; they can shoot outside traditional photographic categories. And this proliferation of photographs and the situations in which photographs are made creates the conditions under which surprise is possible. The first kind of experience (memory) is motivated by photography; the second (surprise) by the photograph. Although, interestingly, both kinds of experience stab backwards, from the viewing of a photograph to the act of photography, collapsing not the time or distance that separates these activities, but the activities themselves. Photobloggers often write captions for their photographs as a way, they say, of letting their audience know what they had in mind when they took the photo. Captions also simply describe what the photograph depicts, if this is not obvious. One photoblogger adds that she likes to write captions `because you've got a person's comment there. It's not just a photo that exists on its own. It gives it some context, some human context. Rather than just being on its own. This has been selected by a person.' Most photobloggers say something curious about how they select the photos that will appear on their blog (because no one I talked to posts all of their photographs; there is always a process of selection). They say: `I don't know if a photograph will be good until I've taken it.' Their reply is about standards of evaluation, and, more precisely, about the importance of spontaneity in the process of selection and the doing of a photoblog generally.

Their interest in picturing `the mundane' ­ the simple everyday moments of their lives, the otherwise unremarkable events ­ has led every photoblogger I know to carry their camera with them at all times, or to aspire to this. One photoblogger always carries his digital camera in a holster on his belt. Others carry cameras in their rucksacks and handbags. They hate to forget their camera ­ and despite due diligence, they're always forgetting their cameras. And of course, something is bound to want photographing whenever the camera isn't there. One photoblogger described to me an especially pleasing alignment of buildings seen at a very early hour of the morning, but which he had missed (in more than just a photographic sense, I think) because he had forgotten his camera. He would be obliged someday, he told me, to go back to that spot, and stay up until just that hour, possibly imbibing the same amount of alcohol, in order to recreate and capture that image he first saw. In his story, and his description of how the image will have to be re-staged, we begin to see the incorporative tendencies at work here: photoblog, photoblogger, photography; that particular hour, a particular state of mind, the look of the city. No element in the preceding lists leaves off neatly before another. They shuffle and entwine. So that the resulting photograph is both a thing and an experience; it exists alone, but also as an integrated part of one's experiences of a day, or night. In the same way that one dreads missing a good experience, most photobloggers dread leaving their camera behind. In talking with me, photobloggers tend to return the discussion of photoblogs to everyday experiences, as if in some sense this is really what we have been talking about, and not photography or photoblogging at all. When asked too many questions about the nature of their photography, about what they like and why they do what they do, many retreat into selfcritique, or self-parody: `My photos are often of really boring stuff, just what I see.' These responses appear to be entirely ingenuous (not falsely self-deprecating) in at least one sense: they are an honest reaction to being forced by the interviewer to think too much and in the wrong way about their own practices. This kind of response emphasizes the importance to photoblogging of not thinking too much, of the role that instinct plays in the making of photographs and the photoblog. In interviews with photobloggers, I often found myself pressing them up against the end of their desire or ability to profitably talk about what they do. This presents an interesting problem for my research, and an interesting opportunity at the level of analysis. There are two broad themes that I now want to discuss, both related to desire: the first, a desire that reaches outward in order to draw in (`Collapse'); the second, a desire that draws inward in order to extend out (`Motivate'). The goal that each section shares is to demonstrate how the practice of photoblogging (for instance) resists what has been our common tendency to separate technology (e.g. the camera) and its apparent products

(e.g. the photograph), as if the former were merely a tool and the latter were the real thing, the analytical object, the source of the human.11

Collapse This excerpt from a conversation I had with one photoblogger, who I'll call Ed, raises some key characteristics of photoblogs, the act of photoblogging, and the theme of collapse.
K: You need a camera implanted in your eyes. E: That's what I want: camera on the glasses, mobile phone around ear, bluetooth to a pack down here and computer [on waist], and heads-up display on glasses. So, completely wired but with none of these objects [gesturing at his L'espion digital camera, mobile phone, Handspring PDA plus portable keyboard, and mp3 player]. So I can go around recording, taking pictures by [pause] blinking, I don't know.

My suggestion that Ed implant cameras in his eyes is a joke that worked in the context of the interview ­ that is, in the interview, it wasn't quite the exaggeration or non sequitur that it seems to be here. It was my response to a desire I heard voiced in Ed's descriptions of his own photographic practice. Ed, like most photobloggers, endeavours to always take more photographs (than he did before; than he does now), and many of his purchases of new technology, as well as his new or reconceived uses for technology, are strategies for achieving this goal. For instance, he says he bought a L'espion camera because it was an affordable digital camera (£30), but its small size and tiny pleather holster allowed Ed to always carry a camera with him. He experienced these affordances of the camera as a solution: specifically, to the problem of never having a camera when he needed one; to the problem of not taking enough photos. He also takes walks around London to increase his chances of encountering photographs (to place himself in the way of potential photographs). He seemed intensely interested not just in the photography or the photographs themselves, but in the frequency with which he manages to take photographs, as if the proliferation of occasions and sites for photography was as much the goal as photography itself. So, in the interview, my joke about Ed needing bionic eyes seemed to follow appropriately from the themes of the conversation. But Ed further normalized my comment by fully, unconditionally, unhesitatingly accepting it not only as a sensible suggestion, but also as a solution that he had already devised. While his imagined system is both technologically practicable and genuinely something that he'd like to have, it is articulated as a fantasy, and therefore can be read as a description of an obstacle and its removal. `So I can go around recording, taking pictures by [pause]

blinking, I don't know.' Blinking, as a trigger, would significantly reduce the barriers that exist between seeing the image and fixing it photographically ­ barriers which, with a digital camera, include: retrieving the camera, turning it on, waiting for the camera to ready itself, lining up the shot, pressing the button, and then waiting for the camera to focus, process, and record. Earlier in the interview, Ed described walking through Westminster and seeing a bus with an interesting advertisement on its side, one that he wanted to photograph. The event was remarkable because the difficulty of removing the camera from his bag caused Ed to miss the shot. Blinking, as a trigger, would collapse the instant of first sight with photography itself, with the act of making the picture. If, in our reading of this scene and the movements of bodies, technologies and practices therein, we privilege only the final image, then Ed's fantasy seems to have solved the problem of not having enough or the right kind of photographs. But this is not quite his problem. What Ed's fantasized blogging machine accomplishes is the collapse of certain barriers that separate existence ­ the living of life ­ from the making of photographs. Ed wants to live as he photographs; to photograph as he lives. Photography would become less independent of the act of going for a walk; the walk itself less resistant to the making of photographs. If we arrest the expected analytical movement from photography to photograph, what becomes visible is the new, categorical richness of the photographic moment ­ which, in Ed's fantasy, becomes inextricable from the richness of his life. His problem is the barrier that exists between the living of his life and the technologies for making photographs within and throughout that life. In a sense, he sees technology as his problem (i.e. its discreteness from life, from his body and from the biological ways his sight functions). Interestingly, his solution is a technological one: augment his body with the means to generate photographs as he lives; remove duration from the process of taking a photograph; remove the need to reach out and grasp a separate physical device in order to fix the image. Notice not just how Ed's desires begin to articulate an interestingly reconfigured photography, but how his technological fantasy is also a fantasy about his life. He wants to proliferate photography so that it becomes less distinct from his life in general. An infinite expansion of photography in this way would effect an infinite regression as well: being everywhere, photography would also be nowhere. But the collapse Ed effects in his technological fantasy is more farreaching still. What his blogging machine draws into the photographic moment is not just the final image but a unique medium for the publication and display of the image: the photoblog. Ed needs Bluetooth, a mobile phone and a computer pack because what he also wants to do is instantly blog the photos he captures ­ that is, instantly send them to the web and his own website, his blog.

I've spent so much time on this single fantasy because it is one that I think other photobloggers would understand, and one that tips us off to a significant theme in photoblogging. What Ed, and other phot
