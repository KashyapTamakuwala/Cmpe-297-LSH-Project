The anterior cingulate and orbital cortices and the ventral striatum process different aspects of reward evaluation, whereas the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the dorsal striatum are involved in cognitive function. Collectively, these areas are critical to decision making. We mapped the striatal area that receives information about reward evaluation. We also explored the extent to which terminals from reward-related cortical areas converge in the striatum with those from cognitive regions. Using three-dimensional-rendered reconstructions of corticostriatal projection fields along with two-dimensional chartings, we demonstrate the reward and cognitive territories in the primate striatum and show the convergence between these cortical inputs. The results show two labeling patterns: a focal projection field that consists of densely distributed terminal patches, and a diffuse projection consisting of clusters of fibers, extending throughout a wide area of the striatum. Together, these projection fields demonstrate a remarkably large, rostral, reward-related striatal territory that reaches into the dorsal striatum. Fibers from different reward-processing and cognitive cortical areas occupy both separate and converging territories. Furthermore, the diffuse projection may serve a separate integrative function by broadly disseminating general cortical activity. These findings show that the rostral striatum is in a unique position to mediate different aspects of incentive learning. Furthermore, areas of convergence may be particularly sensitive to dopamine modulation during decision making and habit formation.

Introduction
A key component to good decision making is the ability to accurately evaluate elements of outcome, including reward value, predictability, and risk. Different prefrontal cortical areas and corresponding striatal regions are involved in various aspects of reward evaluation and incentive-based learning (Elliott et al., 2000b, 2003; Schultz et al., 2000; Knutson et al., 2001; Pagnoni et al., 2002) and are associated with pathological risk taking and addictive behaviors (Kuhnen and Knutson, 2005; Volkow et al., 2005). The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and orbital cortex (OFC) mediate the different aspects of reward-based behaviors, error prediction, and the choice between short- and long-term gains. The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is engaged when working memory is required for monitoring behavior (Goldman-Rakic et al., 1990; Elliott et al., 2000a; Hadland et al., 2003; Walton et al., 2004; Fellows and Farah, 2005).

OFC and DLPFC are connected to the nucleus accumbens (or ventral striatum) and the caudate nucleus, respectively (Yeterian and Van Hoesen, 1978; Selemon and Goldman-Rakic, 1985; Haber et al., 1995; Ferry et al., 2000). However, these connectivity studies have emphasized a directed topography of connections, supporting a model of segregated and parallel corticobasal ganglia circuits (Alexander et al., 1990). Nonetheless, rewardresponsive activation is not restricted to the ventral striatum but is found throughout the striatum (Hassani et al., 2001; Takikawa et al., 2002; Tanaka et al., 2004). Because the reward signal, critical to the striatal role in learning, is generated from the midbrain dopamine cells (Schultz, 2002) and conveyed to each of the separate and parallel cortical pathways within the striatum, little attention has been given to a possible role for the direct ACC/ OFC striatal inputs for incentive learning outside of the relatively restricted ventral striatal region. Our experiments were designed to (1) determine the extent of the reward-related striatum based on ACC/OFC cortical inputs and (2) determine whether there is convergence between these inputs and with those from the DLPFC. Such convergence would influence reward-based learning and may be particularly sensitive to the dopamine signal (Haber et al., 2000; Everitt and Robbins, 2005). Recent human imaging studies have divided the prefrontal

typically the result of the injection site centered in superficial cortical layers. All thin, labeled fibers containing boutons were charted. Thick fibers without clear terminal boutons were assumed to be passing fibers and were not included. Fiber distributions for each case were charted throughout the rostrocaudal striatum. We divided the ACC/OFC into the following: the dACC, areas 24b and dorsal 32; the vmPFC, areas 25 and 14m; and the OFC, areas 11, 13, and 12. There were four injections into different regions of the dACC, six into the vmPFC, nine into different regions of OFC, and seven into the DLPFC (Fig. 1). Four animals received multiple injections into different regions of the prefrontal cortex. The general corticocortical labeling in each case was consistent with expected results from on target injections (Barbas and Pandya, 1989; Carmichael and Price, 1996). For the anatomical boundaries of ACC, OFC, and DLPFC, we used the atlas by Paxinos et al. (2000) in conjunction with detailed anatomical descriptions (Barbas and Pandya, 1989). 3-D reconstructions. 3-D reconstructions of focal projection fields in the striatum were developed to (1) address how each focal projection lies within the striatum in dorsal/ventromedial/lateroanterior/posterior space, and (2) develop a 3-D global model to compare multiple focal projections from different cortical regions. Previous studies have shown (at low magnification) relatively large, dense patches of corticostriatal projections (Yeterian and Van Hoesen, 1978; Selemon and GoldmanRakic, 1985; Parthasarathy et al., 1992). We used the ability to visualize these dense projections at low magnification to create the 3-D renderings for the focal projections. These areas were determined using a 1.6 objective and the Neurolucida software (MicroBrightfield, Colchester, VT) to directly outline the region. Adjacent patches of dense fibers visible at 1.6 that were clearly surrounded by a less dense area, but visualized at 4 , were connected and considered as one object. Isolated patches were treated as individual objects. Boundaries for each focal projection were checked for accuracy with the chartings that were performed at higher magnification (10 ) (see Fig. 2e). For each case, a stack of 2-D coronal sections was created from its Neurolucida chartings and Nissl images. This stack was imported into IMOD, a 3-D rendering program (Boulder Laboratory for 3D Electron Microscopy of Cells, University of Colorado, Boulder, CO) (Kremer et al., 1996), and a 3-D reconstruction that contained the focal projection field was created for each case separately. To merge several cases together, we developed a reference model of the striatum from one animal. This model was created by sampling one in eight sections (at 400 m intervals) throughout the striatum, using alternate sections stained with acetylcholinesterase, Nissl, and enkephalin immunoreactivity. Data from each case was then transposed into the reference striatum using landmarks of key internal structures surrounding the striatum. After the transposition of focal projections from each case, every contour placed in the reference model was checked with the original for medial/lateral, dorsal/ventral, and anterior/posterior placement and relative size. This ensured that the focal projection field from each case was accurately placed with respect to its position and the proportion of the striatum it occupied. Thus, a 3-D rendering was created first for each single case and then for the combinations of cases. To determine convergence between focal projection fields, the model was "sectioned" throughout its rostrocaudal extent (see Fig. 3). Final verification of convergence was demonstrated with dual injections into a single animal (see Fig. 4). Using MRI data obtained for eight monkeys (four M. nemestrina and four M. fascicularis), we calculated the volume of the striatum. We found that the volume within each species was relatively similar, but, consistent with a smaller overall brain, the striatum in the M. fascicularis is somewhat smaller compared with the M. nemestrina (M. nemestrina, 1285 42 mm 3; M. fascicularis, 943 41 mm 3; mean SE).

Results
General terminal distribution Figure 2 illustrates the complete projection from a representative tracer injection into the different prefrontal regions. There were two labeling patterns in the striatum, a focal projection field and a diffuse one (Fig. 2). The focal projection field consisted of dense clusters of terminals forming the well known dense patches. These could be visualized with relatively low magnification

widely distributed throughout the striatum, both expanding the borders of the focal terminal fields and also extending widely throughout other regions of the striatum. The focal projection fields The focal projection field from the vmPFC was the most limited and was concentrated at the level of the nucleus accumbens, within and dorsal to the shell (Fig. 2a). These injections resulted in corticocortical labeling in other medial subgenual regions and in areas 24a and 12, with few or no fibers terminating in areas 24b and 24c or in areas 9 and 46. Projections from the dACC extended from the rostral pole of the caudate nucleus to the anterior commissure and were primarily located dorsal to the nucleus accumbens in both the central caudate nucleus and putamen but were not adjacent to the ventricle (Fig. 2b). They primarily avoided the shell region, although there was one dense terminal patch within the shell. Injections into different rostrocaudal regions of the dACC resulted in dense corticocortical labeling in area 9 and throughout area 24c (motor cingulate cortex). The OFC also projected to both the caudate nucleus and putamen but terminated somewhat medial and caudal to those from the dACC (Fig. 2c). Projections terminated primarily in a strip along the centromedial caudate nucleus extending ventral and lateral into the putamen (Fig. 2b). Despite the extensive overlap between the projection fields from each OFC injection site, there were some small topographic shifts depending on the medial/lateral position of the injection within the OFC. Injections placed into the OFC resulted in cortical labeling that was primarily located in other orbital regions, lateral to the gyrus rectus and in areas 9 and 46. Projections from the DLPFC were found from the beginning of the rostral pole and continued for 14.5 mm, through much of the body of the caudate nucleus and medial putamen (Fig. 2d).

of those projections. Case 124 (Fig. 4a,b) had an injection into dACC (area 24b) and one into OFC (area 13). Case 133 (Fig. 4e,f ) had an injection into dACC (area 32) and OFC (area 11). In both cases, portions of the focal projections converged in the central and medial rostral striatum. Case 115 (Fig. 4c,d) had an injection into the vmPFC and one into the OFC (area 13). Focal projections fields from these two injection sites converged rostral to the nucleus accumbens. Figure 4, a, c, and e, shows the outline of the focal projection (from areas 24b, vmPFC, and 32, respectively) superimposed on its dense terminal field. Figure 4, b, d, and f, shows that outline placed on the adjacent section that was processed for the second tracer placed in respective areas 13, 13, and 11. Distribution of diffuse terminal fields Each injection produced many labeled fibers that extended outside of the focal terminal fields that were used for the 3-D reconstructions (Fig. 2). We compiled these charted fibers from each case into one map to illustrate the extent of the diffuse projection areas from the vmPFC, OFC, dACC, and DLPFC (Fig. 5). Fiber clusters surrounded and increased the area of the focal projections. In addition, they extended some distances from them, invading striatal regions that receive their focal input from other prefrontal cortex areas. To demonstrate the convergence between the diffuse terminals fields and focal projections from different cortical regions, we also illustrate the collective chartings superimposed onto the focal projection field maps (Fig. 5g­j). The focal projection from vmPFC was relatively confined to the nucleus accumbens and medial caudate nucleus. Clusters of terminals were also located in more dorsal and lateral striatal regions (Fig. 5a,b) (see also Fig. 2a), within the distal focal projections fields from the OFC, and dACC, and the diffuse projections from the DLPFC (Fig. 5c­f ). However, it is of particular interest that the diffuse projections from the vmPFC remained limited to the immediate area surrounding its focal projection, thus confining both the diffuse and focal projections from the vmPFC projections to a relatively small and limited ventromedial striatal position. The diffuse projections from dACC extended its projection field in all directions (Fig. 5a,b) (see also Fig. 2b), overlapping with the focal projections from the vmPFC, OFC, and DLPFC (Fig. 5g­i). Unlike terminals from the vmPFC, clusters of fibers were found in the dorsal lateral caudate nucleus and in the caudal ventral putamen, areas that did not receive a focal input from other prefrontal regions studied (Fig. 5b,c). They were also scattered in the medial half of the putamen, caudal to the anterior commissure, an area that also contains few fibers from other prefrontal regions (Fig. 5i,j). Together, fibers from the dACC invaded almost the entire rostral striatum, with extensive convergence with projections from both the OFC and the DLPFC (Fig. 5d­j.). The diffuse projection from the OFC expanded its focal projection into the rostral pole (Fig. 5a) (see also Fig. 2c) and into the dorsal and central caudate and putamen. Like the dACC, the OFC innervated a large portion of the rostral striatum with extensive convergence with the focal and diffuse projections from both the dACC and the DLPFC (Fig. 5c­ h). However, at more caudal levels, there were few OFC fibers in the dorsolateral region. Here the diffuse projection was concentrated in the dorsal caudate and ventral putamen (Fig. 5f,i,j). Clusters of DLPFC fibers terminated throughout the rostral striatum, including the ventral striatum and lateral putamen (Fig. 5d­f ) (see also Fig. 2d). The combination of focal and diffuse projections demonstrates that the DLPFC occupied much of the

tions (Fig. 3a). The focal projections from the dACC and OFC regions did not occupy completely separate territories in any part of the striatum (Fig. 3b­j) but converged most extensively at rostral levels. In contrast, there was greater separation of projections between terminals from the vmPFC and the dACC/OFC, particularly at caudal levels (Fig. 3i,j). Unlike the concentration of terminal fields of the vmPFC, dACC, and OFC located anterior to the anterior commissure, those from the DLPFC occupied a longitudinal dorsal and central strip from the rostral pole of the striatum, extending caudally. Patches of dense DLPFC terminal fields were also located in the putamen adjacent to the internal capsule. At rostral levels, DLPFC terminals converged with those from both the dACC and OFC (Fig. 3e­j), although each cortical projection also occupied its own territory. Here, projections from all PFC areas occupied a central region, with each cortical projection extending into nonoverlapping zones. Convergence was less prominent caudally, with almost complete separation of the dense terminals from the DLPFC and dACC/OFC just rostral to the anterior commissure (Fig. 3j). Several individual cases that had two or more tracer injections in different cortical regions (Fig. 4) illustrate the convergence between focal projection fields and interdigitation at the borders

occupies at least 22% of the striatum. Furthermore, the reward-related striatum is not limited to the ventral striatum but extends into a large medial and central region of the dorsal striatum and occupies much of the rostral pole before tapering off caudally. The large extent of this region is consistent with the findings that diverse striatal areas are activated after rewardrelated behavioral paradigms (Takikawa et al., 2002; Corlett et al., 2004; Haruno et al., 2004; Kawagoe et al., 2004; Tanaka et al., 2004; Tricomi et al., 2004; Kuhnen and Knutson, 2005). There are regions of convergence between the focal terminal fields that provide an anatomical substrate for integration between different rewardprocessing circuits within specific striatal areas. Because medium spiny neurons have a dendritic field spanning up to 0.5 mm in all directions (Wilson, 2004), the area of convergence is likely to be larger than estimated based solely on the relationship between the afferent projections alone. Areas of converging terminals may represent "hot spots" of plasticity for integrating reward value, predictability, and salience and may be especially vulnerable to the development of addictive disorders. Previous studies show that corticostriatal terminals from the functionally related sensorimotor system converge at their interface in the striatum (Flaherty and Graybiel, 1993; Takada et al., 1998). Here, axons from each area synapse onto single fast-spiking GABAergic interneurons. These cells are more responsive to cortical input than the medium spiny cells Figure 5.
