Introduction
The Internet in Everyday Life

CAROLINE HAYTHORNTHWAITE
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign

The increasing presence of the Internet in our everyday life raises important questions about what it means for access to resources, social interaction, and commitment to local community. This special issue of the American Behavioral Scientist brings together seven U.S., one U.K., one Canadian, and one North American study that examine the way in which the Internet competes with and complements everyday life. These studies show the Internet as a complex landscape of applications, purposes, and users. This introduction summarizes results from studies in this issue and other extant recent surveys, providing an overview of the Internet population and its activities, statistics that help define and articulate the nature of the digital divide. The authors move from there to consideration of the social consequences of adding Internet activity to our daily lives, exploring how use of the Internet affects traditional social and communal behaviors such as communication with local family and commitment to geographical communities. They conclude with a look at how these studies reveal the integration of the Internet into our everyday lives.

The Internet--that brave new cyberworld--is it drawing us away from everyday life or adding layers of connectivity and opportunity? Is it supporting new forms of human relationships or reproducing existing patterns of behavior? These questions challenge us to build a picture of Internet use that separates the impact of the Internet from our existing behaviors yet integrates its use with these behaviors. Much existing research on computer- mediated communication (CMC) and online behavior has laid out differences between CMC and face-to-face communication and provided in-depth reports on online communities. Whereas important research has been done from this perspective, its concentration on CMC versus face-to-face, online versus offline, and virtual versus real has perpetuated a dichotomized view of human behavior. These dichotomies pit one form of CMC against another, for example, synchronous chat versus asynchronous communication (e.g., e-mail) and text versus graphics, as well as one category of human endeavor against another, such as computer use at work versus home, online content for adults versus children, and computer and Internet users and nonusers. A growing body of research--including the articles in this special issue--is now examining more integrative views of CMC, looking at

how online time and use fits with and complements other aspects of an individ1 ual's everyday life. A few large and important trends are making it difficult to continue to interpret the impact of the Internet in isolation from people's everyday lives. First, we have a rapid increase in the number of users gaining access to and using the Internet: For example, Katz, Rice, and Aspden (2001 [this issue]) found 8% of their sample using the Internet in 1995 (sample of 2,500 adults in the United States) and 65% in 2000 (1,305 adults). Second, those who are using the Internet are showing an increasing exposure and commitment to Internet-based activity. They spend more time online and do more types of things the more years that they continue to use it (Nie & Erbring, 2000). Estimates put the average American using the Internet more than 9 hours a week (UCLA Center for Communication Policy [CCP], 2000). Although a large proportion of that use can be attributed to work (UCLA CCP, 2000), a third trend shows increasing the domestication of the Internet, that is, the presence of the Internet in the home (Kraut, Kiesler, Mukhopadhyay, Scherlis, & Patterson, 1998). These three trends combine with other societal pressures to blur the boundaries between domains of activity. Such pressures include longer work hours (14% to 16% of those using the Internet more than 1 hour a week report they are working longer hours) (Nie & Erbring, 2000)2; use of the Internet in conjunction with school work by adult learners, university students, and households with children (with the presence of children in the household cited as a key reason many adults will invest in computers and Internet access) (Kraut, Kiesler, et al., 1998; Statistics Canada, 2000)3; and a need to keep up, reported by nonusers as the number one reason for becoming an Internet user (Katz & Aspden, 1997). This special issue of the American Behavioral Scientist brings together seven U.S., one U.K., one Canadian, and one North American study of the Internet in everyday life.4 The overall term the Internet must be used with caution; one can often observe a kind of garbage can model being used as the Internet becomes a receptacle for fame and infamy relating to any electronic activity or societal change. Although the term is still used, the authors in this issue take an integrative approach to assessing this social phenomenon using empirical data on Internet use. They show that the Internet is a complex landscape of applications and purposes as well as users and should be studied that way. They have in common the acceptance of the wholeness of human experience and the idea that the Internet cannot be separated from ongoing activity. The work to be done is to build a picture that situates Internet use in the rest of individuals' lives, including the people with whom they interact, the technologies they have around them, their lifestage and lifestyle (Anderson & Tracey, 2001 [this issue]), and their offline community (Hampton & Wellman, 2001 [this issue]; Kavanaugh & Patterson, 2001 [this issue]; Matei & Ball-Rokeach, 2001 [this issue]). Similarly, we cannot situate individuals' Internet usage without considering their non-Internet attributes and behavior. We cannot ignore the way statistics on Internet use and reach may be predicated on the behaviors and

affordances that already accrue to those in the Internet user demographic, that is, those with higher incomes and higher education levels (Nie, 2001 [this issue]) or that already distinguish behavior offline, for example, in how women and men communicate (Boneva, Kraut, & Frohlich, 2001 [this issue]). We need to consider the multiplicity of interactions and responsibilities online and offline that compose our activities, relationships, and community, looking for patterns of successful integration (e.g., Howard, Rainie, & Jones, 2001 [this issue]; Kazmer & Haythornthwaite, 2001 [this issue]) as we caution against unsuccessful ones (e.g., Kraut, Patterson, et al., 1998). However, our picture and our task are not complete without also considering those who do not have access to the Internet, who use it little, or who have lost access to it (e.g., Katz et al., 2001). It is important to examine how the increasing presence and importance of the Internet in the everyday lives of those with access separates others from the ongoing social, economic, and commercial activity the Internet supports and creates or perpetuates an existing social divide. The articles in this special issue join other researchers in examining the larger picture of the Internet in everyday life. Several major studies and projects provide the basis for the work discussed in this introduction and in the articles in this issue. These include

The following sections summarize results from studies in this issue and other recent surveys to provide an overview of the Internet population and its activities. We begin with a look at who is online, which also shows who is coming online and who has not yet come online, and what these studies tell us they are doing online. Access and use statistics help define and articulate the nature of the

digital divide. We move from there to consideration of the social consequences of adding Internet activity to our daily lives, exploring how use of the Internet affects traditional social and communal behaviors, such as communication with local family and commitment to geographical communities. We conclude with a look at how these studies also reveal the integration of the Internet into our everyday lives.

CONCERNS ABOUT THE DIGITAL DIVIDE Whatever its consequences, all would agree that the Internet is here to stay and spreading rapidly, creating a pressing need to understand and prepare for its impact. The statistics available about the Internet, and those presented in many of the studies in this volume, document the rapid growth in use of the Internet. Here are a few of those numbers: 94 million U.S. adults with Internet access, with 55% of these online on a typical day (Howard et al., 2001), and 55,000 new users each day (UCLA CCP, 2000); 65% of U.S. households with a computer, 43% with access to the Internet, and 55% of Americans with access to the Internet from home or elsewhere (Nie & Erbring, 2000); 20.5 million U.K. adults with home access in 2000, 80% of whom had accessed the Internet in the past month (National Statistics Omnibus, 2000), three times the number of households connected in 1998; and 4.9 million Canadian households with an individual who used the Internet from any location (42% of all households in 1999, compared with 29% in 1997) and 3.4 million households (29%) with use at home (compared with 16% in 1997; Statistics Canada, 2000). Great though these numbers are, they indicate a large proportion of people who are not connected to the Internet, do not know about it, have no interest in using it, have no affordable access to it, or have poor infrastructural support for it. The large social phenomenon of the Internet is passing some by, and for better or worse, that sector is failing to gain access to the resources available to those with access to the Internet. In the United States, differences in access show rural and poor populations to be underrepresented in Internet access and use.6 This difference between the haves and the have nots in Internet access has become known as the digital divide (see National Telecommunications and Information Administration [NTIA], 2000).7 This phenomenon has received the most attention in the United States, where differences in access show rural and poor populations to be underrepresented in Internet access and use.7 The term has also been applied more globally to consider differences between the have and have not nations, although we do not pursue that issue here (see Hargittai & Centeno, 2001). In this issue we look mainly at U.S. Internet use, with one study presenting results from a recent U.K. study (Anderson & Tracey, 2001), one from a Canadian community (Hampton & Wellman, 2001), and one from North America (Wellman et al., 2001). Although there is evidence that the digital divide is shrinking, Katz et al. (2001) find that differences in access still persist across

gender, age, household income, education, and race; and Nie and Erbring (2000) find such differences to be particularly pronounced across education and age.
WHO IS ONLINE?

Of those who have access to the Internet, U.S. users are almost evenly split between men and women, but with higher numbers of younger users; Whites; and those with higher incomes, higher education levels, and more years of access (Howard et al., 2001; Kavanaugh & Patterson, 2001; Nie & Erbring, 2000; UCLA CCP, 2000).8 Currently in the United Kingdom (National Statistics Omnibus, 2000) and previously in the United States, more men than women were likely to have used the Internet. The greatest change in Internet access over time is observed in the previously underrepresented groups: Katz et al. (2001), comparing across cohorts of users in the United States based on the year they began to use the Internet (from 1992 to 2000), found that proportions of women, users older than 40, lower income earners, and non­college graduates have increased most during these years. Similarly, Statistics Canada (2000) reported the highest growth rate in Internet use and home connections for 1999 occurred in older age groups: households headed by seniors 65 years and older, followed by households headed by individuals aged 55 to 64 years. However, their numbers still show fewer regular users in these households compared with younger households (one tenth of households headed by adults older than 65 years had a regular Internet user, one third for the 55- to 64-year-olds, and one half for younger households). Similarly, Nie and Erbring (2000) found much lower access among those older than 65 years compared with those younger than 65 years. As statistics on access show a shrinking digital divide, usage differences become more important for understanding overall Internet activity. Howard et al. (2001) show that on any particular day, of those who have access, more of the men, Whites, higher income earners, higher educated, and more experienced users are likely to be online. For example, 57% of men with access will be online compared with 52% of the women with access, and 56% of Whites compared with 36% of African Americans and 49% of Hispanics with access. Thus, focusing on access alone masks continuing digital divide differences. Similarly, although access as a single measure suggests greater numbers of younger people online, older users are online for more hours. Although this may be because of use associated with work (UCLA CCP, 2000) and the way work hours have crept into home hours (Nie & Erbring, 2000), Anderson and Tracey (2001) find some U.K. users of retirement age to be heavy users, and Nie and Erbring (2000) also found that retired users spend nearly 2 hours more a week using the Internet than nonretired users. Across all studies, the largest and most significant differences in access and use are related to years of experience. Those who have been online longer spend more time online each day and are more likely to be online on any particular day. These "netizens" (Howard et al., 2001) represent the most active and

accomplished users and are the ones who engage in the most kinds of online activities (see also Nie & Erbring, 2000). For specifics on activity differences across demographic characteristics, see the studies in this issue as well as Nie and Erbring (2000) and UCLA CCP (2000). As several authors point out, because all users are getting more experience online, these advanced users potentially show the direction in which Internet use is evolving. Thus, they are an important group to watch. However, it is important to note that at this time in Internet history these users still represent early adopters. Many studies have shown that behaviors and characteristics of such users differ from those of the later majority of adopters: They are more cosmopolitan, more socially active, and have higher incomes and education (Rogers, 1995), characteristics also being found in longtime Internet users. Indeed, several authors point out that the positive social impact of the Internet may reflect attributes of the users rather than any true impact of the Internet itself (see Howard et al., 2001 [this issue]; Nie, 2001 [this issue]). Thus, although an important leading group to watch, experienced users' patterns of use may not wholly predict use by later adopters. Katz et al. (2001) show two other levels at which the digital divide still operates, both of which are consistent with consideration of stages in the adoption of innovations and of adopter characteristics (Rogers, 1995). In this issue they describe how the digital divide operates at the level of awareness of the Internet. Awareness is the initial stage in individual adoption of an innovation and thus a prerequisite for adoption. Those Americans more likely to be aware of the Internet are younger, male, higher income earners, and White. Once awareness is achieved, Katz et al. found no divide based on gender or race (in results for 2000). Similarly, Nie and Erbring (2000) also found that once on the Internet, use looks more homogeneous across all users. The other level at which the digital divide still operates is in discontinuance (Rogers, 1995), that is, in demographics of Internet dropouts. Katz et al. (2001; see also Katz & Aspden, 1997) found that 8% to 11% of users drop out each year--usually younger, less affluent, and less well-educated users (but not proportionally more female or non-White users), for reasons such as lost access, insufficient interest, cost, and/or time. Early discontinuance of an innovation is a characteristic of late adopters, as are lower social connectivity, income, and education levels. These statistics show that considering access as a one-time event will fail to capture the churn in Internet access and use and the behaviors of only partially committed Internet users.
WHAT ARE THEY USING THE INTERNET FOR?

Across all studies, e-mail and searching for information take high priority in Internet time (see Tables 1 and 2 for data on activities by U.S. Internet users [Nie & Erbring, 2000; UCLA CCP, 2000] and Table 3 for U.K. users [National Statistics Omnibus, 2000]; see also Katz & Aspden, 1997; Katz et al., 2001; and

Wellman et al., 2001 for data on North American visitors to the National Geographic Web site). The high use of e-mail--80% to 90% of users--affirms Michael Strangelove's statement that "the Internet is not about technology, it is not about information, it is about communication--people talking to each other, people exchanging e-mail . . . the Internet is a community of chronic communicators" (quoted in Putnam, 2000, p. 171). More than 80% of users use the Internet for e-mail, with an estimated 4 trillion e-mail messages exchanged in the United States in 1998, and 42% of Americans checking their e-mail daily (UCLA CCP, 2000). Users rank e-mail as the number one reason for being online (Katz & Aspden, 1997).

In October 2000, downloading software including games.

The Internet's other main use is for seeking information, for example, hobby, medical, travel, or product information (Katz et al., 2001; Nie & Erbring, 2000; Statistics Canada, 2000; UCLA CCP, 2000). Longtime users, new users, nonusers, and former users all rank this activity as number one or two as a reason for being online (Katz & Aspden, 1997). The UCLA report (UCLA CCP, 2000) found that two thirds of users consider the Internet an important or extremely important source of information, with 80% using the Internet for Web surfing and browsing, and with adults spending more than one quarter of their time online looking for information. Smaller but still large proportions of Internet users are engaging in e-commerce by buying products online: from 36% (SIQSS study) to 50.7% (UCLA study) in the United States and 33% in the United Kingdom (National Statistics Omnibus, 2000). In Canada, 19% of households with access had bought goods or services on the Internet in 1999, up from 9% two years earlier (Statistics Canada, 2000). Whereas some studies find little difference in what people do online once they have access (Katz et al., 2001; Nie & Erbring, 2000), others find differences by gender, age, and race. Some gender differences are observed (although not uniformly) across studies. The Pew studies (Howard et al., 2001) find that men are more likely than women to be using the Internet to seek news, product, financial, or hobby information, or to do work-related research; the UCLA studies concur that men spend more time on commerce activities such as purchasing, banking, or auctions, but find women spend slightly more time on work-related activities (UCLA CCP, 2000). The HomeNet studies suggest that women carry offline communication behaviors online and are more likely to use e-mail for expressive rather than instrumental communication, that is, to exchange small talk and engage in relationship building communications (Boneva et al., 2001). Women also continue the offline characteristic of being the ones responsible for

maintaining ties with kin (Boneva et al., 2001; see also Kazmer & Haythornthwaite, 2001). Howard et al. (2001) did not find major differences between men and women in use of e-mail, but did find 49% of Whites send and read e-mail on a typical day compared with 27% of African Americans in their sample. Nie and Erbring (2000) noted that use of anonymous chat rooms is an activity for the young, with usage substantially lower for those older than age 25.
HOW MUCH TIME DO THEY SPEND ONLINE?

All researchers agree that using the Internet takes time--9.4 hours a week on average in one U.S. estimate, including work (UCLA CCP, 2000). Work-age U.S. users spend the most time online, with those from 19 to 55 years averaging more than 9 hours a week, peaking at 11 hours a week among those 25 to 35 years of age. Younger and older users spend less time online, with 12- to 15-year-olds using the Internet the least at just less than 6 hours a week9 and those older than 65 years using it for just less than 7 hours a week. In the United Kingdom, time online appears to be much lower, at 1 to 3 hours a week across all age groups (Anderson & Tracey, 2001). The number of hours online per week increases sharply with number of years using the Internet, from 6 hours a week for those with less than 1 year of experience to more than 16 hours a week for those with more than 4 years of experience (UCLA CCP, 2000). Activities and reasons for being online also change with experience. Users progress from being online for fun and playing games to being online for a specific reason and using it to accomplish personal or professional work (Howard et al., 2001). Adding Internet-based activities to our daily lives requires a redistribution of our limited personal resources of time and effort. Nie and Erbring (2000) found that significant changes in individuals' lives appear when use exceeds 5 hours a week, and this includes approximately 36% of Internet users in their sample. To accommodate these hours, other activities are displaced. Time may be stolen from local face-to-face exchanges and given to distant friends, stolen from the phone and given to e-mail, and stolen from now with promise of return later. This change is not without controversy. If we spend time communicating via e-mail with distant friends and relatives, we have taken time from local activity. The controversy is not whether we do take time, but whether taking this time has positive or negative consequences. If we expend our social resources on maintaining ties with distant others or with strangers we may never meet face-to-face, this may compromise our local social relationships, which in turn may compromise our individual well-being (Kraut, Patterson, et al., 1998). However, another possibility is that the Internet may help us make connections to others: gaining another source of companionship, emotional support, help with jobs, and so forth, and may fill a void for those who currently operate in an alienating face-to-face environment. Yet another possibility is that the Internet does not embody any dramatic change in behavior but instead exaggerates what we do

already: for example, increasing circles of friends for the outgoing and successful among us, and decreasing the circle for the rest. Sorting out the actual impact of Internet use on social interaction is the second major area addressed in the studies in this issue.

CONCERNS ABOUT SOCIAL INTERACTION We cannot expect to add 16 or more hours a week of Internet time to our daily lives (as do users with more than 4 years of experience) (UCLA CCP, 2000) without changing some patterns of our behavior. As Nie (2001) questions and as Kazmer and Haythornthwaite (2001) examine in detail, when Internet hours are added to already full schedules, what gets dropped? One place Internet hours come from is time previously used to watch television: Internet users spend 28% less time watching television than nonusers, approximately 4.6 hours a week (UCLA CCP, 2000).10 Looking in more detail, Anderson and Tracey (2001) reported a long list of activities that are potentially displaced, but found impacts were marginal at best, including television; gardening; shopping; going to the pub; doing nothing; writing letters; sleeping; playing computer games; and typing on a typewriter. Whereas UCLA CCP (2000) found that their users reported spending the same amount of time reading books and newspapers and talking on the phone, Nie and Erbring (2000) found heavy Internet users cut back on use of all traditional media (television, newspapers, phone to friends and family) as well as shopping in stores and commuting in traffic. Kazmer and Haythornthwaite (2001) found that as time becomes constrained, online learners drop some activities first while preserving others--first to go are more individual activities such as television, reading for pleasure, needlework, and gardening; next to go are leisure activities with friends and work for volunteer groups; and then work, sleep, and eating are compromised. Kept to the end are time with family (particularly children) and work for the educational program itself. Although all studies report decreased time watching television, Internet users in general are more media connected than nonusers--ahead in all categories except in the percentage using the television (tied at 97% of users and nonusers): Books are used by 12% more Internet users than nonusers; video games, 15%; recorded music, 22%; newspapers, 6% (note also that 57% of Internet users report reading news online as a key activity, so this figure may underrepresent overall use of newspapers); radio, 9%; and phone, 3% (UCLA CCP, 2000). This may be a reflection of the higher education and income of Internet users, and it may also again indicate characteristics of the earlier adopters. Their preexisting inclination to use media of all types, combined with familiarity and ease with these media, may have made it easier and less complex for them to adopt computing and the Internet (see Rogers, 1995). It may also have exposed them to

information about the Internet earlier than others, positively enhancing their awareness of the Internet and precipitating earlier adoption. One concern regarding all this time spent online is that the solitary activity engendered by the Internet may displace time formerly spent on local social relations and have an adverse effect on individual well-being (Kraut, Patterson, et al., 1998; Nie, 2001). At another level of analysis
