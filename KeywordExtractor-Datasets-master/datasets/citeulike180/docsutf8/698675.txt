Genomics Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, California 94720, USA; 2U.S. Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute, Walnut Creek, California 94598, USA Cross-species DNA sequence comparison is the primary method used to identify functional noncoding elements in human and other large genomes. However, little is known about the relative merits of evolutionarily close and distant sequence comparisons. To address this problem, we identified evolutionarily conserved noncoding regions in primate, mammalian, and more distant comparisons using a uniform approach (Gumby) that facilitates unbiased assessment of the impact of evolutionary distance on predictive power. We benchmarked computational predictions against previously identified cis-regulatory elements at diverse genomic loci and also tested numerous extremely conserved human­rodent sequences for transcriptional enhancer activity using an in vivo enhancer assay in transgenic mice. Human regulatory elements were identified with acceptable sensitivity (53%­80%) and true-positive rate (27%­67%) by comparison with one to five other eutherian mammals or six other simian primates. More distant comparisons (marsupial, avian, amphibian, and fish) failed to identify many of the empirically defined functional noncoding elements. Our results highlight the practical utility of close sequence comparisons, and the loss of sensitivity entailed by more distant comparisons. We derived an intuitive relationship between ancient and recent noncoding sequence conservation from whole-genome comparative analysis that explains most of the observations from empirical benchmarking. Lastly, we determined that, in addition to strength of conservation, genomic location and/or density of surrounding conserved elements must also be considered in selecting candidate enhancers for in vivo testing at embryonic time points.

The majority of long-range cis-regulatory elements in the human genome have yet to be identified. These gene regulatory modules, which likely number in the tens or hundreds of thousands, are hard to detect, since they lack any obvious distinguishing features analogous to codon structure, splicing motifs, open reading frames, or other hallmarks of protein-coding genes. Furthermore, functional sequences of this class are mostly unique in the genome (Bejerano et al. 2004a), which largely rules out paralogybased identification. The possibility that regulatory elements could lie more than 1 Mb from their target genes (Lettice et al. 2003; Nobrega et al. 2003) presents another challenge. Consequently, cross-species sequence comparisons, which rely upon the slow substitution rate of many categories of functional DNA relative to neutral sequence, have emerged as the pre-eminent means of identifying candidate cis-regulatory elements in large genomes such as human (Pennacchio and Rubin 2001; Nobrega et al. 2003; Ahituv et al. 2004; Chapman et al. 2004; de la CalleMustienes et al. 2005; Hughes et al. 2005; King et al. 2005; Woolfe et al. 2005). Distant comparisons, such as human­fugu (Brenner et al. 1993; Nobrega et al. 2003; de la Calle-Mustienes et al. 2005; Woolfe et al. 2005), have proven especially powerful at highspecificity prediction of functional elements, since neutral sequences have had sufficient time to diverge beyond recognition.

However, despite the similar gene content of the human and fugu genomes, even functional noncoding elements are likely to have diverged over such great distances, as demonstrated by the small number (thousands) of human­fugu conserved noncoding sequences (CNSs) in the genome. At the other extreme, primate sequence comparisons (Boffelli et al. 2003) are likely to capture most functional components of the human genome due to shared biology but suffer from low resolution due to insufficient neutral divergence among primate taxa (Eddy 2005). Mammalian genome comparisons have been proposed as a compromise between the requirements of sequence divergence and biological similarity (Cooper et al. 2003), and efforts are under way to sequence 16 additional mammalian genomes, albeit at low coverage (Margulies et al. 2005). Here, we present an empirical and genomic evaluation of the relative merits of close and distant sequence comparisons at detecting functional noncoding regions in the human genome. Our study complements recent theoretical analyses of this problem (Eddy 2005, Stone et al. 2005) and is directly relevant to the choice of species for whole-genome sequencing and comparative analysis. Additionally, given that regulatory divergence is often proposed as a primary mechanism of phenotypic variation, it is important to characterize the rate of decline of noncoding sequence conservation with increasing evolutionary distance. To impartially assess the effect of evolutionary distance on the predictive power of noncoding conservation, we used a uniform computational approach (Gumby) to detect CNSs in primate, mammalian, and more distant sequence alignments. Close and distant comparisons were tested at three diverse genomic loci, for which numerous cis-regulatory elements have been characterized

experimentally. To complement these empirical results, we performed a whole-genome meta-analysis of human­rodent, human­mouse­chicken, human­mouse­frog, and human­mouse­ fish whole-genome CNS sets and uncovered a general principle linking shallow and deep evolutionary constraint. Finally, we performed systematic in vivo testing of extremely conserved human­rodent CNSs in an in vivo transgenic mouse enhancer assay and identified with high specificity developmental enhancers missed by human­fish comparative analysis, and in the process determined that genomic context is a critical factor in identifying such enhancers. man­rodent) to 228 bp at its "deep" end (human­mouse­ fish). 2. Close-species CNSs are longer and have stronger P-values when they are also conserved in distant species. For example, while human­rodent CNSs conserved in chicken, frog, and fish have median length 712 bp and P-value 4.1e-35, human­ rodent CNSs with no significant nonmammalian conservation have median length 268 bp and P-value 2.2e-06. Since they arise from the characteristic funnel shape of ESPs, we refer to these two trends collectively as the "funnel principle" of noncoding conservation. The funnel principle suggests that highly conserved human­ rodent CNSs should be enriched for conservation in nonmammals. To quantify this enrichment, we sorted whole-genome human­rodent CNSs by P-value and calculated the fraction of human­mouse­chicken, human­mouse­frog, and human­ mouse­fish CNSs overlapped by various quantiles of the human­ rodent set (Fig. 2A). Remarkably, we see that the top 10% of the human­rodent CNSs overlap 60% of the CNSs in the human­ mouse­fish set, 46% of the human­mouse­frog set, and 30% of the human­mouse­chicken set, indicating that a large fraction of deeply conserved CNSs can paradoxically be identified through shallow evolutionary comparisons. Similarly, almost half (47%) of the human­mouse­fish CNSs are contained in the top 5% of the human­rodent set. In terms of probabilities, the highestscoring human­rodent CNSs have an 86% chance of being significantly conserved in chicken, while the lowest-scoring ones have less than a 4% chance of being in the human­mouse­chicken set (Fig. 2B). The corresponding likelihoods are 81% and 0.75% in human­mouse­frog and 64% and 0.2% in human­mouse­fish (see Supplemental Methods for analyses of potential artifacts). Although we see a significant correlation between ancient and recent noncoding conservation, there are also important differences between the two phenomena. While half (2834) of the whole-genome human­mouse­fish CNSs have a human­rodent P-value < 1.9e-28, there are 7686 human­rodent CNSs that meet the same P-value criterion and yet lack significant conservation in fish. These data indicate that human­rodent analysis is capable of identifying a much larger set of unambiguously constrained noncoding elements than are obtainable from mammal­ fish comparison.

Results
Assessment of whole-genome noncoding conservation among mammals and more distant species

Coding exons are known to retain sequence similarity across great evolutionary distances, such as that between human and pufferfish (Aparicio et al. 2002). In contrast, intronic and intergenic conserved elements "evaporate" much more rapidly, thus limiting the sensitivity of distant noncoding sequence comparisons. To quantify the decay of noncoding sequence conservation with evolutionary distance, we generated whole-genome CNS sets through Gumby analysis (see Methods) of the following three-way genome alignments: human­mouse­rat (HMR), human­mouse­chicken (HMG), human­mouse­frog (HMX), and human­mouse­fish (HMF) (see Methods). In the human­rodent alignment, we identified 171,853 CNSs representing 2.2% of the human genome (Gumby P-value 1e-3). At the same P-value threshold, the corresponding CNS statistics were 40,033 and 0.37% for human­mouse­chicken, 14,568 and 0.13% for human­mouse­frog, and 5668 and 0.044% for human­mouse­fish. As expected, the more distantly related genomes exhibit markedly less conservation relative to human, suggesting a reduction in sensitivity that offsets their increased specificity in detecting functional noncoding regions. In order to correlate mammalian and more ancient noncoding conservation, we classified whole-genome CNSs into four primary categories. Category 1 consists of human­rodent CNSs that overlap human­mouse­chicken, human­mouse­frog, and human­mouse­fish CNSs. Category 2 extends only to human­ mouse­frog, Category 3 to human­ mouse­chicken, and Category 4 is restricted to human­rodent alone. Median length and log(P-value) of CNSs within a given category and phylogenetic scope (for instance, Category 2 and human­mouse­frog) were represented by the dimensions of a single rectangular block. Building on such blocks, we define shapes generated by stacking blocks of the same category as evolutionary stacking patterns (ESPs, Fig. 1A­D). Although there is considerable variation Figure 1.

(A) Category 1 CNSs extend to HMF, (B) Category 2 to HMX, (C) Category 3 to HMG, and (D) Category 4 is limited to HMR. Block width is proportional to median CNS length in human, and block area is proportional to the median of log(P-value). Block height thus represents degree of evolutionary constraint at the basepair level. Error bars mark the range from the 25th to the 75th percentile of CNS length. The funnel principle takes its name from the funnel-like shape of ESPs.

dard criterion of 70% sequence identity over 100 bp, thus necessitating some criterion for prioritizing the abundance of human­rodent elements. It has previously been demonstrated that human­ fish conservation constitutes one such criterion for prioritizing human­rodent elements, in that restricting the analysis to human­fish CNSs facilitated the identification of transcriptional enhancers with a high true-positive rate (Nobrega et al. 2003). In the present study, we attempted to achieve a comparable truepositive rate and yet greater sensitivity by focusing instead on the human­ rodent CNSs with the most extreme (i.e., very low) P-values. We first assessed the overlap between the most conserved human­ rodent CNSs and human­fish CNSs in the DACH1 locus. Consistent with the above-described funnel principle, we found that 22 of the 36 strongest human­mouse­rat CNSs in this locus (Pvalue 1e-50) are conserved in at least one of the three available fish genomes. These 22 include five of the seven human­fish CNSs previously validated through in vivo enhancer testing (Nobrega et al. 2003). Thus, in addition to having a high likelihood of ancient conservation in distant species, the 36 human­rodent CNSs with extreme P-values Figure 2.

It is possible that these CNSs are not transcriptional enhancers despite extreme human­rodent conservation, or that their activities are beyond the resolution/sensitivity of this assay or perhaps even that they are enhancers at a different embryonic time point. To determine if extreme human­ mouse­rat CNSs are better able to capture transcriptional enhancers flanking key developmental transcription factor and signaling genes, we tested 13 of the 14 extreme human­rodent CNSs (Pvalue < 1e-40) that lie within the four gene-poor regions on chromosome 16 containing the aforementioned developmental genes. Of these 13 CNSs, five (38%) drove reproducible -galactosidase gene expression, a success rate Figure 3.

Human chromosome 16: Genomic distribution of enhancers active at embryonic day 11.5­12.5
Though reliable indicators of function, human­fish CNSs tend to be limited in number and strongly clustered in genomic regions containing a handful of developmental genes and transcription factors (Sandelin et al. 2004; Woolfe et al. 2005). For example, the human­mouse­fish CNSs on human chromosome 16 are highly skewed towards four gene-poor loci (Fig. 4) containing the developmentally regulated genes SALL1, IRX3, IRX5, IRX6, ATBF1, and WWOX. The density graph of human­rodent CNSs on this chromosome displays peaks at the same locations as human­mouse­ fish and also additional peaks absent in human­mouse­fish. On the basis of positive results from the DACH1 pilot study, we hypothesized that human­rodent CNSs with extreme P-values could also identify developmental transcriptional enhancers in these additional loci, to compensate for their poor coverage by human­mouse­fish CNSs. To test this hypothesis, we focused on the 50 top-scoring "non-fish" human­mouse­rat CNSs on chromosome 16 (Pvalue < 1e-40), of which 36 were located outside the four developmental loci encompassed by human­mouse­fish conservation. We tested 11 of these 36 for in vivo enhancer function through our mouse enhancer transgenesis assay and found to our surprise that not a single one of these 11 CNSs drove a reproducible embryonic expression pattern, in contrast to our experience at the DACH1 locus. Excessive distance between the tested CNSs and their flanking genes is an unlikely explanation for the nega-

The human stem cell leukemia (SCL) locus provides an excellent benchmark for evaluating the effect of phylogenetic scope on comparative sequence analysis, based on the detailed experimental definition of nine nonexonic murine DNaseI-hypersensitive sites (DHSs) and one additional enhancer in the genomic region containing the SCL gene and its flanking intergenic segments (Chapman et al. 2004). Weak homology with chicken has been reported (Göttgens et al. 2000) for a subset of these functional elements in alignments generated using DIALIGN (Brudno et al. 2003a). However, with the exception of one of the SCL promoters, none of the 10 experimentally defined elements shows significant conservation in LAGAN alignments to nonmammalian species such as chicken, frog, fugu, tetraodon, or zebrafish, exemplifying the loss of sensitivity entailed by distant sequence comparisons (data not shown). Given the poor sensitivity of distant sequence comparisons, we aligned the available human, mouse, rat, and dog sequences from this locus (human chr1:47,367,748­47,427,851; NCBI Build 35) using MLAGAN, which yielded a total divergence of 0.79 substitutions/site. At the default P-value threshold of 0.5, Gumby conservation analysis (see Supplemental Methods) detected eight of the 10 experimentally defined noncoding elements, with 11 new predictions (Fig. 5). Thus, as in the case of DACH1, P-value prioritization of CNSs in just a few eutherian genomes is sufficient to identify with acceptable true-positive rate functional elements missed by distant sequence comparison. Of the eight functional regions detected by human­mouse­rat­dog analysis, seven have P-value 1.3e-4, whereas only one of the new pre-

The analyzed genomic region (human chr16:48,339­219,839; NCBI Build 35) spans the block of conserved synteny telomeric to the -globin genes, the -globin genes themselves, and the LUC7L gene. To ensure accurate alignment, we split the locus into four subregions and aligned each subregion separately (see Supplemental Methods). As was the case with the SCL locus, conservation of the benchmark functional elements in distant species is extremely limited; frog and fish have no apparent sequence homology with any of the 17 noncoding functional elements, and chicken shows homology with only two of the 17. Sequence conservation is also limited in opossum, and even hedgehog (which is the most diverged of the eutherians considered here) shows no similarity for five of the 17 benchmark sequence elements (see Hughes et al. [2005] for a detailed breakFigure 4. Extreme human­rodent CNSs with no conservation in fish identify enhancers at e11.5­ down of conservation by species). 12.5 only in certain genomic regions.

The human -globin locus is another well-characterized genomic region, with a recent synthesis of extensive computational and empirical analyses cataloging 17 functional noncoding DNA elements (Hughes et al. 2005).

In addition, this locus is well suited to evaluating the relative merits of close and distant sequence comparisons, due to the availability of

Discussion
Ancient human­fish noncoding conservation has been the mainstay of searches for enhancers of key developmental genes, whereas mammalian sequence comparisons have been considered insufficiently specific, especially in large, highly conserved intergenic regions harboring hundreds of human­rodent CNSs. This dichotomy disappears in light of the funnel principle established by whole-genome meta-analysis of close and distant se-

is limited to genes with complex tissuespecific expression at e11.5/12.5 and produces false negatives in loci that are silent or regulated in a relatively simple manner at this embryonic time point. Since such in vivo tests are expensive and time-consuming, one strategy for large-scale functional genomics would be to prioritize loci that are known to require tissue-specific regulation at the selected developmental stage. Alternatively, one could prioritize loci of unknown function that nevertheless have a high density of ancient (human­ mouse­fish, or perhaps even human­ mouse­frog or human­mouse­chicken) CNSs, since the loci on human chromosome 16 yielding high success rates in the embryonic enhancer assay were originally identified solely on the basis Figure 5.
