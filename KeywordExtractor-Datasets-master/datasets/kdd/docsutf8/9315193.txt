Colibri: fast mining of large static and dynamic graphs Low-rank approximations of the adjacency matrix of a graph are essential in finding patterns (such as communities) and detecting anomalies. Additionally, it is desirable to track the low-rank structure as the graph evolves over time, efficiently and within limited storage. Real graphs typically have thousands or millions of nodes, but are usually very sparse. However, standard decompositions such as SVD do not preserve sparsity. This has led to the development of methods such as CUR and CMD, which seek a non-orthogonal basis by sampling the columns and/or rows of the sparse matrix.
