DynaMMo: mining and summarization of coevolving sequences with missing values Given multiple time sequences with missing values, we propose DynaMMo which summarizes, compresses, and finds latent variables. The idea is to discover hidden variables and learn their dynamics, making our algorithm able to function even when there are missing values.
