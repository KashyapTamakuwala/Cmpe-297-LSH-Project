Pervasive parallelism in data mining: dataflow solution to co-clustering large and sparse Netflix data All Netflix Prize algorithms proposed so far are prohibitively costly for large-scale production systems. In this paper, we describe an efficient dataflow implementation of a collaborative filtering (CF) solution to the Netflix Prize problem [1] based on weighted coclustering [5]. The dataflow library we use facilitates the development of sophisticated parallel programs designed to fully utilize commodity multicore hardware, while hiding traditional difficulties such as queuing, threading, memory management, and deadlocks.
