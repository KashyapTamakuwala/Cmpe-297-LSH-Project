Model order selection for boolean matrix factorization Matrix factorizations---where a given data matrix is approximated by a product of two or more factor matrices---are powerful data mining tools. Among other tasks, matrix factorizations are often used to separate global structure from noise. This, however, requires solving the `model order selection problem' of determining where fine-grained structure stops, and noise starts, i.e., what is the proper size of the factor matrices.
