Sparsification of influence networks We present Spine, an efficient algorithm for finding the "backbone" of an influence network. Given a social graph and a log of past propagations, we build an instance of the independent-cascade model that describes the propagations. We aim at reducing the complexity of that model, while preserving most of its accuracy in describing the data.
