Balanced allocation with succinct representation Motivated by applications in guaranteed delivery in computational advertising, we consider the general problem of balanced allocation in a bipartite supply-demand setting. Our formulation captures the notion of deviation from being balanced by a convex penalty function. While this formulation admits a convex programming solution, we strive for more robust and scalable algorithms.
