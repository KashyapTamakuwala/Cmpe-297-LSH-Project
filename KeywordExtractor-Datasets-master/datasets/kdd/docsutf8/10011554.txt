Constructing comprehensive summaries of large event sequences Event sequences capture system and user activity over time. Prior research on sequence mining has mostly focused on discovering local patterns. Though interesting, these patterns reveal local associations and fail to give a comprehensive summary of the entire event sequence. Moreover, the number of patterns discovered can be large. In this paper, we take an alternative approach and build short summaries that describe the entire sequence, while revealing local associations among events.
