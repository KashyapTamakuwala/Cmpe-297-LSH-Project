Constrained optimization for validation-guided conditional random field learning Conditional random fields(CRFs) are a class of undirected graphical models which have been widely used for classifying and labeling sequence data. The training of CRFs is typically formulated as an unconstrained optimization problem that maximizes the conditional likelihood. However, maximum likelihood training is prone to overfitting. To address this issue, we propose a novel constrained nonlinear optimization formulation in which the prediction accuracy of cross-validation sets are included as constraints. Instead of requiring multiple passes of training, the constrained formulation allows the cross-validation be handled in one pass of constrained optimization.
