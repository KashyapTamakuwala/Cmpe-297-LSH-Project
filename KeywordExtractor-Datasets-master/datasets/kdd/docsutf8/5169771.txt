Detecting time series motifs under uniform scaling Time series motifs are approximately repeated patterns foundwithin the data. Such motifs have utility for many data mining algorithms, including rule-discovery,novelty-detection, summarization and clustering. Since the formalization of the problem and the introduction of efficient linear time algorithms, motif discovery has been successfully applied tomany domains, including medicine, motion capture, robotics and meteorology.
