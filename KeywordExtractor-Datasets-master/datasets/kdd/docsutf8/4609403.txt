Finding low-entropy sets and trees from binary data The discovery of subsets with special properties from binary data hasbeen one of the key themes in pattern discovery. Pattern classes suchas frequent itemsets stress the co-occurrence of the value 1 in the data. While this choice makes sense in the context of sparse binary data, it disregards potentially interesting subsets of attributes that have some other type of dependency structure.
