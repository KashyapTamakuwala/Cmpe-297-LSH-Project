Better abstractions for secure server-side scripting It is notoriously difficult to program a solid web application. Besides addressing web interactions, state maintenance, and whimsical user navigation behaviors, programmers must also avoid a minefield of security vulnerabilities. The problem is twofold.

Second, we lack proper abstractions for hiding common and subtle coding details that are orthogonal to the business functionalities of specific web applications.
