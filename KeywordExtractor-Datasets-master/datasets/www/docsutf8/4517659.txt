Web4CE: accessing web-based applications on consumer devices In a world where all devices will be interconnected, the boundaries between the different devices will start to disappear. Devices will be able to access each other's applications; sessions can be suspended on one device and resumed on another device; devices can serve as each other's input and output device, and all devices will be able to connect to the Internet. This will give true mobility to the user as he/she will not be restricted to the time and location where he/she accesses an application. Of course, we need a variety of different mechanisms and technologies to enable this, such as: Remote rendering of UIs on other devices in the network. Infrastructure for discovering client and servers in a network. Mechanisms to exchange capability information between devices, and to adapt the UI based on these capabilities. Mechanisms to deal with session migration.Support for a wide range of consumer devices, ranging from mobile phones to high-end TVs.
