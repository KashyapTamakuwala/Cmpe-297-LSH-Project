Alhambra: a system for creating, enforcing, and testing browser security policies Alhambra is a browser-based system designed to enforce and test web browser security policies. At the core of Alhambra is a policy-enhanced browser supporting fine-grain security policies that restrict web page contents and execution. Alhambra requires no server-side modifications or additions to the web application. Policies can restrict the construction of the document as well as the execution of JavaScript using access control rules and a taint-tracking engine. Using the Alhambra browser, we present two security policies that we have built using our architecture, both designed to prevent cross-site scripting. The first policy uses a taint-tracking engine to prevent cross-site scripting attacks that exploit bugs in the client-side of the web applications. The second one uses browsing history to create policies that restrict the contents of documents and prevent the inclusion of malicious content.
