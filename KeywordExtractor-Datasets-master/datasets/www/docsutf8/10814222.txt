Privacy in dynamic social networks Anonymization of social networks before they are published or shared has become an important research question. Recent work on anonymizing social networks has looked at privacy preserving techniques for publishing a single instance of the network. However, social networks evolve and a single instance is inadequate for analyzing the evolution of the social network or for performing any longitudinal data analysis. We study the problem of repeatedly publishing social network data as the network evolves, while preserving privacy of users. Publishing multiple instances of the same network independently has privacy risks, since stitching the information together may allow an adversary to identify users in the networks.
