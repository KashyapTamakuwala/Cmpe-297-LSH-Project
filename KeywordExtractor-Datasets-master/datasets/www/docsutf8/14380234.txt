Learning from the past: answering new questions with past answers Community-based Question Answering sites, such as Yahoo! Answers or Baidu Zhidao, allow users to get answers to complex, detailed and personal questions from other users. However, since answering a question depends on the ability and willingness of users to address the asker's needs, a significant fraction of the questions remain unanswered. We measured that in Yahoo! Answers, this fraction represents 15% of all incoming English questions. At the same time, we discovered that around 25% of questions in certain categories are recurrent, at least at the question-title level, over a period of one year.
