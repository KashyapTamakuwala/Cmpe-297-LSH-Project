Detection and analysis of drive-by-download attacks and malicious JavaScript code JavaScript is a browser scripting language that allows developers to create sophisticated client-side interfaces for web applications. However, JavaScript code is also used to carry out attacks against the user's browser and its extensions. These attacks usually result in the download of additional malware that takes complete control of the victim's platform, and are, therefore, called "drive-by downloads." Unfortunately, the dynamic nature of the JavaScript language and its tight integration with the browser make it difficult to detect and block malicious JavaScript code.
