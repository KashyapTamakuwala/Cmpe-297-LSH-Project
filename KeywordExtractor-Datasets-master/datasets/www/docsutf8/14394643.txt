Recommendations to boost content spread in social networks Content sharing in social networks is a powerful mechanism for discovering content on the Internet.

Existing schemes for recommending connections in social networks are based on the number of common neighbors, similarity of user profiles, etc. However, such similarity-based connections do not consider the amount of content discovered.
