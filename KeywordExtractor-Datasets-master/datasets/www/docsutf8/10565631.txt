Mind the data skew: distributed inferencing by speeddating in elastic regions Semantic Web data exhibits very skewed frequency distributions among terms. Efficient large-scale distributed reasoning methods should maintain load-balance in the face of such highly skewed distribution of input data. We show that term-based partitioning, used by most distributed reasoning approaches, has limited scalability due to load-balancing problems.
