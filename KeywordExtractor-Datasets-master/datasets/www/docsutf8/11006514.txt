Scalable techniques for document identifier assignment in inverted indexes Web search engines depend on the full-text inverted index data structure. Because the query processing performance is so dependent on the size of the inverted index, a plethora of research has focused on fast end effective techniques for compressing this structure. Recently, several authors have proposed techniques for improving index compression by optimizing the assignment of document identifiers to the documents in the collection, leading to significant reduction in overall index size.
