Flexible on-device service object replication with replets An increasingly large amount of Web applications employ service objects such as Servlets to generate dynamic and personalized content. Existing caching infrastructures are not well suited for caching such content in mobile environments because of disconnection and weak connection. One possible approach to this problem is to replicate Web-related application logic to client devices. The challenges to this approach are to deal with client devices that exhibit huge divergence in resource availabilities, to support applications that have different data sharing and coherency requirements, and to accommodate the same application under different deployment environments.
