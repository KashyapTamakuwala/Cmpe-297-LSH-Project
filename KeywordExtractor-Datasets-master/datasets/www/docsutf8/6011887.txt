Visibly pushdown automata for streaming XML We propose the study of visibly pushdown automata (VPA) for processing XML documents. VPAs are pushdown automata where the input determines the stack operation, and XML documents are naturally visibly pushdown with the VPA pushing onto the stack on open-tags and popping the stack on close-tags. In this paper we demonstrate the power and ease visibly pushdown automata give in the design of streaming algorithms for XML documents.
