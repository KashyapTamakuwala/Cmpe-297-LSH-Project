Tag-based social interest discovery The success and popularity of social network systems, such as del.icio.us, Facebook, MySpace, and YouTube, have generated many interesting and challenging problems to the research community. Among others, discovering social interests shared by groups of users is very important because it helps to connect people with common interests and encourages people to contribute and share more contents.
