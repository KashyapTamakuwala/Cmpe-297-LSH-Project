Online team formation in social networks We study the problem of online team formation. We consider a setting in which people possess different skills and compatibility among potential team members is modeled by a social network. A sequence of tasks arrives in an online fashion, and each task requires a specific set of skills. The goal is to form a new team upon arrival of each task, so that (i) each team possesses all skills required by the task, (ii) each team has small communication overhead, and (iii) the workload of performing the tasks is balanced among people in the fairest possible way.
