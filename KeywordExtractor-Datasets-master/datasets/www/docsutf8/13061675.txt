Filtering microblogging messages for social tv Social TV was named one of the ten most important emerging technologies in 2010 by the MIT Technology Review. Manufacturers of set-top boxes and televisions have recently started to integrate access to social networks into their products. Some of these systems allow users to read microblogging messages related to the TV program they are currently watching. However, such systems suffer from low precision and recall when they use the title of the show as keywords when retrieving messages, without any additional filtering.
