FOREWORD
In accordance with the widely adopted market-oriented economic principles, most countries in Latin America and the Caribbean have progressed in the process of deregulation, privatization and external opening of their economies. Along with the rest of the economy, regional policies have progressively emphasized the role of market forces in agriculture as the main mechanisms for resource allocation. This process implies a redefinition of the role of the public sector in agriculture. As shown by the region's recent experience, radical changes in strategy involve the risk of falling from one extreme to another, that is, from an excessive intervention in the productive market mechanisms to an excessive absence of the public sector.
These issues gain relevance in the context of the generally moderate performance of regional agriculture production in recent years. Among the various factors behind such trends, what has been the role of the new policy strategies? More specifically, do farmers overall, or at least a large number of them, risk being the great losers of free-market reform? Although this much debated question can only be answered in the longer term, the issue has immediate implications for policy-makers.
The present study analyses the significance of this new economic context for the design of policies for the agricultural sector. In addition, it analyses and assesses recent trends in agricultural development policy in Latin America, to identify and synthesize new policy directions, and to highlight emerging challenges and avenues for policy innovation. The main conclusion of the study is that Latin American agricultural and rural development policy is at a turning point that will require bold new initiatives to improve the production performance of agriculture, reduce rural poverty, protect the natural resource base of the sector and ensure the political sustainability of economic growth. This will require a pro-active set of interventions designed at restoring the specificity of sectorial agricultural policy while maintaining consistency with the macro reforms.
We believe that this study is a valid contribution to understand the experience of Latin America concerning the impact of macroeconomic policy reforms on agriculture and the rural sector over the past two decades and the main changes in the agricultural policy instruments. It also offers several concrete suggestions for transitional and new market compatible policies, that should help guide and orient the process of policy formulation and policy advice in the Region.

SUMMARY
The overall Latin American economic, political and institutional framework has substantially changed in the last two decades, in part as a consequence of the implementation of structural adjustment programmes. This study reviews some of the implications of these changes on the design and implementation of agricultural policy and provides concrete suggestions regarding the utilization of some new agricultural policy instruments.
Part I of the document gives an overview of how the general evolution of Latin American countries towards the adoption of market oriented economic policies and the retrenchment of the state in the wake of economic reform are affecting the design of policies and the structure of policy making institutions. The authors conclude that agricultural policy reforms in the last decade can be characterized as a process of preponderance of macroeconomic policy over sectoral policy i.e., of trimming and cancelling government programmes and policies in agriculture that could not be justified under the free market-free trade paradigm. For this reason, despite, or perhaps because of the retrenchment of the state, there is an emerging consensus on the need for a more active role of the state in redressing the social failings of the market system.
Part II addresses the macroeconomic and agricultural sector performance of Latin American and the Caribbean region between 1970 and 1994. The analysis is divided into three different periods according to macroeconomic performance, for each country, and broadly associated with different policy regimes. The authors' conclusion on this topic is that during the three periods, the rate of expansion and contraction of agricultural value added per capita was less than the one for GDP per capita, but the growth in labor productivity was in all cases greater than the per capita agricultural growth rates. Therefore, while total output for the sector could barely keep up with the growth in population, labor productivity in the sector was increasing, implying economic restructuring, rural out-migration, and higher average rural incomes. With regard to the performance of the agricultural sector, the document concludes that the successful macroeconomic reforms and the associated changes
in agricultural policies resulted in a higher growth of agricultural output than the one achieved under import substitution industrialization and debt accumulation.
Part III analyses the evolution of agricultural policy in the specific areas of trade, product and factor markets, land reform and land markets, research and extension, and irrigation. For each topic the authors discuss the recent policy reforms, giving examples of how they have been implemented; the transitional issues surrounding the adoption of reforms, including obstacles to their adoption and policies used in facilitating the transitions; and the new market compatible policies, including examples of how they are being implemented, how they differ from old approaches to the same problems, and what types of new challenges they raise for policy makers and rural constituencies.
Part IV explores emerging trends, issues, and challenges that define current policy debates and impact on the organization of policy making institutions, including local responses to globalization, policy differentiation, new approaches to poverty reduction, institutional reform and reconstruction, and the sequencing of reforms. The authors conclude that, in recent years, considerable emphasis has been placed on the implications of the heterogeneous nature of the rural population for the analysis of the differentiated impact of policy reforms and for the design of differentiated policies and interventions. Differentiated interventions are not new, but recent progress in decentralization, democratization, and increased participation of civil societies through representative grassroots and corporativist organizations give new potential for differentiated intervention to play a more effective role in favor of the rural poor.
Finally Part V summarizes the main themes of the paper and presents proposals for the future direction of agricultural policies in the Region, and concludes that presently there is a vast array of opportunities for new initiatives toward a more effective agricultural and rural policy compatible with, but not subordinate, to macropolicy reforms.

1. Washington Consensus and Agriculture
2. Redefining the Role of the State
3. New Approaches to Agricultural Development Policy
The purpose of this paper is to analyze and assess recent trends in agricultural development policy in Latin America, to identify and synthesize new policy directions, and to highlight emerging challenges and avenues for policy innovation. The paper begins with an overview of how the general evolution of the Latin American countries toward the adoption of neoliberal economic policies and the retrenchment of the state in the wake of economic reform are impacting the design of policies and the structure of policy making institutions. Part II examines economic and agricultural performance in Latin America during the last 25 years. This section provides a necessary benchmark from which to judge the success or failure of recent policy reforms. Part III analyzes the evolution of agricultural policy in the specific areas of trade, product and factor markets, land reform and land markets, research and extension, and irrigation. Part IV explores emerging trends, issues, and
challenges that define current policy debates and impact the structure of policy making institutions, including local responses to globalization, policy differentiation, new approaches to poverty reduction, institutional reform and reconstruction, and the sequencing of reforms. The final section summarizes the main themes of the paper and presents a normative perspective on the future direction of agricultural policy in the region.
1. Washington Consensus and Agriculture
While economic reforms had been initiated as early as 1973 in Chile and Uruguay, and briefly in 1976 in Argentina, in the other Latin American countries it was the debt crisis of 1982 that triggered a series of reforms that have become the foundation for Latin America's current strategy of economic development. With International Monetary Fund and World Bank assistance, countries burdened with debt service obligations designed austerity programs for their economies that included reductions in central government expenditures (government budget deficits fell from a continental average of 5.5% of GDP in 1988 to 1.8% in 1995), decreases in the growth in money supply, exchange rate devaluation, and wage repression. Structural adjustment loans were tied to economic reforms that included the removal of trade barriers and impediments to foreign investment, financial liberalization, privatization of state enterprises, deregulation, and reforms of the tax system and property rights
laws (Williamson, 1995). Inspired by the success of the high growth East Asian countries, the neoliberal, export-oriented approach to development has become, in the after-math of the debt crisis, the dominant paradigm of economic development in the region. As a result, adoption of free market-free trade (FMFT) policies in Latin America has been widespread, with almost all countries in the region conforming, to various extents, to the orthodoxy of the "Washington consensus", even if frequently combined with non-orthodox instruments, particularly in transitory attempts at price controls.
Structural adjustment and the process of adopting FMFT policies are re-defining the relationship between agricultural policy and economic and social policy, and altering the context of the debate surrounding the choice of an agricultural development strategy (Schydlowsky, 1995; Woller, 1994; Sheahan, 1992). For the most part, agricultural policy reforms have occurred in the context of broader economic reforms, and agricultural policy has in most instances been directly dictated by macroeconomic policy, with often little explicit concern for agriculture, rural development, or poverty. The perceived success of FMFT policies in curtailing inflation (which fell from a regional average of 196% in 1991 to 19% in 1995), promoting trade (intra-regional trade doubled in the 1990-94 period and regional exports grew at the average annual rate of 6%), attracting foreign investment, and restoring economic growth has served to entrench the fundamental precepts of the neo-liberal paradigm,
causing contemporary agricultural policy debates to center less on whether and where to apply market-oriented prescriptions, and more on how to implement these policies while meeting the economic and social criteria of the sector. As many countries in the region are emerging from the economic crisis, increased attention is being focused on designing and implementing policies that maximize economic efficiency within a market compatible framework, while pursuing social objectives that consider poverty, inequality, sustainability, and income growth.
In spite of renewed growth, the FMFT reforms have been far from successful. Recoveries remain weak with a continental growth rate in GDP of only 0.8% in 1995 and an expected 3% in 1996, with setbacks in Mexico, Argentina, Peru, and Venezuela. Unemployment remains high in most countries and real wages have failed to rise in spite of recoveries. While the incidence of poverty has fallen where recoveries have occurred, inequality has either failed to decline or increased (Altimir, 1995). Cuts in subsidies and rising prices for public services have reduced the welfare of the middle class. Perception that the benefits of growth are not fairly shared is widespread. Progress in democratic representation is exposing governments to sharp pressures against continuation of the reforms. Popular discontent has taken the form of guerrilla insurgencies in Mexico, Colombia, and Peru, opposition to the presence of technocrats in higher office in the ruling party in Mexico, strong showing of
the opposition parties in the presidential elections in Nicaragua, election of populist leaders in Ecuador and Venezuela, and increased symptoms of social breakdown, including urban violence, delinquency, drug trafficking, and corruption of the police and judicial systems. Managing the social backlash to the FMFT reforms, and adjusting the course of these reforms to increase their political sustainability, are currently among the prime concerns of Latin American policy makers and international development agencies. The sustainability of economic recoveries, dependent as they are on foreign direct investment and hence on the perceived investment climate, hinges upon ability of the Latin American governments to manage the political feasibility of the reforms. And this affects the course of agricultural and rural development policies as well.
2. Redefining the Role of the State
The move towards freer markets has required governments to surrender control over many of the policy instruments that were used as the pillars of the import substitution industrialization (ISI) strategies that prevailed until the introduction of the reforms, and that served to either tax or compensate the agricultural sector, with a net bias against agriculture (Schiff and Valdés). Examples of policy instruments no longer at the disposal of governments adhering to the FMFT orthodoxy cover the spectrum of public policy. Tariff rates and quantity restrictions on trade have in principle been eliminated or subjected to international regulation under the terms of particular trade agreements. Many countries have moved from fixed, and often multiple, exchange rates to floating or "pegged" rate regimes. In regards to product and factor markets, subsidies, price controls, and quantity restrictions have been eliminated or greatly descaled, with prices and output increasingly market
determined. Credit subsidies and special credit programs have been reduced, with interest rates and the composition of borrowers removed from policy discretion. Land markets have been deregulated and agrarian laws changed, freeing the land market to respond to market forces.
In practice, however, governments have had varying degrees of success in surrendering control over these policy instruments. Quantity restrictions have effectively been removed and tariffication has been widespread, including the use of tariff-rate quotas as instruments compatible with elimination of quantity restrictions. However, uneven progress toward freer trade is due to both pressures of farm producers and fiscal interests of governments. In general, the dilemma of agricultural trade liberalization in the early 1990s is that it has occurred in an adverse context of falling international commodity prices, appreciating real exchange rates, high interest rates, and falling subsidies, all of which have combined in creating serious profitability crises for agriculture (Valdés, 1996; Gardner, 1996). This is generating pressures on governments to either restore protection of the import-competing sectors or seek direct income transfers decoupled from price interventions. For
governments, trade interventions were sources of economic revenues (export taxes and import tariffs) and political power (discretion over the allocation of exemptions and compensatory subsidies; see Bates, 1981) for policy makers and bureaucrats, and have economically benefited politically influential vested interest groups who appropriated the compensations through rent seeking activities. As a result, Valdés (1996) observes that the effective rate of protection remains sizeably negative on exportables in many countries (Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Paraguay, and Uruguay) while there is protection for the import competing sectors. Progress toward reducing the anti-agriculture bias in price policy has thus been highly uneven across countries and commodities. Most particularly, the anti-agriculture bias of direct price interventions has, except where there are transitory foreign exchange crises as in Mexico, been replaced by indirect taxation as a consequence of
appreciation of real exchange rates associated with capital inflows. Indeed, the chronic weakness of domestic savings creates a strong policy dilemma between growth and appreciation as foreign capital inflows must be relied upon as the primary source of investable funds.
To a great extent, agricultural policy reforms in the last decade can be characterized as a process of "rationalization" of sectoral policy with macro policy, i.e., of trimming and cancelling government programs and policies in agriculture that could not be justified under the FMFT paradigm. Hence, there has been a paring down, if not the complete elimination, of government functions not satisfying the classical rationalizations for state intervention in a market-oriented system. The role for government is increasingly limited to the promotion and regulation of free and competitive markets, and to the provision of goods and services where markets fail - as in the cases of public goods, negative externalities, natural monopolies, asymmetric information, economies of scale, and very high start-up costs. In terms of agricultural programs, the public goods character of infrastructure - such as transportation, marketing, and irrigation - and services such as research, extension,
and export promotion justify at least partial public provision. Negative externalities call for government intervention in environmental protection and resource management. Asymmetric information may cause markets to fail and may justify a public role in, for instance, the certification of seeds or product quality. Government is also expected to provide the legal institutions to enforce property rights (land titling, patents on technological innovations), enforce anti-trust legislation, and regulate rural financial and crop insurance systems.
With the loss of policy domain over many classical instruments of agricultural policy resulting from market liberalization and the submission of agriculture to macroeconomic policy reforms, the scaling back of government programs through the process of rationalization and privatization, and the downsizing of government intervention due to fiscal austerity measures, the state has played a less active role in agricultural policy during the last decade, both in terms of economic and social objectives. The ascendancy of the market paradigm has caused the role of the state and agricultural policy to be increasingly determined by the needs and limitations of the market system. Beyond its role of facilitating a competitive market system, agricultural policy has been defined negatively by that which the market cannot accomplish either because markets fail or do not exist, or because they produce socially undesirable outcomes. In addition, while macropolicy has been typically
proactive (e.g., the promotion of regional trade agreements, greater independence of central banks), agricultural policy has all too often been a passive appendage of macropolicy initiatives, seeking adjustments of sector to macro initiatives as opposed to pursuing proactively specific sectoral policies. Instead of focusing on differentiated complementary microeconomic reforms to promote the competitiveness of the different classes of farm producers, policy reforms have had a tendency to focus on macro-level adjustments and on the design of government interventions to compensate losers in the transition to FMFT policies in order to make the reforms politically feasible.
3. New Approaches to Agricultural Development Policy
Despite, or perhaps because of, the retrenchment of the state, there is an emerging consensus on the need for a more active role for the state in redressing the social failings of the market system (UNICEF, UNDP, FAO, CEPAL). This emergence coincides with a growing appreciation that market-oriented economics does not necessarily imply an adherence to laissez-faire social policy. Free competitive markets, while economically efficient, may be "socially" inefficient, justifying state intervention when markets fail in terms of social criteria. Citizens may express via political systems preferences for an allocation of goods, income, or wealth among the population, or over time, that differ from the market allocation. These social preferences may differ in terms of: (i) poverty and equality - that is, the intra-generational distribution of income or wealth; (ii) sustainability - that is, the inter-generational distribution of income or wealth; or (iii) economic growth - the
market induced growth rate may not equal the socially optimal growth rate. The state, via macro and agricultural policy, can alter market outcomes ex ante or redress outcomes ex post.
While the scope for state intervention is large, the ascendancy of the market orthodoxy has had important implications for the design of development policies that address the main issues of poverty, equality, sustainability, and growth. New market-based policies are distinguished from older approaches to the same social issues by the compatibility of the new policies with the FMFT paradigm. Market-compatible policies alter market outcomes while maintaining, as much as possible, the fundamental market incentives. In other words, these policies attempt to achieve social goals while minimizing price distortions, and respecting constraints dictated by supply and demand, price stability, budgetary balance, and equilibrium in the balance of current accounts.
Some of the defining characteristics of the market-compatible agricultural development programs include: (i) minimal direct government involvement in markets - policies are achieved through economic signals (taxes and subsidies) rather than through government ownership; (ii) targeting specific groups for assistance through differentiated interventions; (iii) using lump sum transfers as opposed to price policies to minimize market distortions; (iv) improving the access to assets, reducing the transactions costs, and raising the productivity of targeted groups (to allow their own initiatives in the context of market forces to raise their incomes); (v) using market transfers of productive assets rather than legislative control (e.g., grants to poor to purchase land rather than imposing size limits on land holdings and tenancy controls); (vi) maximizing the use of the private rather than the public sector (e.g., the private provision of publicly funded extension); and (vii)
decentralizing governance to seek to achieve both efficiency and welfare gains in policy making and government interventions compared to central administration. Some contemporary policy reforms have tried to achieve social objectives such as increasing the productivity of the poor, or raising nutritional levels, while maximizing the use of the private sector (corporate initiatives as well as grassroots, corporatist, and non-governmental organizations), reducing government bureaucracy, and minimizing efficiency losses resulting from economic distortions.
While the methods of approaching social issues are increasingly guided by the market orthodoxy, the extent to which the state should intervene to promote agricultural development remains fundamentally a political issue, determined by the balance of power between groups within countries. The scope and scale of redistributive policies, and the level of social welfare expenditures on rural development are determined through the political process. The political arena is also where intertemporal tradeoffs in the use of natural resources will be resolved, where the immediate needs of the poor for land to farm or graze will be weighed against the preservation of ecosystems for future generations (ECLAC, 1991; Bramble, 1995). Political battles over present versus future consumption will determine expenditures on research and extension, investment in infrastructure, and tax and saving programs.
In recent years, major changes have occurred in the balance of forces from which policy making and implementation emerges, leading to new approaches to agricultural development policy. Most Latin American governments have made significant progress toward greater democratic representation and toward decentralization of governance. Complementary to these changes, civil society has made a quantum jump in the degree of organization, particularly of the historically weaker segments of society. The last decade has witnessed a proliferation of grassroots and non-governmental organizations that have incorporated many of the rural poor, both as clients of service organizations and as instruments of political representation. As a consequence, new attention has been given to institutional reforms and constituent organizations as a way of improving the allocation of public resources given the diverse needs of an heterogeneous population. Heterogeneity results from highly varied asset
endowments and highly varied constraints on performance resulting from differential access to markets, credit, infrastructure, information, and insurance. An heterogeneous population inevitably demands and requires a highly differentiated policy response to the problems of competitiveness, poverty, and sustainability. Decentralization of governance and proliferating social movements have induced governments to be increasingly responsive to the diverse needs of the population, and have increased the ability of the neediest segments of the population to fight within their political framework for greater access to public services by what has become known as demand-driven development.

II. Economic and Agricultural Performance and the Changing Policy Environment
1. Economic Performance and Policy Environment
2. Agricultural Performance
Latin American agriculture has been exposed to large macroeconomic and sectoral policy shocks. Before we analyze these policies in detail, it is important to assess whether the combination of shocks and reforms has resulted in a stagnant or growing agricultural sector and in stagnant or growing labor productivity in agriculture. Recent analyses of agricultural policy reforms have concluded that reforming agriculture is extremely difficult and that it has rarely been successful, with Chile, Ghana, and New Zealand among the few success stories (Gardner, 1996). Failure for the reforms to result in an improved performance of agriculture has been blamed on (i) unfavorable macroeconomic contexts, particularly overvalued currencies and excessively high real interest rates, and (ii) political difficulties of sustaining the reforms, leading to a return to protectionism.
This section provides an overview of macroeconomic and agricultural sector performance for the Latin American and Caribbean region between 1970 and 1994. Our analysis divides the two and a half decades since 1970 into three distinct epochs distinguished, for each country, by macroeconomic performance, and broadly associated with distinct policy regimes:
· Early growth, starting in 1970, and lasting for as long as per capita GDPs are rising. It is a period characterized by ISI policies, debt accumulation, and ultimately unsustainable fiscal and trade policies.
· Recession, characterized by falling per capita GDPs, and the initiation of stabilization and structural adjustment policies.
· Late growth, characterized by economic recovery in per capita GDP growth, with relaxation of stabilization policies (including fiscal austerity and competitive exchange rates) and a deepening of neoliberal policy reforms.
The analysis also focuses on discerning the features of strong economic performance in the late growth period. The countries used in the study were grouped into 2 categories:
· Rapid late growth: countries with annual GDP per capita growth rates in the late growth period that were greater than the sample average growth rate (2.75%/year.)
· Slow late growth: countries with GDP growth rates in the late growth period that were lower than the sample average growth rate.
The analysis looks for correspondences between economic performance and the macro-economic policy environment (real exchange rates, inflation, government expenditures) and indicators of agricultural sector performance (agricultural value added per capita, agricultural labor productivity, and rural population density). The country-level data are presented in separate tables in the appendix; the aggregate group data are presented in the summary table.
1. Economic Performance and Policy Environment
Table 1 lists the gross domestic product per capita growth rates of 20 Latin America and Caribbean countries from 1970 to 1994.^1 Of the 20 countries, 5 did not fit into the 3-period trichotomy used for our analysis: Brazil^2, Haiti, and Nicaragua did not have a late growth period; Jamaica never suffered a significant recession; and Chile was excluded because it had only a very short (though severe) recessionary period 1981-83, and because its macro-economic policies did not conform to the general three-period classification as it began adopting neoliberal policies early in the early growth period. Figure 1 graphically illustrates the GDP per capita growth rate and the associated periods for each country.
^1 Data was only available to 1993 for the 6 countries indicated in the table.
^2 Interestingly, although Brazil has failed to enter a strong recovery, it rapid early growth performance was such that its performance over all three periods (1.61%) is among the best in Latin America.
The early growth period terminated for 12 of the 15 countries between 1979 and 1981, corresponding with the debt crisis, a world wide recession, and the onset of structural adjustment policies. GDP growth began again for 12 of the 15 countries between 1985 and 1990. Most rapid growth countries have had a sufficiently strong recovery to achieve positive growth rates since the onset of the recession, that is for periods 2 and 3. The slow growth countries still have not recovered, on average, their pre-recession GDP per capita levels. Despite significant inter-period differences in performance, both groups performed on average almost exactly identically over the whole 24 year period.
Another perspective on past economic performance is derived from an examination of policy-sensitive economic indicators such as the real exchange rate, inflation, and government expenditures. We use the same country and period groupings derived from the GDP per capita growth rates to observe correspondences between economic performance, growth epochs, and policy instruments.
Table 2 indicates the average annual growth rates of the real exchange rates for the three periods for each country and both groups. The real exchange rates of both groups of countries depreciated during the recession period. In contrast during the late period, the average real exchange rate appreciated in the rapid growth countries while it continued to depreciate in the slow growth countries. This result is, however, somewhat deceptive in part because it reflects the policies of the statistical outliers (Peru, Argentina, and Honduras). In fact, in six of the eight slow growth countries, the real exchange rate appreciated, indicating that almost all countries in the region (except Honduras) reversed the exchange rate depreciations that had occurred in the recessionary period. The impact of the real exchange rate on imports and exports is shown in figure 2.
