Storage of Pesticides
As a general principle, systems of storage should be flexible and adaptable.
Stacking positions and heights
Stock should be arranged to use the oldest first ("first in first out" principle) and to prevent obsolete stock from accumulating. Containers should be arranged to minimize handling and thus avoid mechanical damage giving rise to leaks. Floor spaces should be uncluttered, with marked, 1-m wide, gangways between shelves or stacks (Figure 11) that permit easy inspection and allow free air flow (Figure 12). This also enables immediate clean-up in the event of any leakage or spills, which can be seen quickly. Climbing on pesticide containers to reach other containers should not be necessary - damaged or corroded metal drums can easily give way under a person's weight and this leads to potentially fatal gross contamination with pesticide.

FIGURE 12 - Aisle space to allow free air flow and access between rows of stacked pesticides
Dunnage (timber and bricks) should be used so containers are not placed directly on the floor. Stacked containers should be on pallets (Figure 13). Corrosion resulting from rising damp or leaking chemicals should be promptly observed and dealt with appropriately.

Dust, granule and wettable powder formulations should be kept in cartons during storage to avoid caking. Concentrate formulations, especially those in glass bottles, should also be kept in cartons to avoid breakage.
Storage shelves should not exceed a height of 2 m to avoid the use of ladders.
Containers should not exceed a height of 107 cm on each pallet. Containers and cartons should be stacked at safe heights ensuring that they are stable (Figure 14). The safe height depends on container material (Table 1).

Pesticide shelf-life
The biological efficacy of pesticides gradually decreases with time. The pesticide shelf-life is the period of time that a pesticide can be stored before it deteriorates. Nearly all pesticides have a limited shelf-life. As part of modern pesticide formulation technology, packing methods and storage practice aim to prolong shelf-life as much as possible. Manufacturers indicate the shelf-life of the pesticide on the container, but many pesticides may still be usable long after the indicated shelf-life has expired. Most pesticides have an indicated shelf-life of at least two years from the time of manufacture, but shelf-life will be shortened if pesticides are not stored properly (e.g. if they are stored at high temperatures). Stock turnover organization needs to take into account the time that pesticides may have been in transit between manufacture and reaching the store.
Pesticides in sealed containers may change over time in two main ways:
* The active ingredient may change chemically and break down into products that may no longer have pesticidal properties, thus decreasing the concentration of the original active ingredient.
* The formulation of the pesticide may break down and a precipitate of flakes, crystals or sludges may form, making it impossible to mix or use in sprayers.
An organochlorine such as endosulfan is chemically very stable, but some formulations may break down more rapidly. Organophosphates are much less stable and therefore generally have a shorter shelf-life. Dust and wettable powder formulations tend to break down and cake together, as a result of high temperature, high humidity, strong sunlight or compaction under pressure, more than liquids in sealed containers.
Pesticide ordering and shelf-life
The shelf-life and rate of use must be taken into account when ordering pesticides (Figure 15). Do not order more than one year's requirement. The date of manu-facture and shelf-life should be on the outside of the container. If a larger quantity is ordered than can be used during the period of shelf-life, outdated stocks will accumulate and present disposal problems, as well as financial loss.
FIGURE 15 - Storekeeper checking dates from labels on containers in a pesticide store
Stock inspection and shelf-life
Stocks in a pesticide store should be inspected regularly for signs of deterioration, such as caking of powders, sedimentation or gelling of liquids and discoloration through oxidation. Shelf-life declines rapidly after containers have been opened and left partially empty. Stock turnover must be organized to ensure that the contents of a container are used as quickly as possible once the container has been opened. Unsealed containers of dusts and wettable powders should not be kept for more than one year.
Containers are not only subject to deterioration caused by external factors (climatic, biological and mechanical), but can also be corroded internally through the action of the pesticides they contain. Emulsifiable concentrate formulations are particularly likely to affect weak spots, especially along seams (Figure 16) or where there are imperfections on the internal coating of the container. Some pesticides increase in acidity during storage and this makes them more likely to corrode containers from within. Discoloration of pesticide is a sign of corrosion of this type and should be looked for during stock inspections.
Outdated pesticide stocks
Often there is no information on shelf-life on the pesticide container label. When this is the case, a two-year shelf-life should be assumed, unless more precise information can be obtained from the manufacturer or distributor at the time of purchase.
Outdated stocks may still be usable if the formulation has not broken down. The only way that this can be verified is by having a sample of the product analysed by the manufacturer or at an independent laboratory and the dose measured accordingly. The date of the test must be attached to the drums after samples have been analysed. Trial and error methods that assess the pesticide's efficacy by using more concentrated doses or higher application rates are not recommended.
Disposal of outdated and unusable pesticides
The main aim of good storekeeping is to minimize the need to dispose of stocks since the disposal of pesticides presents many problems. However, on occasion, it will be necessary to dispose of old stock. Store accounting procedures should allow for old stocks to be written off, that is there should be some system by which unusable pesticides can be removed from the store. Unfortunately the storekeeper does not always have the authority to do this and stock tends to remain on record whether it is usable or not. If there is no system whereby pesticides can be written off and subsequently disposed of, old pesticides soon present hazards as their containers deteriorate and start to leak. The disposal of unwanted pesticides is considered later on.

Pesticide stock planning and recording systems
Pesticide stores should have a proper system of stock planning and should keep records of stocks received, held and issued. No more pesticide should be ordered than is required or than can be stored in an appropriate way. Major problems have been caused where there was no system or where the storekeeper had not been trained in, or failed to use, an existing system. Without a record system, orders for excessive quantities of pesticide can be made and the most recently received stock tends to be issued first because older stock is less accessible or the customer wants "fresh" pesticide.
As pesticides have a limited shelf-life, it is essential that only sufficient pesticide is ordered for requirements and that issues are made on a "first in -first out"basis. If such a procedure is not followed, old, out-of-date stocks of pesticide accumulate in deteriorating containers, particularly in dark recesses of the store.
Not only do these stocks represent a financial loss to the store-owner (government, marketing board, agricultural cooperative, pesticide wholesaler or retailer or individual farmer), but they also constitute a hazard to personnel working in the store and present an environmental problem when they are eventually disposed of. The movement of chemicals into and out of the store must be carefully recorded. This information may also be required for emergency services, such as the fire brigade, in the event of a disaster so that the volume of pesticides involved can be assessed.
Record systems
The record system adopted will depend on the size and function of the store and on the accounting requirements of the store-owner. Records should be kept separate from the pesticide store.
Small store
No elaborate system is required or usually possible at the minimum level of, for example, a small-scale farmer storing only a few pesticides. But even the small-scale farmer should adhere to the following practices, which are essential in all pesticide stores of whatever size:
* The date of purchase or arrival should be written on each container as it is deposited in the store.
* Ensure that all containers have proper labels and that these remain attached to the containers and are clean and readable; labels in poor condition should be replaced.
In addition, the small-scale farmer should keep invoices, delivery notes or receipts obtained in connection with pesticide purchases separate from the store. This will enable the farmer to contact the pesticide supplier in the event of an emergency or if further advice is needed. The farmer should also have a supply of material safety data sheets, which the supplier or manufacturer can provide.
Large store
Any store above the size of a small-scale farmer's will require some sort of formal records system. The system adopted depends on circumstances. Records should be kept separate from the pesticide stock so that they are not destroyed in the event of a major disaster (such as fire, flood, earthquake, hurricane or destruction during civil unrest).
Records may be kept as sheets in a ledger or in card index form. Duplicate records adjacent to the stock itself may also be required, perhaps in simplified form. Again, a supply of material safety data sheets should be requested from the supplier or manufacturer.
Records should be accurate and sufficiently detailed to enable a replacement storekeeper to take over responsibility without needing to refer to the previous storekeeper.
Pesticides have a limited shelf-life, and stock batches bought at different times may vary in formulation and packaging. It is important that a completely separate record be allocated to each consignment of different pesticides as it is received by the store.
The national authority responsible for the procurement of pesticides needs to be regularly updated on stocks kept in various locations in the country and stores should be able to supply this information.
A possible layout for a pesticide store record sheet is given below. The store record sheet allows the progress of each consignment of a particular pesticide to be followed from receipt, through inspections, stocktaking and checking to issues, analysis of stock after the shelf-life has expired and disposal when deterioration has been established.
Well-kept records are the sign of a properly run store and are essential for minimizing wastage of stock or damage caused by accidents. The store supervisor should ensure that there is an adequate system being followed by the storekeeper at all times. The storekeeper should be trained in the use of the records system and must be responsible for its upkeep.

Local transport of pesticides
Severe cases of poisoning have been caused by the transportation of pesticides with other commodities.
Containers of pesticides have leaked during movements, contaminating foodstuffs such as flour and rice packed in sacks and carried in the same truck. People have eaten the food after it has arrived at its destination and have become ill; thousands of deaths have resulted from poisoning in this way. There are several basic points to be remembered:
* Food, animal feed or general consumer goods should not be transported in the same truck as pesticides (Figure 18).
* Open or leaking containers of pesticides should never be transported.
* If pesticide containers must be transported with other goods, they must be separated in sealed partitions and securely fixed with straps or rope.
* Pesticide containers should be loaded in such a way that they will not be damaged during transport, that their labels will not be rubbed off and that they will not shift and fall off the truck on rough road surfaces (the load must be securely fixed).
* The truck driver or railway officials should be informed that the load consists of toxic pesticides and should be given instructions on what action to take in the event of an emergency (crash, fire, spillage). Material safety data sheets should be provided if possible.
* The pesticide load should be checked at intervals during transportation and any leakage, spills or other contamination should be cleaned up immediately. In the event of leakage while the means of transport is moving, the vehicle should be brought to a halt immediately to stop the leakage and the leaked product should be cleaned up.
* With a major spill, people should be kept away and the spill covered with earth, sand, etc. (Figure 19); no attempt should be made to wash away the spill with water or other substances.
* The truck, including tarpaulins and other goods, should be checked for evidence of spills or leaks after the pesticides have been unloaded, and then decontaminated of pesticide before it next departs.
* Pesticide containers should be loaded and unloaded carefully (Figure 20); most leaks from containers in storage are caused by damage during transportation and handling.
* Newly arrived consignments should be checked for leaks and loose lids, and repacked immediately if necessary. Replace torn or unreadable labels. A supply of empty new containers should be available for repacking from damaged ones.

Spills, leaks and disposal of containers and chemicals
Pesticides are biologically active materials and potentially hazardous to human health and the environment. Complete decontamination and effective disposal are often very difficult to achieve. One of the most important objectives of good store management is therefore to minimize the occurrence of leaks, spills and outdated stock.
Spills
There will occasionally be spills, even in the best run stores, especially where concentrates are repacked and transferred into other containers. Spills must be cleaned up immediately. Always have two people working when handling severe spills.
Untreated spills may corrode other containers, become trodden in and contaminate store personnel and may produce toxic or inflammable fumes. If not removed quickly, the spilled chemicals may be absorbed by the floor. Floors therefore need to be made of impermeable (sealed) concrete or other non-absorbent material - removing the contaminated part and replacing it may be the only way to decontaminate absorbent brick, earth or wooden floors.
Liquid spills
The spill should not be hosed down as this merely disperses the pesticide over a wider area.
A supply of absorbent sawdust, sand or dry soil should be kept in a container in the store.
Nitrile rubber protective gloves and face-mask should be worn.
Sawdust, sand or dry soil should be scattered over the area of the spill and left for a few minutes to soak up the chemical.
The sawdust, sand or dry soil containing absorbed spilled chemical should be swept or shovelled up and placed in a marked container for disposal (Figure 21).
FIGURE 21 - Spill soaked up by sand or sawdust being carefully swept up by the storekeeper and placed
in a container to be collected and taken for central disposal by the national authority
After sweeping, more than once if necessary, a scrubbing brush at the end of a stick should be used to scrub down the area of the spill with water and strong soap or detergent. Excess soapy water should be removed with a rough floor cloth and not hosed down.
Solid spills
Dusts, wettable powders or granules can create dust when swept up without the use of an absorbent material. A supply of absorbent sawdust, sand or dry soil should be kept in a container in the store where they can easily be reached for use in an emergency .
Nitrile rubber protective gloves and face-mask should be worn.
The sawdust, sand or dry soil should be dampened and applied with a shovel over the area of the spill.
The damp sawdust, sand or soil containing spillage material should be swept or shovelled up carefully and placed in a marked container for disposal (Figure 21).
After sweeping, more than once if necessary, a scrubbing brush at the end of a stick should be used to scrub down the area of the spill with water and strong soap or detergent. Excess soapy water should be removed with a rough floor cloth and not hosed down.
Leaks
Leakage from containers is a major problem in the storage and transport of pesticides (Figure 22). The main cause is rough handling which dents drums, weakens or splits seams and weakens closures (lids, caps and stoppers). Other causes of mechanical damage are puncturing or abrasion during transport when packages and containers rub against one another or against the sides of the truck travelling over uneven surfaces and rough roads.
FIGURE 22 - Storekeeper inspecting a leak from a pesticide container
Leaks also result from corrosion of the container, which may be accelerated by mechanical damage (dents may rupture drum linings, for example). Corrosion may start internally, the pesticide itself or its breakdown products being the primary cause. Alternatively, corrosion may begin externally, as a result of rusting in damp storage conditions or contamination from pesticide leaking from nearby containers. Many emulsifiable concentrate (ec) formulations are very corrosive. Some, including monocrotophos, dicrotophos, dichlorvos and phosphamidon are incompatible with steel, so they should be packed in plastic or aluminium containers or in steel containers lined with inner coatings. Some pesticides are dissolved in organic solvents that cannot always be packed in plastic drums.
Containers may leak for other reasons; for example, strong sunlight can degrade some plastic containers, including bottles and plastic sacks. Rodents may damage paper, board or fibre containers. Termites may attack paper and card.
Stores should be inspected regularly, at least every two months. Old, rotting and leaking containers are extremely difficult to move safely, so any leaking containers should be dealt with immediately.
Usually, the only way to deal with a leak is to repack the material in a sound container. New containers are preferable, if available, but old containers of various types and sizes may be used for this purpose (old containers are also useful for temporarily storing the products of spills). They must have been thoroughly decontaminated (see next section) and their old labels completely removed.
Pesticides should be repacked in containers made of the same materials as the original containers as some chemicals are not compatible with different materials. Ideally a drum that contained the same product should be used. If unavailable, the container must have been properly cleaned of previous contents to avoid cross-contamination. New labels must be written out immediately with all the information on the old label and fastened securely to the new container. Write the date of repacking (and the date of the original receipt) on the replacement container and ensure that the repacked material is used first.
Disposal
Disposing of pesticide containers
Many accidents have been caused by empty pesticide containers being used to store water and food. An empty pesticide container can never be cleaned completely of pesticide and should be disposed of in a way that ensures it cannot be used for other purposes. It is, however, wise to retain samples of various types of container, which have been carefully cleaned, in the pesticide store for use in repacking the contents of damaged containers and storing cleaned up leaks and spills prior to final disposal.
Empty containers awaiting disposal should be stored in a special, secure area in the pesticide store to ensure that they are not stolen and used for other purposes.
Empty containers should always be cleaned out, as far as is practicable, before disposal to minimize both hazard and waste of residual pesticide. Containers that have contained ec or wettable powder (wp) formulations should be rinsed with water several times and the rinsings added to the spray tank before it is topped up to the required volume. Following this, containers can be washed out with a mixture of water, detergent and caustic soda (Figure 23). Containers of liquid formulations may be cleaned with kerosene (paraffin) or diesel fuel and the washings (small quantities of about 5 litres) collected for sending later to a central location for disposal by the national authority in a safe and environmentally sound manner.
FIGURE 23 - Decontamination of a pesticide container - the inside and outside are being cleaned with detergent and water -
highly contaminated rinsings should be saved for disposal with other major toxic waste
As long as they are not heavily contamined paper, cardboard and fibreboard containers should be burnt on a fire in the open (Figure 24). However, cartons that have contained phenoxy acid herbicides should not be burnt because the combustion products can damage crops at long distances. Highly contaminated cardboard, paper and jute materials should be collected and sent to the central disposal centres along with other toxic waste.
FIGURE 24 - Disposal of lightly contaminated cardboard pesticide container on a fire,
ensuring that fumes travel away from personnel
Containers rendered unusable, the products of decontamination procedures, leaks and spills, and container rinsings (where these have not been added to the spray tank) should all be collected for sending later to a central location for disposal by the national authority.
Glass containers should be smashed and steel drums and metal and plastic containers punctured (Figure 25) and crushed (do not puncture aerosol containers) before being sent to a central location for disposal by the national authority.
FIGURE 25 - Metal container being crushed son that it cannot be reused -

Disposing of unwanted pesticides
Using pesticides for their intended purposes according to label instructions is the most satisfactory means of disposing of them. For this reason, no more than one year's requirement of pesticides should be ordered and stored, so that none will remain at the end of the product's shelf-life of two years. Only as much pesticide as can be used in a day's operations should be withdrawn from the store and only as much as will go into the sprayer tank should be mixed.
Occasions will arise when it will be necessary to dispose of pesticide concentrates, either because the stock is outdated and has been found to be unusable or because the product is no longer registered for the original purpose. Where very large quantities are to be disposed of, professional advice must be sought from the suppliers and national authority.
If only a few kilograms or litres of pesticide are involved, they should be collected for sending later to a central location for disposal by the national authority. Larger quantities of pesticides are best disposed of by burning in a special incinerator (at 1 200°C) - this does not mean that it would be safe to burn them at a lower temperature on a fire. Incineration requires special equipment with provision for "scrubbing" the combustion products, but this is beyond the capacity of pesticide storekeepers and should be referred to the relevant national authority.
Other means of disposal are to return the pesticide to the supplier or pass it on to a specialist disposal agent elected by the national authority.
Returning the pesticide to the supplier or to the national authority is the safest means of disposal. Disposal involves chemical methods such as alkaline and acid hydrolysis. Oxidation, reduction and spraying on to the ground or allowing to escape into the atmosphere may also be employed, but require specialist skills. The end product in most cases is still toxic. Storekeepers should not become directly involved with pesticide disposal and should refer to the relevant national authority.

Decontamination
Personnel
Pesticides coming into contact with the skin can rapidly enter the body. Successful decontamination of body surfaces requires:
* prompt action and rapid application of plenty of soap and water;
* extremely thorough washing.
Anyone contaminated with pesticide should strip off their clothing and quickly and thoroughly scrub the affected part of their body with soap and water. This should be followed by careful rinsing and towelling dry (Figure 26).
FIGURE 26 - Storekeeper decontaminating himself by washing thoroughly with soap and water -

Protective clothing
Contaminated protective clothing should be thoroughly washed using industrial grade detergent followed by several rinsings. Protective clothing should not be washed with the family wash. Gloves should be worn when washing protective clothing. Hot water should be used when available. Washed clothes should be hung to dry in full sunshine.
Where there is a large patch of fabric that has been contaminated by toxic concentrates and replacement clothing is available, it is best to destroy the affected clothing by burning.
Stores and vehicles
When dealing with leaks and spills, water, soap or detergent are usually the most readily available materials for decontamination. However, other chemicals sold for domestic or common commercial purposes may be useful too.
Organophosphorus compounds can be treated by sodium hypochlorite (bleach) and sodium carbonate (washing soda), which are useful for decontamination and can be applied following initial scrubbing with soap and water.
Organochlorine compounds are persistent chemicals and household ammonia and washing soda can be used, but the main method is to scrub with water and detergent.
Carbamates should be scrubbed with washing soda or strong soap.
Transport vehicles should be decontaminated thoroughly as soon as spills or leaks are seen, otherwise there is a danger that when used subsequently for other goods, including foodstuffs, the goods could become contaminated (Figure 27). Spills are cleaned up in the same way that they are in stores. The contaminated washings from the vehicle should be absorbed by sawdust, sand or dry soil and placed in a container for collection and central disposal by the national authority.

Major emergencies
Major emergencies are a far greater risk for pesticide stores than they are elsewhere.
Fire
The primary objective in the design and management of pesticide stores is to reduce the risk of fire. Prevention is better than cure!
Pesticides, especially those formulated as liquids, present major fire hazards because the solvents used in formulations (oils and petroleum distillates) have low flashpoints and may be readily vaporized at normal temperatures. In poorly ventilated stores heavy vapours may accumulate near the floor if drums are left open or if leaks and spills are not cleared up. An electrical spark, naked flame or even the sun's rays concentrated by a glass container may cause an explosion followed by the spread of fire.
Some wettable powders are suspected of starting fires through spontaneous combustion, while sodium chlorate (used as a herbicide, defoliant, desiccant and soil sterilant) is a powerful oxidizing agent that easily catches fire and should only be supplied with a fire suppressant in the formulation (once sodium chlorate containers have been opened their entire
