Introduction: In recent years, there have been heightened concerns about food safety, not only amongst scientists with an interest in food toxicology or microbiology, for example, but also economists and other social scientists that focus on the wider socio-economic issues associated with the safety of a country's food supply. In part this reflects the real incidence of food-borne illnesses world-wide, and in part consumer concerns about the safety of the food they consume, particularly in industrialised countries, often fuelled by media attention. An added dimension is the impact of food safety regulations on global trade in agricultural and food products. In some ways there is a stark contrast between industrialised and developing countries, although in both contexts the incidence of foodborne diseases (in particular those associated with microbial pathogens) is acknowledged to be considerable. Whilst this paper will highlight these differences and similarities, its primary focus is on the economics of food safety, specifically in a developing country context. In industrialised countries, whilst food supplies are generally considered to be safe, evidence suggests that food-borne illnesses are prevalent and that the incidence of certain food-borne pathogens is increasing. For example, more than 40 different food-borne pathogens are known to cause human illness (Buzby et al., 2001). Significant incidents of contaminated meat, dairy products, salads and canned goods, although relatively infrequent, send signals to consumers that the food they purchase is not risk-free. In many cases only small groups of consumers are directly affected by the events, yet publicized food scares create an environment, through a process of `social amplification', in which food safety is an increasingly widespread and pressing concern. Whilst it is recognised that the prevelance of food-borne illness in developing countries is considerable, in most there is limited data through which the incidence of particular diseases and trends over time can be assessed. In many cases, high rates of food-borne illness are associated with low levels of general economic development and, more specifically, limited capacity to control the safety of the food supply. Further, there are close inter-relationships between food safety issues and other elements of environmental health, for example sanitation, water quality and housing conditions.
This paper aims to provide an overview of issues associated with the economics of food safety in developing countries. By necessity, many of these issues are not explored in the depth they deserve. However, it intends to highlight the major questions and concerns associated with an economic analysis of food safety issues, both generally and specifically in a developing country context. Thus, it provides an overview of these issues and highlights key references for readers that wish to explore these issues in greater depth. The paper starts by discussing in very basic details what is meant by food safety, highlighting the main hazards potentially associated with food. The burden imposed on developing countries is then assessed, both in terms of rates of human morbidity and premature mortality and the economic and social costs imposed on developing societies. In so doing, the paucity of data on the magnitude of food-borne illness in developing countries is highlighted. The ways in which markets may fail to provide for an appropriate level of food safety, and thus the case for government regulation, are then discussed. Much of the remainder of the paper then explores the key elements of food safety capacity and analyses attempts by developing country governments to enhance their capacity in strategic areas in some depth. It concludes by suggesting positive ways forward through which the capacity of developing countries to manage food safety, both for the protection of their domestic populations and promotion of trade in agricultural and food products, can be enhanced.
What is food safety? Food safety refers to the potential hazards associated with food that can cause ill-health in humans. Certain of these hazards are naturally-occurring (for example aflatoxins in groundnuts), whilst others occur through contamination (for example pesticide residues in fruit). The potential hazards associated with food include the following (Unnevehr and Hirschhorn, 2000; WHO, 2002a): · Microbial pathogens are micro-organisms that occur naturally in humans, animals and/or the environment. Examples include Salmonella, Campylobacter and E. coli. Microbial pathogens are associated with diarrhoeal diseases. · Zoonotic diseases are transmitted from animals to humans through food products, for example tuberculosis and brucellosis.
Parasitic organisms, in particular intestinal worms, can be transmitted through contaminated food and water.
Physical contaminants and adulterants can occur in food through normal modes of contamination or deliberate addition. Examples include glass, metal animal faeces etc.
Naturally-occurring toxicants occur in food naturally or enter through normal biological processes. Many are virulent toxins associated with enhanced risk of chronic disease in humans and in certain cases acute ill-health. Examples include mycotoxins, alkaloids, lectins etc.
Agro-chemical and veterinary drug residues can occur in food as a result of the purposeful use of these substances in agricultural production. cancer. Residues of some substances, for example pesticides, are associated with an elevated risk of.

Heavy metals such as lead and mercury cause neurological damage in infants and children. Exposure to cadmium can also cause kidney damage, usually seen.
in the elderly. These can contaminate food through pollution of air, water and soil. · Genetically-modified organisms may contain allergens or toxins that are not found in conventional foods. Some of these hazards cause acute illness, for example microbial pathogens. Others may increase the risk of chronic diseases such as cancer, for example pesticide residues. Across all of these hazards, the impact on an individual reflects a range of factors including age, prevailing health status, genetic constitution etc. Perhaps of greatest interest in a developing country context is food-borne illness associated with microbial pathogens. The recorded incidence of food-borne illness is increasing world-wide for a variety of reasons including changes in eating patterns and food production and handling practices, the enhanced geographical movement of people, animals and plants, and emergence of new pathogenic organisms. Further, whilst less well documented, it is evident that the incidence of food-borne disease is greatest in developing countries due to the presence of a wide range of pathogens. Indeed, the high prevalence of diarrhoeal diseases in many developing countries suggests major underlying food safety problems. Whilst the entire range of potential food-borne hazards are of concern world-wide, relative risk and perceived importance differs according to a range of factors including levels of economic development, climatic conditions, cultural and social norms, prevailing infrastructure etc. Thus, certain risks are greater in developing countries, for example because of poor sanitation and/or inadequate access to potable water (Unnevehr and Hirschhorn, 2000). For example, Cholera is a public health problem particular to developing countries that is the cause of significant levels of human morbidity and mortality and enormous economic losses. The disease is caused by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. In addition to water, contaminated foods can be a major vehicle of infection. Different foods, including rice, vegetables, millet gruel and various types of seafood have been implicated in outbreaks of cholera. Likewise, mycotoxins are more prevalent in tropical and sub-tropical countries (Bhat and Vasanthi, 1999), as are certain parasites.
Food safety is a composite element of the wider concept of `biosecurity' which the FAO Committee on Agriculture has defined as (FAO, 2002): "Biosecurity encompasses all policy and regulatory frameworks (including instruments and activities) to manage risks associated with food and agriculture (including relevant environmental risks). Biosecurity is composed of three sectors, namely food safety, plant life and health, and animal life and health. These sectors include food production in relation to food safety, the introduction of plants pests, animal pests and diseases, and zoonoses, the introduction and release of genetically-modified organisms (GMOs) and their products, and the introduction and safe management of invasive alien species and genotypes." "Biosecurity thus has direct relevance to food safety, the conservation of the environment (including biodiversity), and sustainability of agriculture." This emphasises the similarities and complementarities between the control measures demanded by risks to food safety, plant and animal health. Further, certain hazards cut across these distinctions, for example the cattle diseases BSE and Tuberculosis are also associated with potentially significant food safety risks for humans. Food safety is of particular concern in a developing country context not only because of the high prevalence of food-borne illness and other hazards associated with food, but also because of the considerable economic and social costs that, in turn, reflect prevailing levels of economic development. Thus, for example, a child that contracts diarrhoea from consuming contaminated food may not be able to gain access to the required medical care and may suffer more adverse consequences as a result. Further, the considerable and rapid economic and social changes associated with processes of development, for example urbanisation, changes in systems of food production and shifts in food consumption patterns can enhance risks and/or challenge prevailing systems of control.
This emphasises the need to consider food safety within the wider context, for example as provided by the ecosystem approach to human health. This recognises the connections between disease and socio-economic factors such as poverty and malnutrition and the wider economic, social, physical and cultural environment in which people live (Forget and Lebel, 2001). For example, Figure 1 demonstrates the interrelationships that determine the incidence of common diseases in rural Ethiopia (Lebel, 2003). Further, it emphasises that effective strategies to address food safety issues, particularly within a developing country context, require a holistic approach to be adopted that not only considers the risks associated with a particular food but the wider context in which they occur and the constraints on efforts for their control. The importance of food safety as a global public health concern has been recognised internationally. For example, the Rome Declaration on World Food Security (1996) clearly stated that all people have the right to safe food whatever the level of their effective demand. At the international level, the promotion of food safety is the joint responsibility of both FAO and WHO. Food safety has long been a main-stream activity of FAO, including technical assistance program aimed at enhancing food safety control capacity. In the case of WHO, the 53rd World Health assembly requested that the Director-General give greater emphasis to food safety and establish a global strategy for surveillance of food-borne diseases and to initiate a range of other activities on food safety and health (WHO, 2000a; 2002b).
The burden of food-borne illness in developing countries: Whilst the global incidence of food-borne disease is difficult to estimate, it is possible to sketch a general picture by way of introduction from the various and widespread information that is available. In the early 1990s, there were approximately 1.5 billion episodes of diarrhoea annually (Motarjemi et al., 1993), of which around 70 percent were associated with contaminated food. Further, it is estimated that 2.1 million people died from diarrhoeal diseases in 2000 (WHO, 2000a). In industrialized countries, for which more data are available, the percentage of people suffering from food-borne diseases each year has been reported to be up to 30 percent. In the United States, for example,.

around 76 million cases of food-borne diseases are estimated to occur each year (Mead et al., 1999). While most food-borne diseases are sporadic and often not reported, outbreaks can take on massive proportions. For example, in 1988 an outbreak of hepatitis A, resulting from the consumption of contaminated clams, affected some 300,000 individuals in China. Data collected by surveillance systems are far from exhaustive and much of our understating of the epidemiology of food-borne diarrhoea has been derived from investigations of outbreaks. Data on sporadic cases is largely derived through passive surveillance systems, the quality of which varies greatly by country and disease. In addition, under-reporting of diarrhoea regarding both sporadic and outbreak cases is significant but varies by country. As a result, data on the incidence of food-borne illness in both industrialised and developing countries are very incomplete and under-state the extent of the problem. Data for developing countries are particularly weak, although it is recognised that a wide range of bacterial infections and intoxications are widespread (Table 1). Further, where incidence data are available, these are frequently out-dated. Some indicative examples are provided below. Table.

There is little in the way of regular surveillance of food-borne disease in Africa, although there is awareness of the importance of diarrhoeal disease and a limited number of studies have been undertaken (Todd, 1997). For example, a survey of hygiene in households where diarrhoea had occurred was undertaken in Liberia by Molbak et al. (1989). This indicated that 40 to 80 percent of stored water samples and 19 to 32 percent of food samples contained significant numbers of enterobacteria. Levels of contamination were even greater in infant foods that were generally stored at room temperature. However, a case control study by Ekanem et al. (1991) suggests that diarrhoea in Liberian households was more related to improper disposal of faeces than poor food hygiene. Occasionally, acute illnesses that are directly associated with a food are documented in African countries. For example, in 1992, a large outbreak of bloody diarrhoea caused by E. coli 0157 occurred in Swaziland. This was the first recorded outbreak of E. coli 0157 in Africa, and indeed in a developing country (Effler et al., 2001). Over the period October to November 1992 there were 40,912 physician visits for diarrhoea in persons aged five years or older, 700% greater than in the same months during 1990-91. The outbreak was associated with consumption of beef and untreated water and more widespread amongst women. Droughts, carriage of E. coli 0157 by cattle and heavy rains with contamination of surface water were important factors contributing to the outbreak. Similarly, an outbreak of E. coli 0157 in Egypt during 1994 resulted in the death of three children and severe diarrhoea in six others. This resulted from consumption of contaminated A follow-up survey of 175 foods from hamburgers, koshari and dairy products.
slaughterhouses, supermarkets and farmers' homes detected E. coli 0157 in six percent of unpasteurised milk, six percent of fresh retail beef, four percent of boneless chicken, and four percent of lamb meat samples. Likewise, little surveillance of food-borne disease is routinely undertaken in Asia. Most information is derived from specific but limited investigations and studies (Todd, 1997). For example, in Vietnam, it is estimated that 30 to 57 percent of students in university hostels in Hanoi suffered from diarrhoea over the period 1984-88, mainly because food was poorly prepared and/or stored. Over the period 1983-88, 5,714 illnesses were documented, most associated with Salmonella, E. coli or S. aureus. Of these cases, 156 died.
In Thailand, there has been a particular focus on chemical poisonings, especially from insecticides, although these only accounted for 0.33 percent of the reported 207,580 cases of food-borne diseases over the period 1981-86 (Swaddiwuthipong et al., 1988). Because of the widespread use of insecticides, some have accidentally contaminated desserts, beverages, fruit and other foods. Indeed, over the period 1981-87 insecticides accounted for 27.4 percent of food-borne disease outbreaks. Over the period 1984-89, there were 721 food-borne outbreaks and 1,199 sporadic cases of food-borne disease were recorded in the cities of Hyderabad and Secunderabad, India (Shekhar et al., 1992). The main vehicles of infection were `stale' food, rice dishes, sweets and curry. `Stale' food was most generally left over from a previous meal and stored at room temperature, usually overnight (Rao, 1989). In Pakistan, sweet dishes have been found to be a major vehicle for S. aureus intoxication (Teufel et al., 1992). In one outbreak, eight people were hospitalised after consuming khoa, a confection made from buffalo milk. Some samples of khoa obtained from manufacturers in a large city contained appreciable levels of S.aureus. Salmonella has also been found in khoa and cheese-based confectionery. Pulses, ground meat dishes and chick peas vended at bus and train stations in the same city contained high levels of C. perfringens when held at an inadequate temperature (Bryan et al., 1992a). Home-prepared foods in small communities also contained pathogens such as S.aureus, C. perfringen and B. cereus (Bryan et al., 1992b). All countries in Latin America and the Caribbean have some form of notifiable disease system (See for example Table 2) (Todd, 1997). For example, diarrhoeal diseases account for 967 deaths per 100,000 of the population amongst children aged less than one year in Nicaragua. This compares with an incidence of 0.5 deaths per 100,000 of the population in Canada (PAHO, 1990). Typically, four to seven bouts of diarrhoea are experienced each year by children aged less than five years. In Argentina, Salmonella enteritidis (Eiguer et al., 1990) and E.coli 0157 (Lopez et al., 1992) have been recorded as responsible for significant rates of food-borne illness. Between 1986 and 1990, there were 35 outbreaks of S. enteritidis affecting 3,500 people, largely through consumption of insufficiently cooked poultry or eggs used in mayonnaise. In.
the province of Buenos Aires, S. enteritidis caused 23 percent of outbreaks, 44 percent were related to other bacteria and 27 percent to chemicals, whilst six percent were of unknown cause. In 1991, V. cholera was found throughout Peru in water, sewage, finfish, molluscs and plankton (Tamplin and Pardodi, 1991). The disease was spread partly through consumption of street-vended foods and beverages containing ice (Ries et al., 1992) and also undercooked or raw seafood (Finelli et al., 1992). A broader group of studies has examined levels of microbiological and/or chemical contamination of foods in developing countries without any attempt to relate to human disease. A major focus of much of this literature has been street foods and the products of the informal sector. For example, Gran et al. (2002a; 200b; 2003) investigate the occurrence of pathogenic bacteria in raw milk and fermented milk products in Zimbabwe. In certain cases high levels of contamination are identified that pose a significant health hazard to consumers. Bonfoh et al. (2003) present a similar study on the microbiological quality of milk in Bamako, Mali. Other recent studies, for example, examine levels of aflatoxin B1 in milk in Argentina (Lopez et al., 2003), Salmonella in raw vegetables in Malaysia (Salleh et al., 2003) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in fruit and vegetable in Brazil (Camargo and Toledo, 2003). In an attempt to bridge gaps in the available data, the WHO has developed a new approach to estimate the incidence of food-borne diarrhoea using a risk assessmentbased approach (WHO, 2002c). This approach uses the estimated annual incidence of food-borne non-typhi and paratyphi Salmonella as an indicator of the overall incidence of food-borne diarrhoea. incidence. For example, Tables 3 to 6 present the estimated incidence of food-borne salmonellosis in India, Egypt, Brazil and Zimbabwe. Eggs are the predominant vehicle of infection, accounting for more than 50 percent of cases in India, Egypt and Brazil. Poultry and fish and seafood are major vehicles in Zimbabwe and India respectively, reflecting local food Further, it employs the transfer rate (TR) risk assessment approach based on the link between exposure to a micro-organism in food and a disease.

Table 7 reports the estimated incidence rate for food-borne salmonellosis in a number of developing countries. Estimates range from 79.2 per 1,000 of the population in Thailand to 5.4 per 1,000 of the population in Ethiopia and India. However, there is considerable uncertainty associated with estimates for individual countries (as seen by the range around the mean) reflecting the paucity of existing incidence data and the assumptions associated with the estimation method. Further, differences in estimated incidence across these countries highlight the dangers of extrapolating the results from one geographical context to another and/or over-generalising to developing countries as a whole.

The United States probably has the most detailed data on the incidence of food-borne illness and, whilst recognising the problems of extrapolating to the wider context as discussed above, these can provide a more detailed picture of human illness associated with food. For example, Mead et al. (1999) estimate that food-borne disease causes approximately 76 million illnesses, 325,000 hospitalisations and 5,000 deaths each year. Of these, known pathogens account for an estimated 14 million illnesses, 60,000 hospitalisations and 1,800 deaths. Three pathogens ­ Salmonella, Listeria and Toxoplasma ­ account for 1,500 deaths each year accounting for 75 percent of fatalities from known pathogens.

The Economic Research Service (ERS) of the US Department of Agriculture publishes detailed data on the incidence of food-borne illness in the United States (Table 8). It is estimated that 38.6 million cases of illness were associated with known food-borne pathogens in 1996. Of these, 23 million were associated with Norwalk-type viruses, 40 percent of which were transmitted by food.

Whilst there is a paucity of data on the incidence of food-borne illness in developing countries, there is even less information available on the associated burden in terms of human ill-health. One summary measure of the losses associated with premature mortality and morbidity associated with human disease is the Disability Adjusted Life Year (DALY). For any condition i: DALYi = YLLi + YLDi Where: DALYi = Loss of disability-adjusted life years associated with condition i. YLLi = Years of life lost associated with condition i. 1.22 26.83 11.45 22.12 66.00 39.64 3.26 12.02 32.11 8.39 Mean 5.36 33.75 19.00 26.88 79.20 48.45 5.44 20.72 36.89 10.11 Maximum 10.73 40.78 28.82 32.18 95.00 58.56 8.41 32.29 41.67 12.15.
YLDi = Years lived with disability associated with condition i. The YLL is a measure of the loss of life due to premature mortality, calculated using standard expected years of life lost and an appropriate discount factor. The YLD is time lived in health states worse than perfect health, weighted by a preference factor for each health state. Time lived with disability is also age-weighted and discounted in the same manner as YLLs. It is estimated that 99.6 million DALYs were lost world-wide due to diarrhoeal disease in 1990, accounting for 7.3 percent of the loss from all causes (Table 9). Of the total loss due to diarrhoeal disease, 32 percent was in Sub-Saharan Africa and 30 percent in India. In these regions, diarrhoeal disease accounted for between ten and 11 percent of the loss from all causes. There have been very few studies of the economic costs associated with food-borne illness in developing countries, although detailed data are available for a number of industrialised countries, most notably the United States. One exception is Sudhakar et al., (1988) which provides an analysis of an outbreak of S. aureus in India during the 1980s. Overall, 41 percent of the associated costs were borne by the affected individuals including loss of wages or productivity losses and other expenses. The economic burden on the affected people was estimated to be greater, as a percentage of per capita income, than in similar outbreaks in the United States. The ERS also publish detailed estimates of the economic costs associated with foodborne illness in the United States (Table 10). These provide some indication of the magnitude of costs associated with food-borne illness that might be found in a developing country context. The estimated medical costs, productivity losses and value of premature deaths due to diseases caused by five food-borne pathogens (Campylobacter, non-typhi Salmonella, E. coli O157, E. coli non-O157 STEC and Listeria monocytogenes) in 2000 are $6.9 billion per year (Table 10). The assumed cost of each death ranges from $8.9 million for children who die before their first birthday to $1.7 million for individual
