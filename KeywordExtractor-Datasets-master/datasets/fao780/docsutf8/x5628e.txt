This tilapia is the most resistant to -saline conditions of the three plant eating species. Introductions have only been reported from the U.S.S.R. where the present status of the species is doubtful.

Tilapia mariae BOULENGER: CICHLIDAE
Native ranges Coastal rivers of West Africa
The spotted tilapia is a sometimes used as an ornamental - species and escapes from aquariums accounted for the colonization of some of the warmer waters in the 0.5. There the species has proved extremely aggressive and it is spreading rapidly. 'Other introductions have not resulted in self-propagating populations becoming established under natural conditions.

Tilapia rendalli BOULEHGERI CICHLIDAE
Native range: West and Central Africa Tilapia rendalli and T. zillii are virtually indistinguishable in appearance and habit and are frequently confused in describing introductions and present distribution. The Situation is further confused where both species are present together because they appear to hybridize freely. Both species eat higher plants, at least to some extent, and have been widely introduced for weed control and for aquaculture. Many populations have become established in the wild and the fish evokes mixed reactions in that some areas it is popular end the foundation of local fisheries whereas in others it is regarded as a nuisance.

Tinca tinca L. CYPRINIDAE
Native range: Europe except North Scandinavia, Western Asia
The tench is essentially a species of cool, slow flowing, eutrophicated waters. It is used for food in parts of Europe and some attempts have been made to culture the species. It was a popular fish for introductions in the earlier years of this century although in retrospect the rationale for such movements is doubtful. The tench colonized waters in Southern Australia and New Zealand with considerable success and isolated populations of the species still persist elsewhere in the world.

The moonlight gourami is similar in appearance to T. leeri but is somewhat larger. It too is a popular warm water aquarium species. It is a popular food fish in its native Thailand where because of its resistance to oxygen deficient conditions it can be kept alive in damp moss for some time before marketing. The species has appeared in Colombia, presumably because of escapes from aquarium rearing facilities.

The eastern mudminnow is very similar in appearance and habit to U. krameri and like that species is resistant to deoxygenated conditions. The species is of no commercial value although it is kept in cold water aquariums. It was introduced for some unknown purpose into the canal systems of North Western Europe (possibly in France as the earliest record of the species are from there), and has spread by diffusion throughout the area from France to Germany. An independent population exists in central France.

Xiphophorus helleri HECKEL: POECILIIDAE
Native range: Southeastern Mexico and Guatemala
The swordtail is one of the most popular tropical aquarium species with many varieties, the species has been transported around the world and reared both in aquariums and in farms. The swordtail has achieved a fairly wide distribution through escape or deliberate release from aquariums and is probably even more extensively established than records show. The species is insectivorous and thus its presence in small waterways may be beneficial.

Like the swordtail the platy is a common and popular aquarium species. It has achieved a near global distribution through dissemination by the aquarium fish trade and escapees from aquariums have established populations in many tropical areas. Its actual distribution is likely to be considerably wider than reports would indicate, the species is insectivorous and may play a role in mosquito control where present.

The variegated platy is similar to X. maculatus in that it is a comnon and popular aquarium species. It has also achieved near global distribution through dissemination by the aquarium fish trade and escapees from aquariums have established populations in some tropical areas. The species is insectivorous and has been suggested as a candidate for introduction for mosquito control.
