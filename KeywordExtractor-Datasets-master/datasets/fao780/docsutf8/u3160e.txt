<title>Water harvesting (AGL/MISC/17/91)</title>
<section>1</section>
Preface
This manual has been written with the intention of providing technicians and extension workers with practical guidelines on the implementation of water harvesting schemes. However it will also be of interest to a wider audience, such as rural development specialists and planners.
The focus of the manual is on simple, field scale systems for improved production of crops, trees and rangeland species in drought prone areas. Water harvesting systems for water supply such as haffirs, ponds and rooftop tanks are not covered in this manual, nor are large-scale water spreading systems (spate irrigation).
Most of the systems outlined and experiences described are drawn from Sub-Saharan Africa. Nevertheless, the manual is also relevant to arid and semi-arid areas in other parts of the world where the basic problems - low and erratic rainfall, high rates of runoff, and unreliable food production are similar.
The manual provides the field worker with selection criteria and detailed technical designs for the various systems, as well as information on field layout and construction. This is the main part of the document - but the full range of information given is much wider.
Throughout, there has been an effort to keep the manual a practical working document, using tables, diagrams, charts and photographs as much as possible in place of text. It is hoped that the manual will serve as a useful field guide for the implementation of water harvesting schemes.

As land pressure rises, more and more marginal areas in the world are being used for agriculture. Much of this land is located in the arid or semi-arid belts where rain falls irregularly and much of the precious water is soon lost as surface runoff. Recent droughts have highlighted the risks to human beings and livestock, which occur when rains falter or fail.
While irrigation may be the most obvious response to drought, it has proved costly and can only benefit a fortunate few. There is now increasing interest in a low cost alternative - generally referred to as "water harvesting".
Water harvesting is the collection of runoff for productive purposes. Instead of runoff being left to cause erosion, it is harvested and utilized. In the semi-arid drought-prone areas where it is already practised, water harvesting is a directly productive form of soil and water conservation. Both yields and reliability of production can be significantly improved with this method.
Water harvesting (WH) can be considered as a rudimentary form of irrigation. The difference is that with WH the farmer (or more usually, the agro-pastoralist) has no control over timing. Runoff can only be harvested when it rains. In regions where crops are entirely rainfed, a reduction of 50% in the seasonal rainfall, for example, may result in a total crop failure. If, however, the available rain can be concentrated on a smaller area, reasonable yields will still be received. Of course in a year of severe drought there may be no runoff to collect, but an efficient water harvesting system will improve plant growth in the majority of years.
Figure 1 The principle of water harvesting
1.1.1 Historical perspectives
Various forms of water harvesting (WH) have been used traditionally throughout the centuries. Some of the very earliest agriculture, in the Middle East, was based on techniques such as diversion of "wadi" flow (spate flow from normally dry watercourses) onto agricultural fields. In the Negev Desert of Israel, WH systems dating back 4000 years or more have been discovered (Evanari et al. 1971). These schemes involved the clearing of hillsides from vegetation to increase runoff, which was then directed to fields on the plains.
Floodwater farming has been practised in the desert areas of Arizona and northwest New Mexico for at least the last 1000 years (Zaunderer and Hutchinson 1988). The Hopi Indians on the Colorado Plateau, cultivate fields situated at the mouth of ephemeral streams. Where the streams fan out, these fields are called "Akchin". Pacey and Cullis (1986) describe microcatchment techniques for tree growing, used in southern Tunisia, which were discovered in the nineteenth century by travelers. In the "Khadin" system of India, floodwater is impounded behind earth bunds, and crops then planted into the residual moisture when the water infiltrates.
The importance of traditional, small scale systems of WH in Sub-Saharan Africa is just beginning to be recognized (Critchley and Reij 1989). Simple stone lines are used, for example, in some West African countries, notably Burkina Faso, and earth bunding systems are found in Eastern Sudan and the Central Rangelands of Somalia.
1.1.2 Recent developments
A growing awareness of the potential of water harvesting for improved crop production arose in the 1970s and 1980s, with the widespread droughts in Africa leaving a trail of crop failures. The stimulus was the well-documented work on WH in the Negev Desert of Israel (Evanari et al. 1971).
However much of the experience with WH gained in countries such as Israel, USA and Australia has limited relevance to resource-poor areas in the semi-arid regions of Africa and Asia. In Israel, research emphasis is on the hydrological aspects of microcatchments for fruit trees such as almonds and pistachio nuts. In the USA and Australia WH techniques are mainly applied for domestic and livestock water supply, and research is directed towards improving runoff yields from treated catchment surfaces.
A number of WH projects have been set up in Sub-Saharan Africa during the past decade. Their objectives have been to combat the effects of drought by improving plant production (usually annual food crops), and in certain areas rehabilitating abandoned and degraded land (Critchley and Reij 1989). However few of the projects have succeeded in combining technical efficiency with low cost and acceptability to the local farmers or agropastoralists. This is partially due to the lack of technical "know how" but also often due to the selection of an inappropriate approach with regard to the prevailing socio-economic conditions.
1.1.3 Future directions
Appropriate systems should ideally evolve from the experience of traditional techniques - where these exist. They should also be based on lessons learned from the shortcomings of previous projects. Above all it is necessary that the systems are appreciated by the communities where they are introduced. Without popular participation and support, projects are unlikely to succeed.
Water harvesting technology is especially relevant to the semi-arid and arid areas where the problems of environmental degradation, drought and population pressures are most evident. It is an important component of the package of remedies for these problem zones, and there is no doubt that implementation of WH techniques will expand.
Figure 2 Classification of water harvesting techniques
Notes:
* Water supply systems (i.e. ponded water) used for a variety of purposes, mainly domestic and stock water but also some supplementary irrigation.
** The term "farming" (as in "Runoff Farming") is used in its broadest sense - to include trees, agroforestry, rangeland rehabilitation, etc.
1.2 Definitions and classification
Water harvesting in its broadest sense will be defined as the
"collection of runoff for its productive use".
Runoff may be harvested from roofs and ground surfaces as well as from intermittent or ephemeral watercourses.
Water harvesting techniques which harvest runoff from roofs or ground surfaces fall under the term:
RAINWATER HARVESTING
while all systems which collect discharges from watercourses are grouped under the term:
FLOODWATER HARVESTING
A wide variety of water harvesting techniques for many different applications are known. Productive uses include provision of domestic and stock water, concentration of runoff for crops, fodder and tree production and less frequently water supply for fish and duck ponds.
In the context of this manual, the end use is plant production, including fodder and trees.
Classification of water harvesting techniques is as varied as the terminology (Reij et al. 1988). Different authors use different names and often disagree about definitions.
It is not the intention of this manual to introduce new terms but instead it was considered appropriate to make use of the terminology which has been established within the context of the "Sub-Saharan Water Harvesting Study," undertaken by the World Bank in 1986-1989. The general and practical classification is presented in Figure 2.
1.3 Basic categories of water harvesting systems for plant production
1.3.1 Microcatchments (rainwater harvesting)
1.3.2 External catchment systems (rainwater harvesting)
1.3.3 Floodwater farming (floodwater harvesting)
The water harvesting techniques described in this manual fall under three basic categories whose main characteristics are summarized as follows:

1.4 Overview of main WH systems
An overview of the main Water Harvesting systems which are described in detail in Section 5 is given in Table 1. This summary will be useful as a quick reference.
The eight techniques presented and explained in the manual are not the only water harvesting systems known but they do represent the major range of techniques for different situations and productive uses. In a number of cases, the system which is described here is the most typical example of a technique for which a number of variations exist - trapezoidal bunds are a case in point.

2.1.1 Introduction
For the design of water harvesting systems, it is necessary to assess the water requirement of the crop intended to be grown.
There have been various methods developed to determine the water requirement for specific plants. An excellent guide to the details of these calculations and different methods is the FAO Irrigation and Drainage Paper 24 "Crop Water Requirements". It should however be noted that formulae which give high accuracy also require a high accuracy of measured input data which in most places where water harvesting is practised will not be available.
2.1.2 General estimates
In the absence of any measured climatic data, it is often adequate to use estimates of water requirements for common crops (Table 2). However, for a better understanding of the various factors and their interrelationship which influences the water demand of a specific plant, the following has been drawn from the FAO Irrigation Water Management Training Manual No. 3.

2.1.3 Factors influencing crop water requirements
i. Influence of climate
A certain crop grown in a sunny and hot climate needs more water per day than the same crop grown in a cloudy and cooler climate. There are, however, apart from sunshine and temperature, other climatic factors which influence the crop water need. These factors are humidity and wind speed. When it is dry, the crop water needs are higher than when it is humid. In windy climates, the crops will use more water than in calm climates.
The highest crop water needs are thus found in areas which are hot, dry, windy and sunny. The lowest values are found when it is cool, humid and cloudy with little or no wind.
From the above, it is clear that the crop grown in different climatic zones will have different water needs. For example, a certain maize variety grown in a cool climate will need less water per day than the same maize variety grown in a hotter climate.
Plate 1 - Wilted maize crop
Plate 2 Good maize crop
It is therefore useful to take a certain standard crop or reference crop and determine how much water this crop needs per day in the various climatic regions. As a standard crop (or reference crop) grass has been chosen.
Table 4 indicates the average daily water needs of this reference grass crop. The daily water needs of the grass depend on the climatic zone (rainfall regime) and daily temperatures.

For the various field crops it is possible to determine how much water they need compared to the standard grass. A number of crops need less water than grass, a number of crops need more water than grass and other crops need more or less the same amount of water as grass. Understanding of this relationship is extremely important for the selection of crops to be grown in a water harvesting scheme (see Chapter 6, Crop Husbandry).

ii. Influence of crop type on crop water needs
The influence of the crop type on the crop water need is important in two ways.
a. The crop type has an influence on the daily water needs of a fully grown crop; i.e. the peak daily water needs of a fully developed maize crop will need more water per day than a fully developed crop of onions.
b. The crop type has an influence on the duration of the total growing season of the crop. There are short duration crops, e.g. peas, with a duration of the total growing season of 90-100 days and longer duration crops, e.g. melons, with a duration of the total growing season of 120-160 days. There are, of course, also perennial crops that are in the field for many years, such as fruit trees.
While, for example, the daily water need of melons may be less than the daily water need of beans, the seasonal water need of melons will be higher than that of beans because the duration of the total growing season of melons is much longer.
Data on the duration of the total growing season of the various crops grown in an area can best be obtained locally. These data may be obtained from, for example, the seed supplier, the Extension Service, the Irrigation Department or Ministry of Agriculture.
Table 6 gives some indicative values or approximate values for the duration of the total growing season for the various field crops. It should, however, be noted that the values are only rough approximations and it is much better to obtain the values locally.

From Table 6, it is obvious that there is a large variation of values not only between crops, but also within one crop type. In general, it can be assumed that the growing period for a certain crop is longer when the climate is cool and shorter when the climate is warm.
Crops differ in their response to moisture deficit. This characteristic is commonly termed "drought resistance" (Table 7 summarizes sensitivity to drought). When crop water requirements are not met, crops with a high drought sensitivity suffer greater reductions in yields than crops with a low sensitivity.

2.1.4 Calculation of crop water requirements
i. Introduction
The calculation of crop water requirements by means of the two methods described in this section is relatively simple. The basic formula for the calculation reads as follows:
ETcrop = kc x Eto
where:
ETcrop = the water requirement of a given crop in mm per unit of time e.g. mm/day, mm/month or mm/season.
kc = the "crop factor"
ETo = the "reference crop evapotranspiration" in mm per unit of time e.g. mm/day, mm/month or mm/season.
ii. ETo - reference crop evapotranspiration
The reference crop evapotranspiration ETo (sometimes called potential evapotranspiration, PET) is defined as the rate of evapotranspiration from a large area covered by green grass which grows actively, completely shades the ground and which is not short of water. The rate of water which evapotranspirates depends on the climate. The highest value of ETo is found in areas which are hot, dry, windy and sunny whereas the lowest values are observed in areas where it is cool, humid and cloudy with little or no wind.
In many cases it will be possible to obtain estimates of ETo for the area of concern (or an area nearby with similar climatic conditions) from the Meteorological Service. However, where this is not possible, the values for ETo have to be calculated. Two easy methods will be explained below:
a. Pan evaporation method
With this method, ETo can be obtained by using evaporation rates which are directly measured with an evaporation pan. This is a shallow pan, containing water which is exposed to the evaporative influence of the climate. The standard pan is the Class A Pan of the US Weather Bureau (Figure 6). It has a diameter of 1.21 m, a depth of 25 cm and is placed 15 cm above the ground.
Figure 6 Class A evaporation pan
An evaporation pan is easy to construct and in most situations the material can be found locally.
The principle of obtaining evaporation rates from the pan is as follows:
- the pan is installed in the field 15 cm above the ground;
- the pan is filled with water 5 cm below the rim;
- the water is allowed to evaporate during a certain period of time (usually 24 hours). For example, each morning at 7.00 hours a measurement is taken. Rainfall, if any, is measured simultaneously;
- after 24 hours, the water depth is measured again;
- the amount of water which has evaporated in a given time unit is equal to the difference between the two measured water depths. This is the pan evaporation rate: Epan (mm/24 hours).
The readings taken from the pan (Epan) however do not give ETo directly, but have to be multiplied by a "Pan Coefficient" (Kpan).
thus: ETo = Epan x Kpan
For the Class A evaporation pan, Kpan varies between 0.35 and 0.85, with an average of 0.70. If the precise pan factor is not known, the average value (0.70) can be used as an approximation. For greater accuracy a detailed table of Kpan figures is given in Irrigation Water Management Training Manual No. 3.
b. The Blaney-Criddle Method
If no measured data on pan evaporation are available, the Blaney-Criddle method can be used to calculate ETo. This method is straightforward and requires only data on mean daily temperatures. However, with this method, only approximations of ETo are obtained which can be inaccurate in extreme conditions.
The Blaney-Criddle formula is: ETo = p(0.46Tmean + 8) where:
ETo = reference crop evapotranspiration (mm/day)
Tmean = mean daily temperature (° C)
p = mean daily percentage of annual daytime hours.
The Blaney-Criddle Method always refers to mean monthly values, both for the temperature and the ETo. If in a local meteorological station the daily minimum and maximum temperatures are measured, the mean daily temperature is calculated as follows:
To determine the value of p. Table 8 is used. To be able to obtain the p value, it is essential to know the approximate latitude of the area: the number of degrees north or south of the Equator.

For example, when p = 0.29 and T mean = 21.5 °C, the ETo is calculated as follows: ETo = 0.29 (0.46 x 21.5 + 8) = 0.29 (9.89 + 8) = 0.29 x 17.89 = 5.2 mm/day.

c. Indicative values of ETo
Table 9 contains approximate values fur ETo which may be used in the absence of measured or calculated figures.
iii. Crop Factor - Kc
In order to obtain the crop water requirement ETcrop the reference crop evapotranspiration, ETo, must be multiplied by the crop factor, Kc. The crop factor (or "crop coefficient") varies according to the growth stage of the crop. There are four growth stages to distinguish:
- the initial stage: when the crop uses little water;
- the crop development stage, when the water consumption increases;
- the mid-season stage, when water consumption reaches a peak;
- the late-season stage, when the maturing crop once again requires less water.
Table 10 contains crop factors for the most commonly crops grown under water harvesting.

Table 10 also contains the number of days which each crop takes over a given growth stage. However, the length of the different crop stages will vary according to the variety and the climatic conditions where the crop is grown. In the semi-arid/arid areas where WH is practised crops will often mature faster than the figures quoted in Table 10.
iv. Calculation of ETcrop
While conventional irrigation strives to maximize the crop yields by applying the optimal amount of water required by the crops at well determined intervals, this is not possible with water harvesting techniques. As already discussed, the farmer or agropastoralist has no influence on the occurrence of the rains neither in time nor in the amount of rainfall.
Bearing the above in mind, it is therefore a common practice to only determine the total amount of water which the crop requires over the whole growing season. As explained in section 2.1.4, the crop water requirement for a given crop is calculated according to the formula:
ETcrop = Kc x ETo
Since the values for ETo are normally measured or calculated on a daily basis (mm/day), an average value for the total growing season has to be determined and then multiplied with the average seasonal crop factor Kc as given in the last column of Table 10.
Example:
Crop to be grown: Sorghum
- length of total growing season: 120 days (sum of all 4 crop stages according to Table 10)
- ETo: average of 6.0 mm/day over the total growing season (from measurement, calculation or Table 9)
Crop water Requirement:
ET crop = kc x Eto
ET crop = 0.78 x 6 = 4.68 mm per day
ET crop = 4.68 x 120 days = approx. 560 mm per total growing season

2.2.1 Multipurpose trees
There is little information available about the water requirements of multipurpose trees planted under rainwater harvesting systems in semi-arid areas. In general, the water requirements for trees are more difficult to determine than for crops. Trees are relatively sensitive to moisture stress during the establishment stage compared with their ability to withstand drought once their root systems are fully developed. There is no accurate information available on the response of these species, in terms of yields, to different irrigation/water regimes.
Table 11 gives some basic data of multipurpose trees often planted in semi-arid areas. The critical stage for most trees is in the first two years of seedling/sapling establishment.

2.2.3 Water requirements of rangeland and fodder
Water requirements for rangeland and fodder species grown in semi-arid/arid areas under WH systems are usually not calculated.
The objective is to improve performance, within economic constraints, and to ensure the survival of the plants from season to season, rather than fully satisfying water requirements.

2.3.1 Introduction
The physical, chemical and biological properties of the soil affect the yield response of plants to extra moisture harvested. Generally the soil characteristics for water harvesting should be the same as those for irrigation.
Ideally the soil in the catchment area should have a high runoff coefficient while the soil in the cultivated area should be a deep, fertile loam. Where the conditions for the cultivated and catchment areas conflict, the requirements of the cultivated area should always take precedence.
The following are important aspects of soils which affect plant performance under WH systems.
