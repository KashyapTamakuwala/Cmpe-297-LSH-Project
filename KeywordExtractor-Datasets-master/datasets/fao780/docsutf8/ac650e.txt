INFORMATION NOTE ON THE FAO PROGRAMME ON FOREST FINANCE.
It is generally accepted that financial considerations represent one of the most important factors that can have an impact on the implementation of sustainable forest management. With this in mind, the FAO Forestry Department has implemented a programme of work on forest finance, to examine how government policies (in forestry and other sectors) affect financing in the forestry sector and the consequences of such policies for sustainable forest management. One of the most important ways in which governments can have an impact on financing in the forestry sector is through the fiscal policies that they implement within the sector. Where forests are owned or managed by the state, the way in which charges for the use of forest resources are determined and implemented can have a major impact on the scale and types of investment in the sector. A vast literature has developed over the last 30 years examining this topic. Other fiscal policies, such as taxes and subsidies both within and outside the sector, can also have a significant impact on the forestry sector. The purpose of this work will be to review the impact of current fiscal policies on sustainable forest management, along with other related policies, such as land tenure, which have an impact on forest financing. However, the work will attempt to go beyond simple financial analyses of current policies (which have largely been done before) to examine the broader social, institutional and political aspects of policy reform. It is hoped that this work will assist forestry administrations to identify practical ways in which they can revise their fiscal policies, so that they can more easily pursue the goal of sustainable forest management. This work has been funded through the FAO Regular Programme and the EC Tropical Forestry Budget Line (FAO-EC Partnership Project on Sustainable Forest Management in African ACP Countries). A large part of the work has been produced by national consultants and institutions, with the supervision and assistance of FAO. Working papers are being produced and issued as they arrive. Some effort at uniformity of presentation is being attempted, but the contents are only minimally edited for style or clarity. FAO welcomes from readers any information that they feel would be useful for this work.

This report describes the forest revenue system in Mali. It describes the different forest taxes that are levied on wood production and forest clearance, along with some of the more general taxes that should be paid. It also shows the trends in total revenue collection over the last decade and explains how this revenue should be shared amongst different stakeholders. It presents some information about public expenditure on forestry, which is somewhat higher than the amount of revenue collected. It also discusses at length the difficulties with raising taxes and the problem that the total amount of taxes collected is insufficient to cover the investment required to implement sustainable forest management.
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY.
The forest revenue system in Mali is not defined very well. However, forest taxes should be paid for harvesting wood from all types of forest (state, communal and private forests), except in cases where harvesting is for non-commercial or subsistence use. It is believed that this exception results in a lot of tax evasion. Taxes should be paid for the production of industrial roundwood, wood fuel and for forest clearance. The taxes on production are differentiated according to species and the type of forest where the harvesting takes place (i.e. controlled or managed harvesting as opposed to uncontrolled or unmanaged harvesting). The taxes on forest clearance are also differentiated by geographical region. Taxes are not currently levied on the production of NWFPs or on any other forestry activities. However, taxes on NWFP production will probably be introduced in the near future. Forest taxes in Mali have been revised seven times since 1960 and were revised most recently in 1995, 1998 and 2001. However, the revision of taxes is not based on any scientific methodology and it is often difficult to implement tax increases. It is believed that the current level of forest taxes and revenue collection is totally inadequate to meet the need for reinvestment in the sector. Thus, in this respect, the forest revenue system does little to support sustainable forest management. Most of the forest taxes are collected by the Nature Conservation Service but, in some areas, local management structures have been developed that participate in forest management (including tax collection). All money collected from forest taxes is sent to the national treasury, since the national forest fund was abolished in 1993. However, new laws have been passed recently that introduce arrangements for revenue sharing amongst different stakeholders. These arrangements include incentives for forestry personnel and others to report and try to stop illegal activities. The total revenue collected from the sector includes revenue from the following sub-sectors: forestry; hunting; fishing; and other activities. Forestry accounts for the largest share of this by far (about 80%). In addition, the total amount of revenue collected is divided into revenue from harvesting taxes and revenue from transactions (e.g. fines and penalties). Over the last decade, the amount of revenue collected from transactions has approached 50% of the total in some years, but it usually only accounts for about 10% to 25% of the total. Total revenue collection is currently just under 200 million FCFA per year, which is much less than the amount collected in the late 1980's (over 300 million FCFA). Information about total public expenditure on forestry is only partially available for recent years. Excluding project expenditure, the average level of public expenditure on forestry was just under 3 billion FCFA per year from 1987 to 1991. From 1992 to 1995, the amount was slightly higher at just over 4 billion FCFA per year on average. About two-thirds of this money came from foreign donors. Over the last decade, forestry projects have amounted to additional expenditure of 9.4 billion FCFA, with almost all of this money coming from foreign donors. As these figures show, public expenditure on forestry is probably ten to twenty times higher than the total amount of revenue collected from the sector. There are a number of problems with the current fiscal policies in the forestry sector in Mali. Firstly, the most important problem is that the level of taxes does not reflect the true cost of.
replacing the wood and other products that are harvested. However, a second problem is that it is also very difficult to raise taxes in such a poor country. Previous attempts to raise forest taxes have led to social problems as producers have passed on the costs of these increases to consumers. It is recommended in this report that taxes should be raised, but that measures should also be introduced to reduce the impact of this on consumers. In addition, it is suggested that the revenue sharing arrangements should give a greater priority to retaining revenue for forest management and that forest funds should be re-established to facilitate the recycling of tax money back into investment in the sector. A more general problem concerns the overall strength of government finances in Mali. The government does not have a strong tax-base, so the budgets of public sector institutions are generally small and are inadequate to finance all of the investment required to achieve sustainable forest management. Donors have provided a lot of support to the forestry sector in the country in the past, but their priorities do not always match the national priorities. It is suggested that some sort of mechanism should be introduced to improve co-ordination between government forestry institutions, donors and non-governmental organisations.

INTRODUCTION.
This report has been drafted under the framework of the EU-FAO Partnership Programme on sustainable forest management in African ACP countries, as part of the project on the reform of fiscal policies affecting forest management. The report examines the tax system for forestry and public spending on sustainable forest management in Mali and includes the following information: · · · · · a description of the tax system for forestry; a discussion of the administration of the tax system for forestry; statistics on the total amount and distribution of revenue collected; statistics on public spending on the forestry sector; and discussion of the results and conclusions.
Mali has a surface area of 1,241,238 km² (see Figure 1), of which 29% is occupied by forests. According to current legislation (Law-95-004), the forest estate is divided into three types of forest: · · · state forests; forests run by territorial communities; and forests run by private individuals.
Mali's population is essentially a rural one (72.1% of the total), of which 80% depends on primary industry. The management of forests and, more generally, of natural resources was exclusively reserved to the state by the means of quite coercive legislation (Forestry Code, State Code). Unfortunately this form of management did not succeed in curbing the degradation of forestry resources, in spite of the enormous efforts made through various forestry projects, mainly due to an imbalance between the ever-increasing needs of the population and the decreasing existing potential. This degradation was also due to the deterioration in climatic conditions. The reasons for human pressure on forestry resources are linked to social factors (runaway population growth) and particularly to economic factors. Indeed, the woodfuel sector alone represents an annual turnover of 10 billion to 14 billion FCFA, because 90% of the domestic energy resources in Mali are made up of woodfuel. Thus, the forestry sector's contribution to GNP is estimated at 5% in monetary terms. For some years now, forestry harvesting has become the main activity for rural populations after crop harvesting, because it provides substantial income that enables people to make ends meet.
The principle of putting back the resource that has been harvested has led the government to introduce taxes on wood harvesting, but these are derisory compared with the real value of wood. Law 96-050 of 16 October 1996, outlining the principles of the constitution and management of forests administered by territorial communities, lays down in Article 25 that: "The rates of tax collected for harvesting on forests run by territorial communities are set by the competent representatives of the territorial community following consultation with the Chamber of Agriculture." However, this regulation has not yet been applied due to a lack of demarcation and effective transfer of forestry areas from the state to communities. For the moment, all tax is collected by the state itself, which then pays it to the public revenue department. It is thus not possible to indicate the forest area per domain before their transfer to territorial communities. Figure 1 A map of Mali.

DESCRIPTION OF THE TAX SYSTEM FOR FORESTRY.
In the Republic of Mali, the tax system for forestry is not rigorously defined. Forestry law does, however, generally envisage tax obligations. Thus, apart from exceptional exemptions for users, there is no right to harvest forest products free of charge. It goes without saying that all harvesters must pay fees and taxes in order to obtain harvesting rights, which are collected from the following permits: · · taxes on the (forest) surface area and the right to transfer work sites; and fees on exploration permits and permits for felling firewood and charcoal.
The following taxes and fees are also collected, based on the quantities of products harvested: · · a fixed-fee (per standing tree) for tree felling sites and a fee for a felling permit for industrial roundwood for processing (bois d'oeuvre); and fees for felling permits for other industrial roundwood (bois de service).
However, income from forestry activities falls into the category of agricultural revenue and is, therefore, provisionally exempt from proportional taxes. But it should be stated that current legislation concerning regulations for agricultural profits within the General Tax Code have not yet been passed. The only references in place for forestry taxation are essentially the following basic laws: · · · · · · Law number 96-050 of 16 October 1996, which outlines the principles of the constitution and management of forests run by territorial communities; Law number 96-051 of 16 October 1996, which determines the fiscal resources of districts; Law number 95-003 of 18 January 1995, which outlines the organisation of the harvesting, transport and sale of wood; Law number 95-004 of 18 January 1995, which establishes the conditions for the management of forestry resources; Decree number 97-053/PRM, which fixes the rates of tax on clearing state forest areas and defines the official southern limit of the Sahelian zone; and Decree number 98-402/P-RM of 17 December 1998, which sets down the rates, the methods of collection and the distribution of tax collected on the harvesting of wood in state forests.
In analysing these laws, three types of forestry taxation emerge: · · · taxation on the harvesting of wood in state forests (Decree 98-402); taxation on the harvesting of wood in forests run by territorial communities (undefined); and taxation on the harvesting of wood in forests run by private individuals (tax collection is carried out by the relevant tax services as outlined in the General Tax Code).
The main free user right is the right of individuals in rural communities resident in forests to harvest wood for their domestic use, provided that it is not for sale. This user right is fully exercised by all rural communities. Indeed, outside of urban centres (district county towns), rural populations are not subject to any tax. It should be noted that, in some cases, this user right is contravened and people sell wood. The main cause of this phenomenon is the general level of poverty.
Taxes on the production of roundwood.
Industrial roundwood is any log or branch that is used in its round form (untreated) or as primary matter for mechanical or chemical transformation for obtaining finished products (sawnwood, planks, plywood etc.). The measurement unit used is the cubic metre or standing tree. In this report, roundwood is classed as industrial roundwood for processing (bois d'oeuvre) if it is any log, trunk or block having a diameter greater than 25cm. The forms or permits used for tax collection from roundwood harvesting are the same as those used for other forestry products. As well as the harvesting permit, a transport coupon is issued for monitoring the origin and circulation of forestry products. With regard to fines on the fraudulent harvesting or transport of wood, when these are collected, a receipt or bill is issued from the public revenue department. As a general rule, taxes on roundwood production are determined by Decree 98-402/P-RM of 17 December 1998, setting down the rates and methods of collection of taxes paid for the harvesting of wood from state forests. All taxes paid for roundwood harvesting are paid to the Nature Conservation Service. The rates of tax depend on whether the products come from natural forests or state forest plantations and vary according to the type of harvesting and tree species. However, with regard to the harvesting of wood in forests run by private individuals, taxes are paid by the harvester, whether they are the owner of the forest or just the holder of a harvesting permit. The taxes paid are either the fixed charges applied elsewhere (i.e. in the tax system for other types of forest) or are based on profits. The rate of tax on profits is an ad valorem tax of up to 10% (see Table 1 to Table 3 for the amounts and rates of taxes charged on the production of roundwood).
For other activities covered by the regulations on the use of state forests (e.g. making harvesting and access roads, bridges or other works, as well as establishing factories and barriers) there are no specific taxes. However, all large-scale work in these areas is subject to Decree number 99-189/P-RM of 5 July 1999 outlining the procedures and requirements for Environmental Impact Assessments. 2.1.1 Taxes on the production of industrial roundwood.
The rates of tax collected from the harvesting of wood in state forests vary according to whether the products are from natural forests or state forest plantations and depend on the nature of the products (i.e. woodfuel, other industrial roundwood (bois de service) or industrial roundwood for processing (bois d'oeuvre)). The tax rate also varies according to the type of area harvested: uncontrolled; guided; or controlled (incontrôlée; orientée or contrôlée). This measure stems from the concern to direct wood harvesting towards controlled areas, so as to ensure that appropriate harvesting techniques are used (i.e. correct felling techniques, harvesting within the allowed quota). For controlled areas, the tax rate on the production of industrial roundwood for processing is varied according to the diameter of the wood. The greater the diameter, the higher the tax rate. This difference reflects the market value of the wood (see Table 1). Table 1.

The tax rate for harvesting industrial roundwood for processing and other industrial roundwood from state forest plantations depends both on the diameter of the wood and the quality of the wood. Therefore, species like Kaya sénégalensis, Gmelima arborea and Tectona grandis have the highest rates of tax levied on them (see Table 3).
Taxes on the production of woodfuel.
Generally, for harvesting woodfuel in state forests, the rates of tax collected from natural forests vary by origin and type of product (essentially fuelwood and charcoal) and they vary by species in state forest plantations. Fuelwood and charcoal taxes are based on volume (per stacked cubic metre (stère) for fuelwood and per quintal for charcoal) and the rates of tax vary according to the nature of species and depending on where the harvesting took place (uncontrolled, guided or controlled harvesting ­ see Table 4). In state forest plantations, taxes are also based on volume (per stacked cubic metre) and apply to both native and exotic species (see Table 5). Table 4.

Variation in the structure of regional forestry taxation.
Because of the specific nature of different regions, the charges for issuing permits to clear land in state forests vary between regions. In the Sahelian zone, the fee for a permit to clear land with destumping is 7,500 FCFA/ha and the fee for clearing without destumping is 5,000 FCFA/ha. In the Sudanian zone, 15,000 FCFA/ha is charged for clearing with destumping as opposed to 10,000 FCFA/ha for clearing without destumping.
Taxes on non-wood forest products and services.
In Mali, up until 2000, these products and services were not taxed because of a legal loophole. There is a flourishing business in these products and services both inside and outside the country. Non-wood forest products, such as: leaves; bark; roots; fruit; and herbs, provide significant income to a section of the population who devote themselves to collecting these products (mostly women and young people). Harvesting other products, such as: gum arabic; and shea tree kernels, is a flourishing export business and the revenue generated from these exports is significant (see Table 6). This legal loophole will soon be closed when the Cabinet passes a decree on this subject.

Taxes on the trade of forestry products and transformed products.
Mali does not envisage any regulations on the taxation of transformed forestry products nor on the trade of forestry products. These are the concern of other public institutions.
Other taxes.
In a broad sense, the tax system for forestry includes additional levies and taxes as set down in the General Tax Code. In effect, these additional levies are additional taxes levied on the harvesting of wood. 2.4.1 Environmental tax on wood.
There is an Environmental Tax on Wood (ETW), which aims to cover the costs of forestry development and the implementation of sustainable forest management and to finance collective investments in villages. This tax is applied nationwide, with payment in the form of a Local Tax on Wood (LTW). This tax is redistributed in the form of a Forestry Policy Tax (FPT), which aims to provide incentives to the sector to act in the chosen direction or to directly finance forestry development activities. This tax is administered through a forestry network promotion fund, which is generally distributed amongst forestry professionals, the Permanent Association of the Malian Chambers of Agriculture (PAMCA) and the Nature Conservation Service (NCS). 2.4.2 Taxation of forests run by territorial communities.
Decree number 98-402/P-RM of 17 December 1998, fixes the rates, methods of collection and distribution of taxes collected on the harvesting of wood in state forests. This decree does not mention the taxation of wood harvesting in forests run by territorial communities. Territorial communities are authorised to apply taxation in their respective areas according to Article 25 of Law number 96-050 of 16 October 1996, applying the principles of the constitution to the management of the area of territorial communities. To this effect, the rates of tax collected in the case of wood harvesting in territorial community areas should be fixed by the competent authorities of the territorial community, following consultation with the chamber of agriculture. In fact, the series of taxes decreed by the basic forestry taxation laws are automatically applicable to the activity and to the harvesters in the woodfuel sector. By referring to existing laws regarding the fiscal resources of towns, all executive authorities should deliberate on the rates of municipal taxes.
The rates of fines for the fraudulent transport of wood vary from 5,000 FCFA to 50,000 FCFA (Article 23 of Law 95-003). The rates of fines for the fraudulent harvesting of fuelwood and charcoal vary by quantity and are shown in Table.
In addition to these regulations, in Article 86 of Law 95-004, there are fines from 5,000 FCFA to 100,000 FCFA for the fraudulent harvesting of other forest products. Table 7 Fines on the fraudulent harvesting of fuelwood and charcoal (in FCFA) Fuelwood Quantity Less than 1 m³ From 1 to 4 m³ From 5 to 15 m³ From 16 to 30 m³ From 31 to 60 m³ More than 60 m³.
