TABLE OF TABLES.
INFORMATION NOTE ON THE FAO PROGRAMME ON FOREST FINANCE It is generally accepted that financial considerations represent one of the most important factors that can have an impact on the implementation of sustainable forest management. With this in mind, the FAO Forestry Department has implemented a programme of work on forest finance, to examine how government policies (in forestry and other sectors) affect financing in the forestry sector and the consequences of such policies for sustainable forest management. One of the most important ways in which governments can have an impact on financing in the forestry sector is through the fiscal policies that they implement within the sector. Where forests are owned or managed by the state, the way in which charges for the use of forest resources are determined and implemented can have a major impact on the scale and types of investment in the sector. A vast literature has developed over the last 30 years examining this topic. Other fiscal policies, such as taxes and subsidies both within and outside the sector, can also have a significant impact on the forestry sector. The purpose of this work will be to review the impact of current fiscal policies on sustainable forest management, along with other related policies, such as land tenure, which have an impact on forest financing. However, the work will attempt to go beyond simple financial analyses of current policies (which have largely been done before) to examine the broader social, institutional and political aspects of policy reform. It is hoped that this work will assist forestry administrations to identify practical ways in which they can revise their fiscal policies, so that they can more easily pursue the goal of sustainable forest management. This work has been funded through the FAO Regular Programme and the EC Tropical Forestry Budget Line (FAO-EC Partnership Project on Sustainable Forest Management in African ACP Countries). A large part of the work has been produced by national consultants and institutions, with the supervision and assistance of FAO. Working papers are being produced and issued as they arrive. Some effort at uniformity of presentation is being attempted, but the contents are only minimally edited for style or clarity.

This report describes the forest resource of Liberia and how it is managed. In particular, it describes how the revenue accruing from the sales of the resource is shared. Liberia has a total of 2,085,898 ha of forest land. This is a major source of revenue, contributing between 5-9 percent to the country's GDP. The forest resource is managed by Forestry Development Authority, which is the only government arm given the authority to control the utilisation of the resource and determine charges on forest products and land rentals. Liberia has many charges and regulations for the purpose of forest product utilisation. Some of the charges that are used in Liberia are: severance charge (USD 1.50/m3), reforestation charge (USD 5.00/m3) and conservation charge (USD 4.00/m3). Apart from these charges on timber products, non-timber forest products also attract charges of various levels. Fines also occupy a very important position as a source of revenue to the country. Ironically, even with all the many charges and fines, Liberia collects only USD 7,849,568 in charges against a proposed expenditure of USD 7,918,831, leaving a deficit of USD 69,263. The report recommends that the forest revenue collection system should be improved to introduce more effective and efficient monitoring to earn enough revenue to cover annual expenditure on forestry development in Liberia.
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY.
Liberia is situated on the West Coast of Africa. The population of the country is estimated at 2.5 million people with a growth rate of 3.2 percent per annum. The country's land area covers 37,150 square miles (9,675,000 ha). Of this, National Forests and one National Park occupy 2,085,898 ha. The forestry sector is a major source of revenue. The sector's contribution to GDP and foreign exchange earnings ranged between 4-8 percent and 5-9 percent respectively prior to the inception of the civil crisis. The granting of Forest Products Utilization Agreements (contracts) is based on size classes of holdings (Class A, B and C). The duration of an agreement is 25 years. Timber production in the natural forest is controlled and regulated by a forest management plan, which has two instruments of control (annual cutting of only 4 percent of an allotted concession area and diameter cutting limits on different species). Besides these measures, there are forestry laws, policies, rules and regulations in force to ensure the sustainable management of the forest and associated resources. Only foreign companies carry out timber production and processing in the forestry sector. There are no state owned forest enterprises. Production charges are based on volume and the basic unit for forest timber revenue assessment is the cubic meter. Forest revenue generation is determined by the application of volume-based charges and land rental charges. In addition to these, special charges (referred to as administrative fees) are also levied. There are no land rental charges on privately owned forest lands or charges on processed forest products designated for domestic consumption, but annual permit fees are levied for the production and sale of non-wood forest products. In addition, charges on processed forest products designated for export are very low, with the aim of promoting domestic processing. Furthermore, simple annual permit fees are levied for the hunting of animals and bushmeat sales. The monitoring, assessment of production and generation of primary statistics is the sole responsibility of the Forestry Development Authority (FDA). However, the determination of forest charges is carried out by the Ministry of Finance and the FDA in collaboration with an inter-sectoral committee of ministries and agencies, comprising experts in finance, law, economics, forestry and management. Charges are regularly updated, based on fluctuations in world market prices (FOB) and local production costs. For any new charge structure, a regulation is promulgated, published in the print media and made publicly available prior to enforcement. The procedure for the implementation of the forest revenue system is simple. The rules for assessment, payment and collection are clear. Notwithstanding this, the level of actual collection is not satisfactory. Actual collection accounts for only 30 percent of what should be collected, while arrears constitute the remaining 70 percent (in 1999-2000). In addition, assessed charges are low, on average accounting for only 6 percent of the FOB value of products (in 1998-2000).
The forestry field services and forest revenue collection efforts are weak. They must be strengthened in order for the forest revenue system to have a positive impact on sustainable forest management. This would enable the Government of Liberia (GOL) to realise the full revenue generation potential of the forestry sector. The forest revenue collected is shared only between the Ministry of Finance and the Forestry Development Authority (as spelled out in the Executive Order No. 4, dated 22 June 2000). Liberia is a unitary state, so the collection of forest revenue is centralised and does not involve regional administrations. Furthermore, revenue is not shared directly with other stakeholders. In addition, there are no grants or subsidies for stakeholders operating in the forestry sector. These conditions make the net effect of the forest revenue system unfair and inequitable. The Government of Liberia's present attitude towards the sustainable management of the forest and associated resources is positive. Recent pronouncements and policy documents include the Forestry Law (approved 6 April 2000) and Executive Order No. 4 (22 June 2000), which aim at the strengthening of the financial capacity of the FDA. The GOL also recognises that increased domestic processing and environmental protection are two of the surest ways of sustaining the forest estate. The present Government has constituted a Commission on the Environment. However, forestry research, reforestation and wildlife management programs and projects are yet to be restored to their pre-civil crisis status. There is a need to prioritise these areas of forestry undertakings in the years to come. The current budget of the FDA is estimated at USD 7.9 million and USD 3.3 million is allotted for forestry research, reforestation and wildlife management. This is a positive sign and, therefore, these budget allocations must be obtained for the enhancement and sustainability of the nation's forest resources.
INTRODUCTION.
Description of the country and present forestry situation.
Liberia is situated on the West Coast of Africa and has a population of 2.5 million people with a growth rate of about 3.2 percent per annum (1990 estimates). The total land area of the country is 37,150 square miles (9,675,000 ha). Of this, high forests occupy 4.8 million ha or 49.8 percent of the total land area and National Forests and National Parks cover 2,085,898 ha (see Table 1 to Table 4). In the high forests, the extractable commercial timber volume is estimated to be 3.2 million cubic meters per annum, based on a 25-year felling cycle and an estimated commercial growing stock of 21.7 cubic metres per hectare.

Status of land ownership and tenure.
There is no clearly defined land ownership and tenure in Liberia. However, in practice, in an effort to minimise conflict, forest land is allotted to the following three categories: · Public land. This belongs to the state and includes the National Forests, nature reserves, National Parks and other protected areas. · Private Land. This is land owned by private individuals, business entities and cooperatives. This is obtained by the granting of a public land deed by the GOL. · Communal Land. This is land set aside for the exclusive use of local communities for purposes other than logging. All forest areas (including forests outside the National Forests) are subject to charges, except privately owned forest plantations. The logging companies granted harvesting contracts and operating in the National Forests pay charges to the Government, while those operating on private and community lands pay charges to the owners (provided that they have legal title). The natural forests outside the National Forests are also state owned. These areas are granted to loggers for salvage operations. Part of the National Forests includes 570,334 ha for proposed parks and nature reserves. In the Liberian forestry context, a productive forest is protected by law to prevent encroachment through shifting cultivation, although enforcement has been illusive. In such a forest, the stocking is usually high but is not split into protection and production forest categories. Many of the species that occur in such forests are not harvested because their physical and mechanical properties have not been established (and, hence, they are not traded in international markets). The term unproductive forest means logged-over and degraded forest area with low stocking. Such forest areas are usually granted to loggers for salvage operations for the extraction of commercial species and are later allotted to farmers for agricultural purposes. Artificial forest plantations, National Parks and nature reserves cover 10,158 ha and 701,087 ha respectively (see Table 4 and Table 5). However, most of the figures in Table 1 to Table 5 have certainly changed due to the recent civil crises.
Forestry's contribution to the national economy.
The forest is a potential source of revenue for economic development in Liberia. The sector's contribution to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and foreign exchange earnings, prior to the civil crisis, ranged from 4-8 percent and 5-9 percent respectively (Table 6 and Table 7). Table 6.

Description of forest harvesting agreements (contracts).
With respect to forest land granted for the purpose of logging, all investment agreements are negotiated with the relevant agencies, including: the National Investment Commission (NIC); the Forestry Development Authority (FDA); the Ministry of Finance (MOF); and the Ministry of Justice (MOJ). An agreement becomes binding when approved by the President of the Republic of Liberia. The forest harvesting agreement is called a Forest Products Utilization Agreement (FPUA) and these are divided into different size classes, each of which has different obligations. These are summarised as follows: (i) Class A Agreement: A Class A Agreement holder is entitled to a minimum of 2,000,000 acres (800,000 ha) of forest land. The holder of a Class A Agreement is required to develop and install a large-scale integrated wood processing industry comprising of a sawmill, veneer, plywood, or particleboard mill, along with kiln drying facilities, preservation plants and disposable sawdust and waste facilities. Class B Agreement: A Class B Agreement holder is entitled to a minimum of 1,000,000 acres (400,000 ha) up to a maximum of 1,999,000 acres (799,600 ha) of forest land. The holder of a Class B Agreement is required to develop a.
medium-scale wood processing industry, comprising of a sawmill and/or kiln drying and wood treatment facilities. (iii) Class C Agreement: A Class C Agreement holder is entitled to a minimum of 300,000 acres or (120,000 ha) of forestland. Only Liberians are eligible to hold a Class C Forest Products Utilization Agreement. The holder of a Class C Agreement is required to develop a small-scale wood processing industry, comprising of a sawmill and/or kiln drying facilities.
The duration of an Agreement is for a period of twenty-five years (one felling cycle), with an annual felling coupe of four percent of the total area. Agreements are renewable upon expiry. The instrument under which the above arrangement became law is the New National Forestry Law, published on 11 December 2000.
Guidelines for the granting of Forest Products Utilization Agreements.
Any person or company wishing to engage in forestry activities must demonstrate that they have the necessary legal, technical and financial capabilities. In addition, they must comply with the following procedures:.
Submit a written application to the FDA, including the name of the individual or company and mailing address;.
for a Survey Permit, they must submit a Business Registration Certificate, Article of Incorporation, Notary Certificate and pay a Performance Bond;.
to obtain an Agreement, they must submit a work plan, including: a list of the species to be felled; an average monthly production target (m3); a list of the type of equipment to be used; a description of the type of sawmill established or to be established; and a feasibility study on the wood processing plant; and.
to start work in an annual coupe, they must submit the results of a 100 percent stock survey (enumeration) and stock maps indicating felling blocks. In addition to the above, applicants must agree to employ professional foresters (two BSc Degree holders for Classes A and B or one professional forester for Class C). They must also reserve 25 percent of their shares for local Liberian entrepreneurs (15 percent for co-operatives and 10 percent for individual Liberians) and must agree to retain 20 percent of their annual net profits for investment in Liberia.
Guidelines for the exportation of timber and timber products.
The export of timber and timber products (mostly roundwood) accounts for about 64 percent of total annual production. The new National Forestry Law (NFL) empowers the FDA to control and supervise the harvesting and export of timber, timber products and other forest products. In light of this, there are a number of prescribed forms (documents) that must be completed and approved before shipment is allowed. These documents include the following: · Export waybill; · Specification of species; · Sale contracts receipt (SCR); · Sale contracts (SC); · Export permit request (EPR); · FDA clearance, and · Export permit approved by the FDA.
DESCRIPTION OF THE FOREST REVENUE SYSTEM.
Charges on roundwood production.
Foreign companies mainly carry out harvesting and processing activities in the Liberian forestry sector. Currently, there are 27 registered companies and 22 primary sawmills in Liberia (see Annex 1). Charges on roundwood production are based on the volume harvested (in cubic meters) and are levied on all species in all types of land ownership. In addition, there are a number of other charges on roundwood production.
Volume-based charges.
Volume-based charges are levied on the whole length of every tree felled for commercial purpose, irrespective of species, grade and intended use. They comprise the following four types of charge:.
Severance Charge: USD 1.50/m3;.
Reforestation Charge: USD 5.00/m3 - revenue generated from this charge is intended to be used solely for funding reforestation (artificial plantation) projects and programs;.
Conservation Charge: USD 4.00/m3 for Class A species and USD 2.50/m3 for Class B species (see ) - revenue collected is for implementation of conservation activities; and.
Forest Research Charge: USD 1.00/m3 - revenue generated from this charge is for research and development activities. Table 8 Species allocated to each species class for the purpose of charge assessment.

Other charges on roundwood production.
In addition to the volume-based charges, a Land Rental Fee (USD 0.50 per acre per month) is charged in each Agreement area (the granting of non-concession or salvage permits as been abolished). For harvesting in private forests, producers pay all production charges except the Land Rental Fee. This is because such land is not owned by the Government. There are also special levies (called administrative fees) and they are shown in Table.

Note: the Performance Bond is paid prior to operation by the concessionaire is and refundable upon satisfactory performance. The amount of the Performance Bond was set in the Act creating the FDA on 20 December 1976. Marking and grading fees are charged for the inspection and grading of exports and are collected by BIVAC, a subsidiary of a foreign inspection company.
The GOL does not impose road and bridge fees, as logging companies finance the construction of their own logging roads and bridges. These roads and bridges also serve the local communities, by providing rural infrastructure that helps to increase agricultural production and bring about improvements in the livelihood of rural people. However, although it is the responsibility of the GOL to construct and maintain major highways, when the government does not have funds for this, a logging company will often be requested to carry out this work (under a Memorandum of Understanding). When this occurs, the cost of the road works is deducted from the charges that should be paid by the company. Liberia is a unitary state, so there is no regional variation in the forest charges. All forest harvesting rights are covered under the Forest Products Utilization Agreements and charges are the same from publicly and privately owned forest land irrespective of location. However, charges are varied (by species and wood type or quality) for roundwood (i.e. the Conservation Charge) and processed forest products designated for export. For wood traded on the domestic market, wood is graded only for pricing purposes. No charges are levied on processed forest products designated for domestic consumption. This strategy is designed to encourage domestic processing.
Charges for production of non-wood forest products and services.
The production of non-wood forest products (NWFPs) and services is mostly for subsistence. There is no organised establishment (e.g. co-operative) for management and development of NWFPs and information about the sector is scarce. Hence, the contribution of this sector to local incomes, GDP and foreign exchange earnings is unknown. However, the livelihood of the bulk of the population (maybe 70-80 percent) is dependent on these products. Extraction or harvesting of NWFPs occurs in both publicly and privately owned forests and is controlled by regulations promulgated and enforced by the FDA. Currently, charges for the production and sale of NWFPs and services are not based on the amounts extracted and sold, but are levied as annual permit fees (see Table 10). These fees are the same for harvesting in publicly and privately owned forests.

Note: the above fees were introduced in 1998 (Regulation No. 23).
Annual fees are collected for radio masts located in the forest, but there are not any payments for other forest services (e.g. pipelines through the forest, carbon storage, ecotourism development, etc.).
Charges on the production of processed forest products.
There are no charges on the production of processed forest products except corporate income tax, which is levied on the net profit of every company at a rate of four percent.
Charges on forest products trade.
Exports of forest products account for about 60 percent of annual production (see Table 16). Charges are based on the volume of production designated as export production rather than actual trade volumes. The charges levied on roundwood and processed forest products comprise two fees: the Industrialization Incentive Fee and the Forest Products Fee.
Industrialization Incentive Fee.
The Industrialization Incentive Fee (IIF) is levied on the volume of roundwood designated for export and varies according to species. In this context, the designated export volume means the volume that the producer declares they will export. The IIF may or may not be paid before the volume actually goes through the port and the total amount of assessed charges may not be paid in full before shipment. The IIF currently varies from USD 1.44/m3 to USD 58.56/m3, with the rate varying according to the market value of the species (the historical trend in the IIF from 1979 to 1988 is shown in Table 11). This charging strategy is intended to support sustainable forest management and conservation by reducing the incentive to cut only the most valuable species ("creaming" the crop). It also aims to promote the harvesting of less well known species, in order to increase the total production volume per ha (i.e. increase the harvesting intensity in the forest). Furthermore, the imposition of the IIF discourages the export of roundwood altogether. Table 11 Changes to the Industrialization Incentive Fee in 1979 to 1988.
