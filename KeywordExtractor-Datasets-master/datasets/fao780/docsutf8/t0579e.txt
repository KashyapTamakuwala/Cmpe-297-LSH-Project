APPENDIX A - Machine Cost and Work Records
Machine rates, unit costs, and machine utilization, can be compiled on a weekly basis for use in comparison and control. The weekly machine costs, accummulated over a period of time, provide estimates of the hourly machine cost or machine rate for planning and budgeting.
The basis for the weekly report is the daily report (Figure A.1). This report records the hour meter or odometer reading at the end of the day, the amounts of materials supplied to the machine, the number of machine hours worked and any additional hours worked by the operator which are not machine hours. An estimate of the production is made. Either at the end of the day, or weekly, the unit costs of the materials consumed are added to the daily report so that the daily operating costs for the machine are complete.
The daily machine cost and work record is kept for all machines. The weekly report can be compiled individually by machine or collectively for all machines of the same type using a form similar to the Weekly Machine Cost and Work Record (Figure A.2). Figure A. 2 column (25) is the weekly estimate of the machine hourly cost. Column (27) is the weekly unit production cost. Column (29) is the machine utilization for the week.

Enter the equipment meter reading or odometer reading from the end of the last day of the week and subtract it from the reading from the last day of the previous week to obtain a total for the week.
Add columns 3, 5, 1, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 18, and 19 to obtain the total operating cost for the machine during the week.
Add the total wages including social costs for the operators and helpers using the equipment. Do not add in the labor for repairs included in Col (19).
Add up the total depreciation, interest, taxes, license, insurance and any other fixed costs and divide by 52 to establish the weekly ownership cost. Once calculated, it will usually not change during the year.
To obtain the hourly machine cost during the week, add up the operating, labor, and ownership costs and divide by the number of hours worked by the machine.
Enter the production summed up from the daily work sheets from the past week.
Divide the total cost by the total production to determine the unit cost of production for the week.
Enter the total number of hours the machine was scheduled to operate for the week.
Divide the total number hours the machine worked by the number of hours it was scheduled to work and multiply by 100 to calculate the machine utilization in percent.
The weekly cost and work report is a valuable record not only for deriving your own machine rates, but for discussions with the crew and foreman so that they are aware of the costs of machine operation.
An additional column can be added to the form to show the importance of increased machine utilization. This additional column could be called the hourly machine cost at 100% utilization. If labor is a constant cost for the week, the hourly machine rate at 100% utilization is calculated as
APPENDIX B - Field Production Studies
To estimate cycle time coefficients, the observer should study the operation until he is familiar with the elements making up the activity. A flow process chart can then be prepared to describe the elements and define the beginning and ending points of each element. A data collection form is prepared, data collected and coefficients calculated.
The observer gathering the time study data must be able to see the operation he is studying at all times. Often he must constantly move with the equipment in order to record the element times, while simultaneously keeping a safe distance from the operation.
For example, let's design a study form to develop cycle time coefficients for a skidding operation. We would like to estimate the loaded speed, unloaded speed, load size, hook time and unhook time for a rubber-tired skidder. The flow process for the skidding activity would be
Element
Element Begin (B) and End (E) Point
Skidder travels to logs
(B) - Skidder leaves landing.
(E) - Skidder arrives at first log pickup point.
Position skidder
(B) - Skidder arrives at first log pickup point.
(E) - Begin pulling winch line from skidder.
Lateral outhaul
(B) - Begin pulling winch line from skidder.
(E) - Winch line arrives at log(s)
Hook Log
(B) - Winch line arrives at log(s)
(E) - Winch line starts in toward skidder.
Lateral Inhaul
(B) - Winch line starts in toward skidder.
(E) - Logs arrive at skidder.
Intermediate Move
(B) - Logs arrive at skidder.
(E) - Skidder moves to next pickup point.
Position skidder
(B) - Skidder moves to next log pickup point.
(E) - Begin pulling winch line from skidder.
Lateral outhaul
(B) - Begin pulling winch line from skidder.
(E) - Winch line arrives at log(s)
Hook Log
(B) - Winch line arrives at log(s)
(E) - Winch line starts in toward skidder.
Lateral Inhaul
(B) - Winch line starts in toward skidder.
(E) - Logs arrive at skidder.
Loaded Return to Landing
(B) - Logs arrive at skidder.
(E) -Skidder arrives at landing.
Unhook and deck logs
(B) - Skidder arrives at landing.
(E) - Skidder leaves landing.
Using the Skidding Cycle Element Time Study Form (Table B.1), we record a sample of cycles for a rubber-tired skidder.
For example, on cycle no. 1 a small rubber-tired skidder leaves the landing and travels 200 meters in 1.5 minutes along the skid trail to the log pickup point. The operator turns and positions the skidder in 0.2 minutes. The helper pulls out the winch line 20 meters in 0.7 minutes. Two logs are hooked in 1.2 minutes, winched to the skid trail in 1.0 minutes. The skidder returns to the landing in 3.0 minutes. The logs are unhooked and pushed into the deck and the skidder is positioned to leave the landing in 1.6 minutes. During cycle no. 3, the logs are picked up at two points during winching. During cycle no. 4, logs are picked up at two points along the skid trail.
Summing the times for each element, our estimates for the skidding coefficients are:
Unloaded Travel Speed = 1350 m/12.8 min = 105 m/min
Loaded Travel Speed = (1325 + 25) m/(18.9 + .3) min = 70 m/min
Lateral Outhaul Speed = 120 m/5.0 min = 24 m/min
Lateral Inhaul Speed = 120 m/6.2 min = 19 m/min
Position Skidder = 1.0 m/5 cycles = 0.20 min/trip
Hook Time = 13.5 min/5 cycles = 2.7 min/trip
Unhook and Deck = 8.7 min/5 cycles = 1.7 min/trip
Average number of logs per trip = 13 logs/5 cycles = 2.6 logs/trip
If the average log size is 0.5 cubic meters per log then the average load per trip is 2.6 logs per trip multiplied by 0.5 cubic meters per log or 1.3 cubic meters per trip.

<title>Cost Control in Forest Harvesting and Road Construction</title>
<section>1</section>
INTRODUCTION
In many countries, forestry and forest products constitute an important resource base. They also provide a substantial contribution to the national economy and form a significant part of the gross national product.
There is, however, increasing concern about the rapid decrease of resources, which is particularly pronounced in the tropical zone. Much of the destruction of these resources is attributed to the desperate need for more land on which to grow food and to uncontrolled logging practices.
In view of this situation, there is a need to intensify conservation-oriented appropriate utilization, ensuring a more responsible use of the available resources. Forests must be used without endangering their existence for future generations.
Ways and means must be sought to increase the efficiency and productivity of environmentally sound forest harvesting operations.
Forest operations are often of a very complex nature and need to take care of the environmental, social, economic, cultural and technical concerns in a given set of conditions.
This manual has been designed to assist harvesting managers in calculating costs rapidly and in evaluating various options involving different combinations of harvesting machines and systems. It covers all levels of mechanization, ranging from basic to intermediate and advanced machinery.
It is hoped that the manual will contribute to enhancing economic viability and productivity in forest operations by identifying possible cost reductions through appropriate cost control and evaluation, and optimizing harvesting, transport and road construction costs.
The program has been designed by Dr. J. Sessions, Professor of Forest Engineering at the College of Forestry, Oregon State University, USA and programmed by J.B. Sessions.
The project was supervised by R. Heinrich, Chief of the Forest Harvesting and Transport Branch, Forest Products Division.

SUMMARY
This manual provides harvesting managers and consultants with a simple and rapid method of identifying the effects of changing key variables which may affect harvesting costs. These key variables may include local prices of equipment, local labor costs, skidding distances, skidding speeds, load size, skidding pattern, and road costs.
The manual begins with an introduction to the principles of cost control, introduces breakeven concepts and cost equations. Then, the details of cost calculations for machine rates are presented, followed by production equations and unit cost derivations for road construction and harvesting.
A computerized system (PACE) for calculation of machine rates, road construction costs, and harvesting costs is introduced with user instructions and examples. A disk for IBM microcomputers and compatibles is included along with example data files.
The appendices include simplified procedures for equipment cost collection and field production studies.

1. PRINCIPLES OF COST CONTROL
1.1 Introduction
1.2 Basic Classification of Costs
1.3 Total Cost and Unit-Cost Formulas
1.4 Breakeven Analysis
1.5 Minimum Cost Analyses
1.1 Introduction
Cost is important to all industry. Costs can be divided into two general classes; absolute costs and relative costs. Absolute cost measures the loss in value of assets. Relative cost involves a comparison between the chosen course of action and the course of action that was rejected. This cost of the alternative action - the action not taken - is often called the "opportunity cost".
The accountant is primarily concerned with the absolute cost. However, the forest engineer, the planner, the manager needs to be concerned with the alternative cost - the cost of the lost opportunity. Management has to be able to make comparisons between the policy that should be chosen and the policy that should be rejected. Such comparisons require the ability to predict costs, rather than merely record costs.
Cost data are, of course, essential to the technique of cost prediction. However, the form in which much cost data are recorded limits accurate cost prediction to the field of comparable situations only. This limitation of accurate cost prediction may not be serious in industries where the production environment changes little from month to month or year to year. In harvesting, however, identical production situations are the exception rather than the rule. Unless the cost data are broken down and recorded as unit costs, and correlated with the factors that control their values, they are of little use in deciding between alternative procedures. Here, the approach to the problem of useful cost data is that of identification, isolation, and control of the factors affecting cost.
1.2 Basic Classification of Costs
Costs are divided into two types: variable costs, and fixed costs. Variable costs vary per unit of production. For example, they may be the cost per cubic meter of wood yarded, per cubic meter of dirt excavated, etc. Fixed costs, on the other hand, are incurred only once and as additional units of production are produced, the unit costs fall. Examples of fixed costs would be equipment move-in costs and road access costs.
1.3 Total Cost and Unit-Cost Formulas
As harvesting operations become more complicated and involve both fixed and variable costs, there usually is more than one way to accomplish a given task. It may be possible to change the quantity of one or both types of cost, and thus to arrive at a minimum total cost. Mathematically, the relationship existing between volume of production and costs can be expressed by the following equations:
Total cost = fixed cost + variable cost × output
In symbols using the first letters of the cost elements and N for the output or number of units of production, these simple formulas are

1.4 Breakeven Analysis
A breakeven analysis determines the point at which one method becomes superior to another method of accomplishing some task or objective. Breakeven analysis is a common and important part of cost control.
One illustration of a breakeven analysis would be to compare two methods of road construction for a road that involves a limited amount of cut-and-fill earthwork. It would be possible to do the earthwork by hand or by bulldozer. If the manual method were adopted, the fixed costs would be low or non-existent. Payment would be done on a daily basis and would call for direct supervision by a foreman. The cost would be calculated by estimating the time required and multiplying this time by the average wages of the men employed. The men could also be paid on a piece-work basis. Alternatively, this work could be done by a bulldozer which would have to be moved in from another site. Let us assume that the cost of the hand labor would be $0.60 per cubic meter and the bulldozer would cost $0.40 per cubic meter and would require $100 to move in from another site. The move-in cost for the bulldozer is a fixed cost, and is independent of the quantity of the earthwork handled. If the
bulldozer is used, no economy will result unless the amount of earthwork is sufficient to carry the fixed cost plus the direct cost of the bulldozer operation.
Figure 1.1 Breakeven Example for Excavation.
If, on a set of coordinates, cost in dollars is plotted on the vertical axis and units of production on the horizontal axis, we can indicate fixed cost for any process by a horizontal line parallel to the x-axis. If variable cost per unit output is constant, then the total cost for any number of units of production will be the sum of the fixed cost and the variable cost multiplied by the number of units of production, or F + NV. If the cost data for two processes or methods, one of which has a higher variable cost, but lower fixed cost than the other are plotted on the same graph, the total cost lines will intersect at some point. At this point the levels of production and total cost are the same. This point is known as the "breakeven" point, since at this level one method is as economical as the other. Referring to Figure 1.1 the breakeven point at which quantity the bulldozer alternative and the manual labor alternative become equal is at 500 cubic meters. We could have
found this same result algebraically by writing F + NV = F' + NV' where F and V are the fixed and variable costs for the manual method, and F' and V' are the corresponding values for the bulldozer method. Since all values are known except N, we can solve for N using the formula N = (F' - F) / (V - V')
1.5 Minimum Cost Analyses
A similar, but different problem is the determination of the point of minimum total cost. Instead of balancing two methods with different fixed and variable costs, the aim is to bring the sum of two costs to a minimum. We will assume a clearing crew of 20 men is clearing road right-of-way and the following facts are available:
1. Men are paid at the rate of $0.40 per hour.
2. Time is measured from the time of leaving camp to the time of return.
3. Total walking time per man is increasing at the rate of 15 minutes per day.
4. The cost to move the camp is $50.
If the camp is moved each day, no time is lost walking, but the camp cost is $50 per day. If the camp is not moved, on the second day 15 crew-minutes are lost or $2.00. On the third day, the total walking time has increased 30 minutes, the fourth day, 45 minutes, and so on. How often should the camp be moved assuming all other things are equal? We could derive an algebraic expression using the sum of an arithmetic series if we wanted to solve this problem a number of times, but for demonstration purposes we can simply calculate the average total camp cost. The average total camp cost is the sum of the average daily cost of walking time plus the average daily cost of moving camp. If we moved camp each day, then average daily cost of walking time would be zero and the cost of moving camp would be $50.00. If we moved the camp every other day, the cost of walking time is $2.00 lost the second day, or an average of $1.00 per day. The average daily cost of moving camp is $50
divided by 2 or $25.00. The average total camp cost is then $26.00. If we continued this process for various numbers of days the camp remains in location, we would obtain the results in Table 1.1.
TABLE 1.1 Average daily total camp cost as the sum of the cost of walking time plus the cost of moving camp.

We see the average daily cost of walking time increasing linearly and the average cost of moving camp decreasing as the number of day
