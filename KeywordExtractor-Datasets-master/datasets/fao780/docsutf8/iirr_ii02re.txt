<section>Workshop background, objectives and process</section>
A workshop on upland management
This information kit was produced through a workshop at the International Institute of Rural Reconstruction (IIRR) from 29 August to 9 September 1994.
The workshop was organized by IIRR and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, with the Asia-Pacific Agroforestry Network (APAN, based in Bogor, Indonesia) and the Regional Office for Asia and the Pacific (RAPA, Bangkok) taking the lead on FAO's behalf.
A group of more than 30 men and women were drawn from government agencies, nongovernment organizations, universities and international groups in China, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam. They worked closely with the workshop organizers and the IIRR production team of editors, artists and desktop publishing staff.
The workshop developed this set of information and training materials on sustainable approaches to agriculture and natural resources management in the uplands. These materials are aimed at extension specialists from government and nongovernment organizations throughout the region.
Workshop objectives
The workshop stressed three "Ps" process, participation and product. The workshop idea grew from discussions between IIRR and FAO staff during a consultation with NGOs held in September 1993 in Bangkok at the FAO-RAPA.
Three primary objectives were recognized:
· to expose participants to a consultative and participatory process for producing useful information on upland management
· to maximize participation and harness the experiences, interdisciplinary knowledge and creative and analytical powers of the diverse group of participants and organizers
· to produce an information kit that can easily be adapted and translated into local media and languages for specific training and extension purposes and tailored to particular user groups.
Southeast Asian countries face increasing population, deforestation, soil erosion and underdevelopment. Logging and illegal clearing for farming have already destroyed the forests in much of the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam. Papua New Guinea and the larger islands of Indonesia have some of the few remaining areas of rain forest in the region.
Unsuitable farming practices and natural resource exploitation are causing serious degradation in the uplands. Rising populations and low crop yields force farmers to clear yet more land. Meanwhile, the eroded soil clogs reservoirs and make rivers downstream shallow, resulting in flooding in the lowlands.
Improved farming and natural resource management help solve this problem. Simple strategies, such as hedgerows of nitrogen-fixing trees planted across the slope, can slow erosion and maintain soil fertility. Growing a combination of crops, livestock, trees and fish can raise farm incomes and reduce the need to clear new land. At the same time, policy and institutional support is urgently needed to improve agriculture and natural resources management and to strengthen the decisionmaking process of farm households
The workshop process
The workshop used a process developed by IIRR. This process has been used to produce information kits on a range of topics related to agriculture and natural resources management, including agroforestry technologies in the Philippines and Ghana, integrated agriculture aquaculture in Asia, ethnoveterinary medicine and environmental concepts and actions. (For a full list of such kits, contact IIRR.)
In February 1994, a list of potential topics was developed and resource persons were identified to develop first drafts on each topic, using guidelines provided.
During the workshop itself in August 1994, each participant presented his or her draft paper, using overhead transparencies of each page. Copies of each draft were also given to all other participants, who critiqued the draft and suggested revisions.
After the first presentation, an editor-artist team helped the author revise and edit the draft and draw illustrations to accompany the text The edited draft and artwork were then desktop-published to produce a second draft.
Each participant then presented his or her revised draft to the group for a second time, also using transparencies. Again, the audience critiqued it and suggested revisions. After the presentation, the editors, artists and desktop publishing staff again helped the author to revise it and develop a third draft.
Toward the end of the workshop, the third draft was made available to the participants for final comments and revisions. On the last day of the workshop, the participants worked in country groups to brainstorm and develop follow-up plans to adapt and use the information kit in their own countries.
The workshop allowed inputs from all participants to be incorporated, taking advantage of the diverse experience and expertise of all present. The concentration of resource persons, editors, artists and desktop publishing resources at one time and place enabled materials to be produced more quickly than is typical for similar publications. And the sharing of experiences among participants allowed the development of networks that would continue to be fruitful long into the future and lead to concrete follow-up activities in the countries concerned.

<section>How to use, adapt and evaluate this kit</section>
This technical information kit is designed for use by agriculture and forestry trainers, extension subject-matter specialists and government agencies and NGOs focusing on agriculture and natural resource management in the uplands of Southeast Asia. The material draws on a range of experiences from institutions and individuals in the region.
No collection of material can claim to be perfect or comprehensive and this effort makes no such claim. However, the materials presented lend themselves to adaptations for specific user groups, languages, local media and purposes. The ideas and experiences presented in each of the topics emphasize principles, approaches and methods, not detailed technologies.
The topics presented in the kit are based on a systems approach to analysis of key resource management concerns in upland communities of Southeast Asia. The systems approach is applied in the design and development of appropriate program interventions. This approach acknowledges that farm households are systems experts and that their local knowledge, needs and experiences must become the basis for program development.
Chapter contents
The kit is divided into six chapters (plus appendices), with several topics presented in each chapter. Many topics are interrelated or overlap, this is a deliberate attempt to highlight key messages. Chapter 1 outlines several important concerns confronting upland communities of the region and attempts to summarize some strategies which may be widely applied. Chapter 2 describes and analyzes examples of upland farming and natural resource management practices and systems from Southeast Asia. Chapter 3 briefly describes a range of soil and water conservation methods used in Southeast Asia, their advantages and limitations and factors affecting their adoption.
Chapter 4 presents a range of diagnostic methods and tools for appraising and assessing human, natural and financial resources available for use by upland households and communities.
Chapter 5 discusses the importance of support services (e.g., extension, research, marketing and rural enterprise development) which can (1) increase the effectiveness of upland systems when present, or (2) limit the sustainability of the systems when absent.
How the material can be used
· As a reference material and a 'menu of options'' to use in developing program strategies and designing interventions
· As a training material for agriculture/forestry extension personnel
· As an English-language prototype that can be translated, adapted and revised for each country of the region.
Chapter 6 presents several methods for evaluating and measuring the impact of upland development programs. Financial, biophysical, social and sustainability indicators are discussed and analyzed. The appendices compile additional resource information, glossaries and detailed information about the workshop participants and their institutions.
Example of how four topics in the kit can be used in a logical sequence. Outputs from one topic can be treated as inputs into the next. However, the same four topics may be used alone or in a different order if the situation requires.
Basket approach
The various chapters present a "basket" of program strategies; they are not intended to represent a "blueprint,, approach. Each of the strategies will be appropriate and relevant based on the local circumstances. However, many of the strategies represented as topics can be used in a logical programming sequence.
Much of the material in the kit focuses on the development and implementation of upland farming systems using a natural resource management strategy. Within these topics, a distinction is made between agroforestry "systems" and soil and water conservation "practices,,' recognizing that many of the "systems', combine several "practices,,, therefore involving some degree of overlap. However the agroforestry systems information (Chapter 2) focuses more on the tree-crop interactions, while the practices information (Chapter 3) focuses more on component technologies and how they might be integrated into existing systems.
It is extremely difficult transfer whole systems from one area to another without some degree of adaptation. Equally unsuccessful have been attempts, over the years, to train extension personnel to extend an entire farming system. A more appropriate strategy is the development and promotion of systems components which allow flexibility to farm households to mix-and-match components most relevant to their particular resource base and needs.
Format
The format of the kit was chosen by the workshop participants based on the advantages that it offers: (1) it is large enough to be clear and easy to use; (2) the standard size allows for easy photocopying and sharing Given that the contents of many topics are interrelated, crossreferences are given when appropriate; for instance, see Levels of decision-making.
Evaluation
This material can be evaluated in various ways. Examples include:
· Monitoring the adaptation, use and distribution within the AsiaPacific Agroforestry Network and other networks and partners
· Using a formal evaluation survey, which could be initiated before country-level adaptations are undertaken
· Obtaining feedback from users of the kit.
Follow-up
On the last day of the two-week workshop, the participants discussed and developed follow-up action plans. Some of the key elements of those plans are presented below:
· In Indonesia, the materials will be used for training and extension (with some adaptation) by government agricultural offices and agricultural polytechnics and universities.
· In Vietnam, the materials will be used to provide a general framework for upland area development projects, with a focus on the learning, planning, and monitoring and evaluation aspects of program implementation.
· There was interest to translate and adapt the materials by several of the country groups, including Thailand, Indonesia and Vietnam. Additionally, both the China and Vietnam groups made requests to receive diskette copies of the publication in order to facilitate translation and adaptation.
· All the country groups discussed the distribution of the kit to strategic institutions or individuals within their respective countries.
· In the Philippines, a national consultation for a training-of-trainers was conceptualized in order to assess how the material could be used by existing trainers within the Department of Environment and Natural Resources, the Department of Agriculture, local government units and NGOs. The Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program---Integrated Social Forestry Program was specifically mentioned as a potential user of the material.
<section>1. Overview of upland issues and approaches</section>
<section>Upland development issues and approaches</section>
The uplands of Southeast Asia contrast with the region's lowlands. They are hilly or mountainous areas, with steep slopes and generally poor soils. While dryland agriculture is most common, the uplands also contain areas of wetland rice where the topography permits irrigation.
The uplands form a significant portion of most countries in the region: they account for 80% of Indonesia's, 70% of China's and 72% of Vietnam's total land area. Because of their varied topography and poor soils, the uplands sustain lower populations than the more fertile lowlands: only 26% of Vietnam's population lives in upland areas.
How can integrated, participatory approaches which balance economic and ecological considerations be translated into agricultural development and natural resource management models that can be understood by extension workers and adopted by farmers?
Links between uplands and lowlands
· Population movements.
· Upper watersheds regulate water flow further downstream.
· Erosion causes siltation and flooding downstream.
· Lowlands provide markets for uplands.
· Government policies determined in lowlands, often by lowland inhabitants.

Characteristics of the uplands
Two features characterize the region's uplands: diversity and change.
Diversity
· The varied topography results in wide variations in soil types and fertility, microclimate and vegetation over short distances.
· Steep slopes and deep ravines make agriculture, transport, communication and the provision of infrastructure difficult.
· Farming systems are complex, with hundreds of different species and varieties of crops grown.
· The uplands are home to the majority of the region's ethnic minorities. For instance:
- 2 million people belonging to 54 ethnic groups in the uplands of Vietnam.
- 1 million members of hill tribes in northern Thailand.
· The people in the uplands use a wealth of indigenous techniques, developed and tested over centuries, that can be a valuable resource for development.
· Diversified, socioeconomic, cultural and agroecological conditions.
· Diversified ethnic groups.
· Competition to manage natural resources among individuals, villages, firms, government and NGOs.
Change
· Deforestation through logging is rapid, opening up land for cultivation.
· Shifting cultivation is sustainable where low population densities allow long fallow periods, but results in erosion, soil depletion and declining yields where rising populations force farmers to shorten fallows.
· The overexploitation and depletion of natural resources result in nonsustainable production systems.
· Farming systems are changing from a predominantly subsistence basis to the increasing importance of crops and livestock raised for cash
· Upland areas in Vietnam, Laos and the Philippines are recovering from the effects of war and civil unrest.
· Land uses are changing from forest to agricultural land and agricultural land to settlement.
Problems in the uplands
· Degradation of natural resources (soil, water, forests). Soil and water erosion affects an area of 1.79 million km² in China, causing a loss of more than 5 billion tons of soil annually. The nutrients contained in the lost soil are equivalent to 50 million tons of chemical fertilizers.
· Changes in climate, biophysical conditions, population and technology, affecting the natural resource carrying capacity and social and economic development
· Land tenure
· Farmers' limited technical skills
· Marketing of agricultural products
· Gaps in agricultural production processes, marketing and industry in terms of regulations, technology, human resources and physical infrastructure
· Gender issues.
Note: Some of these problems may also be severe in lowland areas.
Population
Some of the region's uplands are densely populated: Examples are the highlands of Java and the midland region of northern Vietnam. Such areas typically have more fertile soils or are near densely populated lowland areas. Others, such as much of Borneo and Papua New Guinea, are lightly populated.
The population in the uplands is increasing. These areas are experiencing movements of people in two different directions:
· Young people in the uplands are moving to the cities in search of employment, leaving children and the elderly in the villages. This results in critical shortages of labor during planting and harvesting.
· At the same time, people from the lowlands are moving into upland areas in search of cultivable land. Often, these newcomers use inappropriate farming techniques. They also bring different cultural values from the traditional ethnic groups in the hills. They clash with local people for the ownership of land that has traditionally been farmed on a shifting cultivation basis by the ethnic minorities.
Natural growth and migration from the lowlands mean that upland populations are rising, forcing farmers to cultivate steeper slopes and poorer soils and to leave land fallow for shorter periods. This exacerbates the problems of erosion, soil fertility and water conservation. Many upland areas suffer from severe erosion: 40% of the Jratunseluna watershed in Central Java is degraded.
Complex relationships
Farmers, extensionists and researchers must consider many factors:
· biophysical (soil, water, trees, pests, slope, climate, etc.)
· social (individuals, households, labor, education, skills, etc.)
· economic (credit, commodity prices, etc.).
The complex relationships among these factors help determine the existing farming system and the range of opportunities open to farmers --and the types of soil and water conservation measures they are likely to be able to implement. (See also Levels of decision-making.)
Components, not technology packages
The diversity of the uplands means it is impossible to apply single solutions or unified packages of technologies to agricultural problems in the uplands. Rather than trying to design and promote whole-farm systems, experience has shown it is more useful develop and promote components of systems. Farmers can then choose from a "menu" of technologies--some indigenous, some introduced and some a result of a blend of indigenous and introduced technologies. They can select and adapt those technologies that best suit their own unique needs.
Research and extension approaches
The diversity of ecosystems, culture and languages also makes research and extension work difficult. Research institutions have generally focused on lowland areas, to the relative neglect of the uplands. Much of this research has been of marginal relevance to problems faced by upland farmers, partly because of poor linkages between research, extension and farmers. In addition, relevant research findings have not been widely disseminated to extension services and farmers.
Extension services in the uplands are generally weak, with a few, underqualified and poorly paid staff required to cover large areas. Conventional research and extension approaches are clearly unsuited in these conditions. Various alternatives have been tested in the uplands, emphasizing participatory approaches to develop productive, sustainable farming systems. These approaches include participatory technology development, farmer-to-farmer extension and farming systems development.
Integrated, participatory approaches
Many agricultural development and natural resources management programs have been very specific in their disciplinary approach, commodity and farming systems orientation. Program orientations have sometimes ignored local conditions, basic community needs and the need for human development. integrated, participatory approaches are needed to ensure that interventions address local problems and are sustainable. New programs seek to increase productivity yet minimize environmental destruction and try to improve the quality of the environment. These programs are integrated and diversified to ensure balance between economic and ecological considerations. The uplands are the focus of several major government programs and smallscale, innovative approaches, often implemented by NGOs.

<section>People's participation</section>
People are central to the use and management of resources. People use resources for livelihood. People need these resources for their wants. People use these resources for their luxury.
People's participation is a prerequisite to community-based natural resource management. It is central to a people-centered, sustainable development approach and is a continuous, interactive process.
Participation means that people become the stakeholders and decision-makers. Participation must not be induced or co-opted. People must be the subjects, not the objects of development initiatives. Participation is the essence of responsible stewardship of natural resources.
Participation is not easy.
People's participation requires organization, Interaction, consensusbuilding, decision-making and conflict resolution.
Community-based natural resources management The community-based natural resources management approach is an ongoing, collective initiative by the community to manage its natural resources. It includes eight components.
1 Educate and build awareness.
· Natural resources are the base for food production.
· Natural resources are part of the global life-support system.
· These resources must be used sustainably. (See Indicators of sustainability.)
· It is our civic duty to use, conserve and protect natural resources.
2 Promote sustainable farming and resource use.
· Research and develop sustainable farming and resource use.
· Ensure participation of farm communities.
· Create partnerships among farmers, extensionists and researchers. (See Research-extension-farmer linkages.)
· Respect and build on indigenous knowledge. (See Building on indigenous knowledge. )
3 Conserve and protect sensitive ecosystems.
The community and local government should work together to identify ways to conserve and protect sensitive ecosystems.
Criteria for selecting ecosystems:
· Importance of the ecosystem to local livelihood.
· Biological diversity and uniqueness.
· Contribution to the life-support chain and local culture.
4 Enhance regenerative capacity of natural resources.
· Identify ways to stop destruction and pollution of natural resources.
· Promote the regenerative.capacity of resources (e.g., tree planting, composting) to prevent erosion. (See Integrated land-use planning in upland areas.)
5 Promote gender equity and participation.
Integrated development programs must ensure women's participation and empowerment. (See Gender analysis.)
6 Ensure indigenous and minority interests.
Indigenous people and other minorities have been robbed of their natural resource base. Their survival is threatened.
· Ensure the continued use of resources for the survival of minorities and their cultural practices.
7 Address transboundary issues.
One community can be affected by activities in another community or by pollution from outside. For example, several communities may share a river or beach.
· Develop mechanisms to deal with transboundary concerns.
· Find ways to internalize production costs.
8 Networking and linkage support.
· Provide training to respond to community needs.
· Link the community with support agencies, universities and NGOs.
· Collaborate with other organizations. (See Resource institutions.)
Implementing community-based natural resources management
1 Selection of site and collaborators
· Identify communities.
· Identify collaborating NGOs or community organizations.
2 Capacity-building
· Train collaborators to mobilize people's participation.
· Train in sustainable approaches to natural resource management.
3 Community visioning
· Undertake a community visioning with the local leaders, government agencies and officials, women and youth.
4 Understanding the situation
· Assess the local situation. (See Participatory appraisal methods. )
· Study government plans and interventions.
5 Participatory planning
· Assist key community leaders to plan activities.
· Validate the plans with as many groups as possible (e.g., women, youth, indigenous people).
6 Implementation
· Collaborating group (NGO or people's organization) undertakes implementation.
· Involve as many local organized groups as possible.
· Ensure that ownership of the project is transferred to the community.
7 Participatory monitoring and evaluation
· Regularly monitor activities.
· Discuss activities with the participants to evaluate successes and weaknesses.
<section>Levels of decision-making</section>
Agriculture and natural resources management systems are made up of social, biophysical and economic systems. They must be viewed at different levels: from the individual farmer and household, up through the community to the national and international levels. These levels are interrelated and affect each other in various ways.
Decision-makers
Different people or organizations make decisions at the various levels. At the farm level, individual members of the farm household (male, female, young, old) make key decisions. The household is the most important decision-making unit in many settings. At the community level, local leaders (both formal and informal) are important. The cultural norms and traditional practices of ethnic groups may also determine the activities of a family or an individual.
Individuals and groups make decisions after considering many factors--social, biophysical and economic (see General systems overview). The perceived risk involved is a major influence. Decision-makers may take a short-term or a long-term view.
Decisions made at one level can affect that level and the lower levels. For example, an individual farmer can decide what crops to plant and this will affect his or her income and the types of pest problems in the field.
Individual decision-makers at one level do not normally affect what happens at higher levels. For instance, an individual farmer's cropping practices do not have a major impact on the amount of soil erosion in a river catchment or on the market price of the crop. However, farmers can have an impact on erosion or price if a large number of individuals make the same decisions, either deliberately (as in a cooperative) or because of external factors (as when they respond to price increases).
Empowerment--a key to sustainable development--means enabling farmers and other rural people to make decisions that affect them, both at their own level and (through community organizations) at higher levels.
Systems
Production and decision-making are affected by social, biophysical and economic systems in a given area. These systems are complex and interrelated, leaving farmers with large numbers of choices. An understanding of the many factors and the relationships among them is key to helping farmers make informed decisions. To do this, researchers and extensionists must have a broad understanding of various issues. Frequently, a multidisplinary approach to research is needed. (See General systems overview.)
Social
Social elements include the farmer (male and female, young and old), the household and community. Each of these units has certain characteristics, skills, needs, priorities and rules.
Some social factors, such as management skills, can be changed through training or experience. Others, such as family size, change only in the long run.
