1. INTRODUCTION
The Aquaculture Development and Coordination Programme (ADCP) is an Inter-Regional Project funded by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), executed by FAO, and based in Rome.
One of its tasks is to coordinate and provide technical and operational assistance for a number of regional aquaculture programmes. These include programmes in Africa (based in Nigeria), Asia (based in Thailand, with other centres in India, the Philippines and the People's Republic of China), and Latin America (in Brazil), all financed by UNDP and bilateral organizations.
The fourth of the current programmes is the Mediterranean Regional Aquaculture Programme (MEDRAP) headquartered in Tunisia. MEDRAP began in 1984 and is set up to assist in the operation of demonstration and pilot projects in the participating countries^1 which border on the Mediterranean. In addition, through the bilateral support of the Italian Government, MEDRAP carries out training in aquaculture including short-term sessions, study tours, and the implementation of a regional training centre for aquaculture technicians at Policoro in southern Italy on a commercial fish farm.
^1 The participating countries in MEDRAP at the time of the workshop were Algeria, Cyprus, Egypt, Greece, Malta, Morocco, Portugal, Syria, Tunisia, Turkey and Yugoslavia.
ADCP, as part of its mandate to communicate information to advise and direct investment in aquaculture, is concentrating its attention on several non-biotechnical activities in aquaculture development which have so far been neglected. In the more advanced aquaculture regions, such as the Mediterranean and South-East Asia, the major constraints to further aquaculture development are no longer solely bio-technical - i.e., problems associated with the biological and environmental requirements for maintaining aquatic species in captivity. The main constraints are centred now around such sectoral topics as policy-making and planning, aquabusiness management, socio-anthropology, socio-economics, and, probably most important of all, the processing and marketing of aquaculture products.
The following report summarises the findings of the first of a series of workshops on the marketing of prime aquaculture species and their links with investment which ADCP will be organizing. This first workshop deals with the prime Mediterranean species - sea bass, sea bream, mullets and eel.
ADCP's objectives in holding this workshop were (i) to obtain marketing information on the four most important Mediterranean fish species, and (ii) to assist ADCP in advising and guiding investment in the industry by both the public and the private sectors. Almost all the Mediterranean countries have an interest in aquaculture, either to compensate for the diminishing fisheries resources of the region or to provide additional food for their increasing populations. Most of the countries which rim the Mediterranean are focusing on the same prime high-value species with the same international or national markets in view. ADCP feels that it has a responsibility to try to prevent over-investment in aquaculture in the region or, to put it another way, to provide the best information to allow investors to make appropriate decisions, whatever their priorities may be.
ADCP, as a result of the workshop held in December 1986, has therefore summarised information which can be used by:
- Assistance agencies, which might be asked to support an aquaculture project in one of the developing countries in the region;
- Development banks, which might be asked to finance large-scale construction, e.g., a large farm or hatchery;
- Governments, which might need to make planning decisions on the use of coastal resources, or
- Potential investors, who might wish to invest their own money in aquaculture enterprises.

2. FISH CONSUMPTION AND PRODUCTION IN MEDITERRANEAN COUNTRIES
2.1 Sea bass and sea bream
2.2 Eel
2.3 Mullets
In 1984 total domestic landings in the Mediterranean area was 4 048 281 tons (Table 1). Imports accounted for about 46% of the total, while exports were about 19%. Apparent consumption was 5 128 596 tons. Total fish trade in the area showed a deficit of 1 080 315 tons, i.e. about 27% of total landings.
In terms of fish trade balance, among the countries examined during the workshop, only Morocco, Turkey and Tunisia showed positive figures. France, Italy and Yugoslavia had the largest deficits; in combination their share of the total fish trade balance was about 80%.
France, Spain and Morocco were by far the largest exporters; their combined share of total exports was about 70%. Exports from Turkey and Tunisia were limited, but mainly concentrated on high value species.
The principal importing countries were France, Italy and Spain, whose combined share of total imports in the area was about 68%. Algeria, Greece and Portugal showed a more limited dependence on imports, but the quantities of fish imported, in the range of 46 000 to 108 000 tons, were relatively high.
Self sufficiency in sea fish proteins was dramatically limited in many areas. Syria, Egypt, Cyprus, and Yugoslavia showed the lowest levels of self-sufficiency, from 6% for Syria to 21% for Yugoslavia (Table 1).
Lack of fish obviously has a negative impact on per caput consumption level. The per caput levels in Yugoslavia, Cyprus and Egypt are reported to be only 3.1 kg, 3.8 kg and 4.9 kg respectively (Table 2). Participants in the workshop were not able to provide a complete profile of the major species consumed in each country. However, it is well known that consumption in Algeria, Egypt and Yugoslavia is mainly based on low-value species resulting from the strong requirement for fish protein.

2.1 Sea bass and sea bream
In many countries sea bass and sea bream consumption is generally related to their local production availability. Consumers do not always attach the same value to these species; consequently fishermen do not always catch them. In any case, a share of total production is internally consumed. Whenever quantities of sea bass and sea bream are large enough, each country tends to develop an export trade directed mainly towards Italy. Spain, France and Greece are also interesting markets for these species.
In this regard, a representative example is given by Tunisia, whose total sea bass and sea bream production was 740 tons in 1986 (Table 5). This is mainly consumed internally even though prices are relatively high. Local wholesale prices in 1986 were reported to be T.Din. 5.4-8.6 (US$ 6.3-10.0)/kg for sea bass and from T.Din. 3.9-6.9 (US$ 4.5-8.0)/kg for sea bream. It is anticipated that the proportion of aquaculture production exported will increase from about 16% in 1987 to 67% by 1992 (Table 6) because of the recent relaxation of government controls.
The position in Greece and Turkey is similar. In both countries, consumption of sea bass and sea bream is steadily increasing. Greek consumers are reported to choose these two species more and more, even though prices are continuously increasing. Prices at December 1986 for these two species, according to the marketing channel utilized, varied from Gr.Dr. 700 to 1 600 (US$ 5.0-11.4)/kg. A major part of the Greek fish trade deficit is reported to be caused by the increasing consumption of prime quality products. In many countries, prices of imported sea bass and sea bream are lower than those of locally produced fish.
Production of sea bass and sea bream in Turkey is increasing because of internal and external demand pressures. At the moment prices are still well under the European average and, at retail level, they are reported to be US$ 6.25 for sea bass and US$ 6.00 for sea bream. Until a few years ago internal demand was low; consequently the interest of fishermen was also limited. Given the consequential under-exploitation of stocks in open seas or lagoons, it can be predicted that production could readily expand in the near future.
Even though prices are higher, production in Cyprus is reported to be following the same pattern as in Turkey. Current retail market prices for sea bass and sea bream were about US$ 12.48/kg in 1986. Demand for sea bass began only when wholesale prices were listed on the market.
Participants agreed that expansion of sea bass and sea bream production in the Mediterranean, either for internal consumption or for export markets, was feasible. Given that sea bass and sea bream final consumption patterns show different absorption capacities, and that they are a small share of each country's total fish consumption, participants agreed that production expansion should be smooth to avoid heavy falls or fluctuations in prices which could result in negative effects on both aquaculture production and fishermen's incomes.
2.2 Eel
In the southern Mediterranean rim countries there is little eel consumption. With the exception of Egypt, where about 500 tons of eel are consumed, these countries export the major part of their eel production to Germany, the Netherlands and Italy, where markets are stabilized and well structured.
In many countries the main concern is for elver production and trade. In addition to the trade of elvers for restocking and grow-out in fish farms, there is evidence of elvers being utilized as fresh food in some regions, e.g., Italy and Morocco. Because of the shortage of juvenile eels many countries are now showing concern and some, e.g. Turkey, have forbidden the catch and sale of elvers. As a result of the shortage prices have increased steadily. French production is reported to be about 500 t per year. Despite the normal price of F.F. 200/kg (US$ 30.4) during 1986, the market price in December reached F.F. 350/kg (US$ 53.2).
2.3 Mullets
Mullet production is widespread in the Mediterranean area. Consumers accept the product almost everywhere. Because of the relatively low value of these species there is little evidence of trade. Greece is among the few countries which is currently reported to import mullet from France and Turkey. Turkish consumers do not show any specific interest in these species. Tunisia produces about 1 800 t of mullets; all are consumed domestically. Demand for large size mullets has increased during recent years because of the production of 'bottarga' which is made from mullet eggs.

3. ACTUAL AND POTENTIAL PRODUCTION OF PRIME SPECIES
Participants gave their estimates of current national production of market-sized fish and their expectations for growth in the sector. This information is summarised in Tables 3 and 4. Details of the information presented verbally at the workshop are given in Annex 1.
Partial or complete estimates of current and projected aquaculture production were obtained for 11 countries - Cyprus, Egypt, France, Greece, Italy, Morocco, Portugal, Spain, Tunisia, Turkey and Yugoslavia. It is emphasized that the data given in Tables 3 and 4 are the combined estimates of those participating and are not intended to stand as official statistics.
Amongst the countries represented, only Egypt, Italy and Tunisia expected to increase the production of mullets substantially through extensive aquaculture in the next five years. Aquaculture production of mullets in the region may rise by 85% from about 11 000 in 1985 to about 20 400 t in 1992, mainly because of a forecast rise of 7 000 t per year in Italian production. Egyptian production was expected to double and Tunisian production to quadruple.
Eel production was expected to grow by nearly 4 000 t per year to about 10 700 t per year between 1985 and 1992, representing an increase of about 58%.
A substantial increase in the production of sea bream and sea bass was forecast. Current production in the countries represented at the workshop was about 6 000 t per year. This is expected to increase to over 27 000 t per year by 1992, 4.5 times the level in 1985/6. Workshop participants therefore expected that more than 21 000 t per year extra sea bass/sea bream will be produced annually by 1992, compared with the current situation. Estimates (Table 5) of current total production (fisheries and aquaculture) of these species were incomplete, but a rough calculation based on the figures provided indicated that, assuming fisheries production stagnates, aquaculture may nearly double the current availability of sea bass and sea bream from the region within six years. One participant felt that these estimates were conservative. The marketing implications of this are discussed in section 4 of this report.

4. TRADE AND MARKETING OF PRIME AQUACULTURE SPECIES IN MEDITERRANEAN COUNTRIES
4.1 Future production and exports
4.2 Marketing development needs
4.1 Future production and exports
Estimates for future production of sea bass, sea bream, mullets and eels according to domestic or export destination, are presented in Table 6. These estimates, for the years 1987 and 1992, support a tentative assumption that the present production of sea bass and bream for export is about 40% of that marketed domestically. In five years time production for export may increase to about 80% of that destined for domestic consumption. Spain, Tunisia and Turkey could be the countries with the most significant increase in production for export. This increase in the availability of exportable quantities (in the order of 9 000-10 000 t per year), which would almost exclusively aim at the Italian market, would result in considerable pressure on present price levels and could lead to market collapse due to lack of coordination. It should be noted that the Italian production is expected to increase by about 4 300 t per year. Thus, available supplies on the Italian market could
increase from about 5 000 t in 1987 to 19 000 t in 1992.

The only country identified which exports mullet from (extensive) aquaculture production is Turkey. It is estimated that the amount exported will decrease from 2 900 t (1987) to 2 600 t (1992). The workshop participants expect a doubling in cultured mullet for domestic markets, mostly due to anticipated substantial increases in Italian production, but no particular marketing problems are foreseen, at least not on an international scale.
The production increase of cultured eel for domestic markets is rather modest, except in Italy, where an increase of 1 000 t per year was forecast between 1987 and 1992. Total increase expected in all other countries is only 235 t per year. Production of eel for export on the other hand, is expected to experience a more pronounced growth of about 2 400 t, an increase of about 75% above present eel production for export. Italy, Greece, Egypt, Portugal and Tunisia are the countries principally responsible for these additional quantities becoming available for the markets in the Netherlands and Federal Republic of Germany. The group agreed that these markets should be able to absorb these additional quantities but it would be desirable to watch market developments closely, in particular competing production.
In summary, the consensus was that no marketing or trade problems were to be expected with mullet; that Mediterranean producers should monitor developments in export markets for eel, and that marketing and trade could become critical for the future viability of sea bass and sea bream culture.
4.2 Marketing development needs
The markets for eel show very specific product requirements. The opinion was expressed that, in the future, consumption of smoked eel may increase at the expense of fresh consumption, but total demand for eel may not grow as fast as production. Market developments should therefore be monitored, particularly in Denmark, Federal Republic of Germany and the Netherlands. The feasibility of promoting preserved eel products (smoked, marinated) should be investigated if necessary.
There was considerable discussion regarding market expectations for sea bass and sea bream. Reference was made to salmon particularly as a demonstration of the potential advantages of duly recognizing marketing requirements, and of the dangers of marketing sea bass and sea bream in an erratic and uncoordinated way. Examples of price falls for sea bream of 50%, due to a minor over-supply and the market situation for fresh Norwegian farmed salmon in Paris in November 1986, were noted. It was strongly advocated that every effort should be made to push farmed sea bream into the present primary position of salmon in the expensive restaurant trade. The idea behind this is the promotion of a typically Mediterranean product, which carries the positive associations of summer and recreation, and which is already appreciated in Italy and France. Table 7 gives a summary of survey results referring to servings of fish dishes in 70 high class restaurants on the French Mediterranean coast,
and showed that choice of sea bass increases with increased menu price (as do salmon and sole but to a lesser extent).

In addition the large number of product markets and prices, related to the variations between sea bream varieties of different geographical origin, was mentioned as making the market (which actually consisted of a number of small markets) rigid and inflexible. However, there were also examples of hitherto unknown species such as Argentinian besugo replacing sea bream (at US$ 8.00-9.00/kg, airfreighted fresh on ice from Mar del Plata to Milan), possibly at a level of 15 t per month.
The requirements of the supermarket trade in respect of uniformity of sizes and standardization of packs were highlighted as well as the advantage of portion size compared with off-sized and over-sized fish for the restaurant trade.

5. INTERMEDIARY GOODS AND SERVICES AS PART OF INVESTMENT IN AQUACULTURE - ANALYSIS AND TRENDS IN PRODUCTION COSTS
5.1 Feeds
5.2 Fry
5.3 Other aspects
The role played by intermediary goods and services in terms of strengthening and developing the aquaculture industry was recognized by all the participants. Discussion of this topic concentrated on sea bass and sea bream farming. All participants felt that much of the fish farmers' and researchers' concern should be directed toward two main areas:
- the development of proper diets which would improve food conversion efficiency and decrease the incidence of diseases which are prevalent on grow-out farms and hatcheries;
- technological developments to increase the survival rate of hatchery reared sea bass and sea bream fingerlings.
All participants agreed that these two areas were the most important as together they represented about 55% of total production costs.
5.1 Feeds
Sea bass/bream feed prices were not quantified by type or quality but were reported to be US$ 1.06/kg for fry feed in Cyprus. Grow-out feeds were reported to be F.F. 5/kg (US$ 0.76) in France, US$ I/kg in Greece, Lit. 1 300/kg (US$ 0.93) in Italy, US$ 0.70/kg in Portugal and Pts. 135/kg (US$ 0.99) in Spain. Eel feed was stated to be US$ 0.70/kg in Portugal. Sea bass/bream feed represents only about one percent of total European fish feed sales. Currently about 1 500 t per year of sea bass/bream feeds, all sold in the Mediterranean, are produced by the one manufacturer present. This was said to be about 50% of the total market for these products.
A comparison of the benefits of dry and wet feeds was proposed by one representative. Even though more expensive, dry feed has shown to be easier to handle, easier to automate, more consistent in quality, and produces better growth. On the other hand, wet feed is cheaper and can be prepared on site; but labour utilization is greater, there being many difficulties in handling, automatic feeding and consistency. Most participants showed greater preference for the utilization of dry feed, especially in intensive fish farming. Feed quality was recognized as the most important requisite for good fish production.
Feed costs as a proportion of total production costs on grow-out farms varies from 27 to 33% (Table 8). One participant noted that this percentage is still low when compared with the salmon and chicken farming industries where feed costs are as high as 45-55% and 60-65% of total production costs respectively.
Even though improvements in feed quality are foreseen, it was generally thought that decreases in unit costs were unlikely.
5.2 Fry
In Cyprus there are two sea bass/bream hatcheries, mainly oriented towards an export market. The capacity of these hatcheries is 2 million juveniles per year while current output is about 170 000 per year. There are at least 10 hatcheries in Italy which are estimated to produce a total of 6 million juveniles annually. France has five hatcheries, with a capacity of 6 million juveniles per year; about 1 million per year are produced now. In Greece only one hatchery is currently operational. Its current output equals its capacity at 1.8 million juveniles annually. Spain has four hatcheries with a capacity and current output of 6 million juveniles per year. Tunisia has two public hatcheries intended for research and one private hatchery about which no information was available. Hatchery production is not yet started in Portugal or Turkey. It is thought there is little opportunity for the development of 'backyard' hatcheries for sea bass and sea bream, particularly because of the
need to maintain large brood fish.
Mullet fry were reported to be priced, according to species and seasonality, from Lit. 30 to 130 (US$ 0.02-0.09) each in Italy^1 in 1986. Elvers were reported to cost US$ 26-30/kg in France, rising to US$ 46 in December, while they were US$ 62/kg in Portugal and US$ 25-36/kg in Italy.^1
^1 S. Cataudella (pers.comm.)
Hatchery-reared sea bass juveniles were reported to be F.F. 3.5-5.9 (US$ 0.53-0.90) each in France according to size, while sea bream were F.F. 4.6-7.6 (US$ 0.70-1.15) each. Prices in Cyprus were reported to be US$ 0.60 each locally or US$ 0.65 for export. In Greece hatchery-reared juveniles were Gr.Dr. 80 (US$ 0.57) each for bass and Gr.Dr. 100 (US$ 0.71) each for bream. In Portugal sea bass juveniles collected from the wild were US$ 0.35 each. Hatchery-reared sea bass and sea bream juveniles in Spain were Pts. 80 (US$ 0.59) and 100 (US$ 0.74) each respectively in 1986. In Italy fry cost up to Lit. 1 200 (US$ 0.86) each depending on size.

All participants showed great concern about the need to increase the current Mediterranean production of sea bass and sea bream juveniles. In fact, since each country represented in the workshop plans many aquaculture investment programmes for the production of these two species, shortages of juveniles could become one of the greatest bottlenecks in further development. This imbalance between demand and supply, which is already being experienced, could result in unreasonably high juvenile prices and limit the potential production capacity of individual fish farms. Participants felt that shortage of juveniles could cause unpredictable effects for Mediterranean producers in economic and productive terms. Wild fry were said to be abundant only in Portugal and Turkey which have not yet experienced intensive fish farming.
Juvenile costs as a proportion of total grow-out costs vary from 23 to 29% (Table 8). Some participants stated that profit margins on hatchery-reared sea bass and sea bream juveniles are as high as 25-28%. It follows that increases in supply and improvements in technology, which could lower the mortality rate, may result in a lower international price for juveniles.
5.3 Other aspects
While biological improvements made life easier for fish farmers, participants believed that developments in other areas were not taking place in parallel. Anaesthetics and other chemicals required before and after fish handling, automatic feeders with spreaders to avoid feed wastage, and technical improvements related to cage construction, were given as examples of topics requiring priority attention.
A major concern of participants were the difficulties encountered by private investors in obtaining rights over areas where fish farms could be established. Producers present at the workshop also stressed the difficulties encountered in getting the necessary public services such as licences, energy, telephones, telex, etc. Fish farms are almost always isolated from the community.
The workshop believed that solutions to the problems and difficulties discussed would lower production costs and make intensive fish farming less vulnerable to falls in product value. Production costs of three cage farming units were presented. Two farms were in Greece and the third was located near Trieste, Italy (Table 8). The figures presented revealed that production technology has reached a substantial homogenity. Differences in cost breakdown were attributed to specific management variants. One of the Greek farms and the Italian farm produce their own juveniles while the other Greek farm is still at an experimental stage. However, total feed and seed costs varied only between 53 to 57% of total production costs.
Subsequent discussion was then concentrated on the possibility of reducing margins 15-20% to meet a decreasing trend in market prices. Prices may drop due to the lower production costs of extensive farming systems; Mediterranean production from this source is expected to rise, resulting in greater competition for intensive farmers.
Average production costs and profit of a traditional 'valle' system of northern Italy were provided by one participant (Table 9) to provide an indication of the production costs of extensive aquaculture. Total production was estimated to be 100 kg/ha; about 50% was mullet, the remaining 50% being equally distributed between sea bass and sea bream.^1 Gross profit was estimated at nearly 20%.
^1 In 1983 official Greek statistics reported that, in Messologhi and Amvrakikos lagoons, production of sea bream was 49.2 and 41.2% of total catch respectively, while for sea bass it was 7.8 and 28% However, in other Greek lagoons there was a much lower percentage of high value species.
