<title>ADCP/REP/89/44 - A Review of Extension Methodologies in Aquaculture</title>
<section>1</section>
FOREWORD
An Expert Consultation on Planning for Aquaculture Development, organized by the ADCP in Policoro, Italy in 1988 (see ADCP/REP/89/33), identified an integrated set of opportunities for technical assistance to developing countries. These were predominantly a group of needs or ideas which collectively would assist in guiding investment decisions, primarily at the national level in both the public and private sectors.
One of the needs identified by the participants to better local infrastructure in support of producers was to improve ways of delivering appropriate extension information, particularly when new technology was involved. Countries which have large numbers of small-scale farmers were specifically requiring such help, especially those in Africa.
The Consultation noted, "that extension was an important interface between national producers and advancing technology. All current national projects involved in production had a component of extension, and this practice must be continued. Extension was a national function (and in many cases local) because of the diversity of aquaculture practices, languages, environment, and social and economic conditions. One immediate action at the national level was to seek wider involvement of agriculturists, particularly agriculture extension workers, to provide channels for improving the promotion of aquaculture in rural populations. However, support to the improvement of national extension could also be provided at the regional and sub-regional level to (i) organize and provide appropriate training for extension leaders at focal centres, (ii) transmit information about the concepts and importance of extension to senior management in government administrations through sensitization
seminars, and (iii) assist in the translation of extension materials to national languages, and even local dialects."
The Consultation also proposed appropriate actions at the interregional level, specifically to (i) examine and analyse known effective extension services, and catalogue, (ii) explore new approaches to extension, and (iii) disseminate new information to the regions. To the first of these ends, "A Review of Extension Methodologies" was commissioned by ADCP, and prepared by Carole R. Engle and Nathan M. Stone. It is intended to be a background document for future regional workshops which might explore new approaches to extension and subsequently produce new information for development. The document is also intended as a resource paper for training courses.

1. INTRODUCTION
1.1 The Role and Purpose of Extension in Aquaculture
1.2 The Role of Government Policy in Development of Extension Methodologies
Agricultural extension is now recognized as a potent and critical force in the development process. It has been defined as "a service or system which assists farm people through educational procedures in improving farming methods and techniques, increasing production efficiency and income, bettering their levels of living, and lifting the social and educational standards of rural life." (Maunder, 1973).
Functions generally attributed to agricultural extension include "to communicate agricultural research findings and recommendations to farm people, and to bring farm people into contact with sources of practical and useful information through organized group action". Activities of extension involve "agents working with farmers to teach improved farming practices, new techniques, and more productive or more efficient technologies ... organized within a system with administrative direction and support." (Axinn, 1988).
The structure, goals, strategies, and organization of any extension system vary with the multitude of sectoral goals and objectives of national governments. Therefore, any particular extension system reflects the underlying culture, philosophies, and priorities of the political, economic, and social environment in which it evolved.
The primary objective of this document is to present and discuss alternative aquaculture extension methodologies, strategies, techniques, and organizational structures. The intent is not necessarily to provide an all-encompassing census of extension systems, but rather to bring the principal issues to the fore. It is hoped that this document will stimulate discussion and analysis of aquaculture extension systems in different countries in the search for effective and efficient technology transfer mechanisms to further development of the aquaculture sector around the world.
Various sources were used to compile information for this document, such as project documents, interviews, telephone calls, and a survey instrument (Annex 1). The data from the survey represent the experience and opinions of those responding, and their help is gratefully acknowledged. Those who provided more specific information are cited. The document and the information it contains does not pretend to be a global encyclopaedia of aquaculture extension, but rather a vehicle for encouraging further thought and analysis of this most essential component of aquaculture development.
1.1 The Role and Purpose of Extension in Aquaculture
Aquaculture is a new technology in many parts of the world, while in others it is a well developed tradition. Such differences affect the scope and nature of extension efforts among different nations.
The primary purpose of aquaculture extension is to improve production of aquatic organisms for food and wealth for farmers, as well as for the nation as a whole. Extension programmes are justified by the fact that economic development resulting from extension activities should more than compensate for the national investment required to provide these services.
Extension activities can be divided into three primary functions:
(i) education,
(ii) services, and
(iii) liaison between government agencies, universities, and producers.
In some cases, aquaculture extension programmes include additional duties.
Education is often thought of as the primary function of extension activities. Extension programmes are designed to teach producers new technologies developed through research, and can take many forms. For example, extension agents may hold formal workshops, conferences, or producers' meetings to present new information. Agents also work one-on-one with individual producers, groups of producers, or cooperatives. Demonstration ponds may be developed on a particular farm to show to other farmers in the area the viability of a particular new aquaculture technology.
Many aquaculture extension programmes provide services to farmers. Some provide production inputs, such as fingerlings or transportation for feed; others build ponds for farmers, and those which target subsistence or semi-subsistence farmers may provide credit. In some cases, these services may be quite technical and consist of disease and water quality diagnoses,
The third primary function of extension programmes is a role of liaison with other government and private institutions. Extension agents provide an important link between researchers and farmers. In most cases researchers are not adequately skilled in communicating with farmers and frequently do not have the regular contact with farmers needed to transfer technologies effectively. Extension agents provide this important link. Finally, agents often coordinate contacts with other government organizations which provide health, housing, credit, or other services to the farmers.
1.2 The Role of Government Policy in Development of Extension Methodologies
Government policies and philosophies determine the structure of extension activities, the type of activities undertaken, and identify the target group. For example, some countries place great emphasis on rural development and programmes designed to improve the standard of living of rural poor; others place primary emphasis on industrial development or large-scale agriculture to stimulate economic development which may provide significant benefits to society as a whole. Extension is therefore matched accordingly.
At times this is not always easy. For example, one important source of funding for extension services in developing countries is international technical assistance from multilateral and bilateral donors. However, the criteria set by the philosophies and goals of the host country and donor agency are often in conflict. A nation which places emphasis on food security may put priority on projects designed to improve the quality of produce consumed by the farm family. The value of products consumed in the home alone, however, is generally insufficient to satisfy donor requirements of acceptable financial rates of return (Molnar and Duncan, 1989).
These varying philosophies of government (and donor) on the process of development dictate which groups of people are targeted or affected by extension efforts. The manner in which extension is subsequently carried out depends consequently upon the characteristics of the target groups.

2. TARGET GROUPS
2.1 Private Producers
2.2 Cooperatives
2.3 Subsistence Producers
2.4 Selection of Target Groups
The selection of target groups for extension programmes often results in a highly emotional debate. Selection is generally determined by government policy, although government policy does not always represent the attitudes and philosophies of all individuals in society.
Selection of target groups may precipitate debates which range from ideological/philosophical posturings to pragmatic assessments of a nation's capability of providing extension services dictated by a particular philosophy. Extension services represent a large investment with returns occurring over the long-term. Rarely are returns immediate in nature. Budgetary resources may not permit the level of investment which a sense of moral obligation to strive for social justice may require.
Who will be the beneficiaries of the aquacultural extension system? Target groups can be identified and categorized in several ways. In many countries policy debates are common on whether to carry out extension with the purpose of maintaining low consumer prices, or helping rural producers to achieve higher standards of living through higher prices for their commodities.
Aquaculture projects often specify goals of enhancing rural incomes, nutrition, and overall food security for smallholders (Ben-Yami, 1987). At the other end of the spectrum the need for foreign exchange (which can be obtained by export of high-value commodities such as salmon and shrimp) has resulted in capital-intensive aquaculture systems for large-scale commercial producers (Bailey, 1988).
A second policy issue revolves around emphasis on private producers or cooperatives. Often the argument is phrased as a decision to work primarily with large- or small-scale farmers. This decision is closely related to national philosophies on economic development strategies.
2.1 Private Producers
Some countries identify private producers as the targets for extension activities. Private producers are defined in this document as farmers who work for themselves, receive benefits from their management and control of the aquaculture enterprise, and assume the consequences of any wrong decision. Private producers can be small-scale farmers working individually, or large-scale commercialized farmers. The common denominators are the private ownership and management control of the farm pond(s).
Private producers have strong incentives to adopt those technologies which will benefit them the most, and from which a tangible reward can be obtained for their efforts. The challenge to extension, in general, is to demonstrate effectively to farmers the benefits of any proposed technology, and to ensure adequate feedback from farmers as to its on-farm feasibility.
Private producers can be difficult to work with if farms are small, isolated, and difficult to reach. In these cases extension agents may invest enormous amounts of energy, fuel, and effort to visit remote areas with relatively little time to work directly with the farmer. Ambitious programmes, which call for working and attending to large numbers of such farmers, may place unrealistic demands on both the energy of extension agents and transportation resources of many countries. Some countries have developed ingenious methods of handling these types of situations; for example, see the case studies for Rwanda (Section 4.4.2) and Zaïre (4.4.3).
On the other hand many large producers provide a different set of problems for extension programmes. For example, large producers may be more educated than extension agents and consider them poorly trained, and some purposely try to avoid extension agents if they fear that the agent may communicate their production secrets to other farmers.
Despite these difficulties, the trend in aquaculture extension has been to move away from emphasis on group and cooperative efforts to services for private producers. Efforts to encourage community and group aquaculture projects have generally met with little success.
2.2 Cooperatives
Many development efforts of international assistance agencies have been oriented towards cooperative groups. In this approach individuals are not favoured with special privileges, and extension resources are used efficiently by working with a group of people rather than one person at a time.
The investment required in both capital and labour to construct fish ponds has been the basis for encouraging cooperative or group efforts in aquaculture. For example, instead of 10 small ponds constructed at high cost per water surface area, one large pond could be constructed at a much lower cost and would supply the same number of people with fish. Moreover, one large pond requires only one good site, while 10 small ponds require 10 good sites. Individual subsistence farmers may have insufficent land to set aside part for a fish pond, but the government may be willing to provide land to a group of farmers for an aquaculture project.
However, grouping farmers is not always easy. For example, cooperative efforts in Panama appeared to be hindered by the organizational complexity related to socio-economic inequality, existing cattle ranching operations, and divisions between members and non-members (Lovshin et al., 1986). But younger, married, and relatively well-informed men with large households were especially attracted to group fish culture projects.
Socio-economic homogeneity, and socially esteemed and influential leaders (but not rich) are factors which contribute to the success of group projects. Nevertheless, many cooperative groups have not functioned well. In general cooperatives are short-lived, but there have been exceptions. The basic problem is to provide adequate incentives for farmers to share the workload. Inevitably some individuals work harder than others, and become disgruntled when those who do not work as hard receive the same benefits as they do. In fish production it is especially difficult to determine whether an individual has contributed his or her share of work, or if he or she has harvested more than a fair share. In cases where cooperatives have been successful, there is generally a strong and highly-respected leader who has been able to maintain unity. If this person leaves, however, the cooperative usually fails.
2.3 Subsistence Producers
A common debate in development philosophy related to extension is whether to work directly with the poorest people, or to work with wealthier farmers and hope that the technology "trickles down" to lower economic strata. In societies which are highly stratified in economic and social terms, choosing to work only with the wealthier class prevents the technology from reaching the poorer strata. In practice the "trickle down" theory rarely works.
In 1979 the World Conference on Agrarian Reform and Rural Development declared that "... most development efforts have not yet succeeded in satisfying the aspirations of peoples and their basic requirements consistent with principles of human dignity and international social justice and solidarity, especially in the rural areas of developing countries. Rural development strategies can realize their full potential only through the motivations, active involvement, and organization at the grass-roots level of rural people, with special emphasis on the least advantaged." (FAO, 1981).
Efforts directed towards the "poorest of the poor" meet with enormous obstacles. Many of the world's farmers are landless or tenants. Poverty itself indicates a very low level of resources to work with to provide both food and income for the family.
It is far easier to work with people who have a certain level of resources which at least permits them to provide some amount of surplus production to accumulate capital or other resources. However, if the participants in a project are all extremely wealthy the technology may be perceived as one which is only appropriate for the upper economic strata.
In some cases the expressed target group may be subsistence farmers, while in fact the majority of extension efforts are devoted to larger-scale producers. If donor agencies insist on funding only projects devoted to subsistence producers then there is a strong incentive to state them as the target group whether or not this is based on reality.
2.4 Selection of Target Groups
The types of extension strategies selected depend to a large degree on the target groups selected. Selection of target groups may be, in some cases, by default and not through a conscious effort, and strategies effective for one group may not work for another.
An effective extension programme designed to service large-scale commercial producers should be managed differently from one designed to work primarily with subsistence producers. This paper will attempt to draw from the experiences of various nations, and identify which extension responsibilities, strategies, methods, and organizational structures have been most effective for different target groups and different government objectives.
Table 1 presents data of respondents to the survey instrument (Annex I) on the types of groups targeted by aquaculture extension programmes in a number of countries and regions. With the exception of the Philippines, Panama, and Uruguay, commercial producers were not the targeted group of aquaculture extension efforts. This may be due largely to reasons expressed by several respondents that private producers actually had more advanced technology than researchers or extension agents. Large companies, particularly shrimp farmers, either hire researchers and have developed their own proprietary technology on private research stations, or fund university or government research. In the Philippines respondents from projects of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), colleges, and universities indicated that extension programmes did not target commercial producers, while the Inland Resources Development Corporation worked primarily with private commercial
concerns.
Subsistence producers are most often targeted by aquaculture extension efforts. All countries responding, except Ecuador and Uruguay, targeted subsistence producers. Approximately half of the respondents indicated that cooperatives were targeted, while approximately two-thirds targeted private producers. Four of the countries responding (the Philippines, Ecuador, Mexico, and Uruguay) targeted both private and cooperative producers.
Regardless of the target group, careful selection of individual cooperators is of great importance, especially in the early stages of a programme where there is a need to demonstrate that the production technology is sound. Extension theory classifies personality types according to an individual's propensity to adopt new ideas and technologies. Individuals are classified as (a) innovators, (b) early adopters, (c) late adopters, and (d) laggards.
In this scheme extension theory says that early adopters are the best contact persons for extension personnel. Innovators may be too far ahead of what is practical at a certain point in time, and may be seen as unusual or extreme. Early adopters are, on the other hand, interested in new ideas, but are also respected by neighbours and more likely to be perceived as resembling them. While laggards probably have the greatest need, they generally are the least likely to change and adopt new technologies. Extension theory maintains that the greatest long-term effect will occur if extension activities focus on early adopters. If the likelihood of adopting change is low, extension resources may not be well spent and overall change may be slow.

3.6 Advantages and Disadvantages of Different Extension Responsibilities
3.1 Education
The primary responsibility of extension personnel world-wide is that of education. Technology transfer is an educational process orchestrated by extension personnel through both formal and informal means.
Formal education by extension personnel takes the form of workshops designed to focus on specific topics, conferences, seminars, and producer meetings. Extension personnel also engage in in-service training of extension agents who are responsible for day-to-day contact with producers. These formal education sessions may focus on a wide array of different topics, from specific management practices to more general technical theories of relationships between stocking and harvest size, and even oxygen fluctuations in ponds and disease diagnosis.

Extension personnel also spend a great deal of time in informal education through farm visits. For example, good extension personnel who get a first-hand view of farm operations can often notice potential problems, and even discuss particular difficulties of an individual's ponds. Farm visits also provide farmers with the opportunity to ask questions on different topics, problems, and issues which are not covered in formal seminars.
Farm-level demonstrations are techniques of informal education in which the extension agent demonstrates a particular technique to improve farm operations for an individual or group of farmers. Hands-on training and education, working side by side with farmers, is an effective albeit time-consuming means to transfer technology.
Educational activities also include dissemination of information to producers and consumers, through, for example, newsletters, newspaper articles, television and radio broadcasts, and utilization of other media. Specific technologies or techniques may also be presented at fairs, markets, and other public gatherings. Printed materials in the form of popular magazines or comics, manuals, bulletins, fact sheets, and books, all contribute to the educational process.
Almost all (87%) of the countries responding to the survey utilized formal education methods (see Table 2).
Only two countries (Colombia and Uruguay) indicated that they did not have organized extension services for aquaculture. All but one country (Uruguay) utilized informal education methods. Uruguay is a country with little aquaculture extension.
3.2 Diagnostic Services
Extension services for the agriculture sector invariably establish and provide technical services; for example, seed and soil testing services. These services may be free, charged at cost, or operated for a profit. Most aquaculture extension services provide water quality diagnostic services. Extension agents are often provided with a water-test kit as part of their standard equipment. Basic parameters for water quality can be analyzed to identify its suitability for raising fish, or other aquatic organisms, and to determine the need and quantity of lime and fertilizer. Extension agents with water test kits also have the capability to provide advice on water quality problems related to pond fertility, oxygen, and management.
Many extension services provide disease diagnostic services and recommend treatments to aquaculture producers. This service becomes important in areas where aquaculture has reached industrial levels of production. Most disease and water quality problems originate in extremely fertile ponds as a result of high rates of feeding. In many countries the lack of production inputs for fish farming, such as feed and inorganic fertilizers, results in low pond fertility, and hence production. For most extensive systems, with low levels of production, disease problems are rarely significant and do not justify investment in a laboratory and equipment for disease diagnosis.

In rural areas transport and communications are such problems that diagnostic services are not practical. Most disease or water quality problems require a quick response. By the time the agent arrives at the pond, the problem and symptoms may be past. In such situations there is virtually no need for disease or even extensive water quality diagnostic services.
3.3 Supply of Production Inputs
Some countries provide production inputs to new and aspiring aquaculture producers. The decision to supply or not to supply these inputs is most often dictated by overall prevailing political philosophies. For example, in some countries development strategies are based on the concept that the government is responsible for providing all essential inputs. This is often the case where individual producers have extremely limited resources.
Farmers participating in development projects may have difficulty arranging transportation for production inputs. Extension agents often are assigned transportation, and use it to transport materials to farmers on regular visits. For example, feed for livestock (pigs and poultry) which produce manure to fertilize fish ponds may be transported by extension agents.
Only five of the 15 countries responding transported production inputs to fish farmers (see Table 2). The five were Rwanda, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe (in Africa), Thailand (Asia), and Panama (Latin America). In many of these countries transportation itself is often difficult, and fuel shortages are commonplace, particularly for the government sector. These factors drastically restrict the functioning of government programmes.
Six of the 15 countries responding (Cameroon, Rwanda, Zimbabwe, Thailand, Colombia, and Guatemala) indicated that, as a rule, production inputs were supplied to fish farmers. Three of these (Cameroon, Zimbabwe, and Guatemala) specified that the only input was fish seed.
Fingerling production requires a higher level of management than grow-out. New fish farmers lack the required level of management skills to produce their own fingerlings successfully and reliably. Fingerlings may also represent a substantial cost for subsistence or semi-subsistence farmers.
Many nations have developed a policy of supplying fingerlings to producers participating in government projects. The rationale involves a somewhat paternalistic attitude that poor farmers cannot afford to purchase their own seed, and that on-farm seed production is difficult to achieve. Seed distribution is also a quantifiable means of justifying a government station, personnel, and other facilities, and therefore the need for fish seed may be used as a tool by politicians to lobby for hatcheries in their home regions. The pressure to justify the existence of hatcheries may also result in production of "paper" or "book" fish, instead of accurate accounts of fingerlings harvested and distributed.
If government hatcheries consistently supply seed to producers at no charge, the producers may become dependent on the government. Free seed from the government may prevent development of a fingerling production industry and may hinder the growth of a viable aquaculture sector.
Panama has an explicit policy of selling fingerlings at production cost, and encouraging farmers to produce their own seed on farm (Lovshin et al, 1986). Aquaculture development experts believe that the first step towards a viable sector is to transfer seed production technology to farmers who possess adequate resources and conditions (Torrans, 1989).
In Liberia government hatcheries have been transferred to the private sector and are operated by private entrepreneurs (Avault, 1984; Torrans, 1988). While government capital was used originally to construct the seed production infrastructure, government management preferred the greater efficiency afforded by private producers. The same policy has been practised by many developed countries.
Fish culture projects may provide capital to construct fish ponds. In some cases capital is represented by equipment to construct ponds, and may or may not include materials needed for pipework or water supply structures. In Liberia the Nimba County Rural Development Project furnishes the "monk" (the drain unit for the pond) and free fingerlings. The farmer provides the labour for pond construction, and rice bran for feeding (Avault, 1984).
In Panama the Ministry of Agricultural Development (or military units) generally provides bulldozers for earthmoving. Project participants provide labour, housing, and food for the bulldozer operators, diesel fuel for the bulldozer, and all other materials needed to construct the ponds.
The practice of providing production inputs to fish farmers is controversial. It is generally easier for the extension agent to supply seed rather than train farmers to produce their own. On the other hand, government funding for hatcheries may not be reliable, transport needed to deliver the fingerlings may break down, or there may be innumerable other problems, all of which prevent the necessary materials from arriving at the production site when needed, or delivery of fingerlings at the critical time. Farmers who rely on the government to provide these services do not, in general, develop alternative sources of supply or transportation. If government infrastructure breaks down, as it often does, farmers simply do not have the inputs when needed, and production consequently suffers. In practice, dependency on the responsibility of the government to supply production inputs is often cited as a major cause of failure of aquaculture projects (Torrans, 1989).
3.4 Product Promotion
Some countries with low annual per caput rates of fish consumption may develop extension programmes with activities to encourage consumption of fish. Such programmes, which are common in Latin America, may include distribution of recipes, radio advertisements, demonstrations of preparation methods for fish, and facts on nutritional qualities of fish.
There are several other suitable extension activites used to promote farm products, especially marketing. For example, in Mexico fish markets have been constructed at each fish station to sell production. Nicaragua has mobile vendors to sell fish purchased by the government from fishermen and fish farmers, and eight fish sales modules were constructed in Bolivia in 1988 (Centre de Desarrollo Pesquero, 1989). The government invested in these modules to improve sanitary conditions of fish markets, enhance the appearance of fish and fish products, and to stimulate changes in consumer habits.
3.5 Enforcing Regulations
In some countries, particularly those in which aquaculture functions are
