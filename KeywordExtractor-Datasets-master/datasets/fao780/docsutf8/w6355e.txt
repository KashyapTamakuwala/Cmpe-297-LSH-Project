<title>Compendium of Food Additive Specifications. Addendum 5. (FAO Food and Nutrition Paper - 52 Add. 5)</title>
<section>1</section>
INTRODUCTION
This volume contains specifications of identity and purity prepared at the forty-ninth meeting of the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA), held in Rome, 17-26 June 1997. These specifications should be considered only in conjunction with the Report of the above meeting which will be printed in the WHO Technical Report Series. Toxicological monographs of the substances considered at the 49th meeting of JECFA will be published in the WHO Food Additives Series as No. 40.
The general principles applied in the elaboration of specifications established at the earlier JECFA sessions have been published in the Principles for the Safety Assessment of Food Additives and Contaminants in Food, WHO Environmental Health Criteria, No. 70, 1987. The specifications of identity and purity of food additives established by JECFA are meant to identify the substance that has been subject to biological testing, to ensure that the substance is of adequate degree of purity for safe use in food, and to reflect and encourage good manufacturing practices. These principles were last reaffirmed by the 39th session of JECFA in 1992.
The specifications are mainly established for the use of toxicologists and others concerned with the identity and purity of the substance. As agreed by JECFA at its twenty-sixth meeting, specifications may also be established prior to the eventual completion of toxicological evaluation, in certain cases, when the available toxicological data are inadequate or incomplete, and do not permit the establishment of full or temporary acceptable daily intakes (ADIs). References are made in individual specifications to some of the criteria that may be of interest in commerce, but they do not necessarily include all the requirements of interest to the commercial user. These specifications are not more stringent than is necessary to accomplish their purpose and should easily be attainable by the producing industries. The report of the twenty-third session gives the reasons why certain specifications are designated as "tentative".
There were a total of 204 specifications prepared at the 49th session of which 158 were new. Thirty-four specifications were designated as tentative. Specifications for anoxomer were withdrawn because the substance is no longer a product of commerce. Specifications for turmeric were withdrawn, because the Committee considered the substance as food. Specifications for enzyme-treated starches were included in the revised specifications for modified starches.
Comments and suggestions regarding this Volume are encouraged. Please send to Chief, Food Quality and Standards Service, Food and Nutrition Division, FAO, Via delle Terme di Caracalla, 00100 Rome, Italy.
NOTE: Use of italics in specifications refers to General Methods (Guide to JECFA Specifications), FAO Food and Nutrition Paper 5/Rev. 2 (1991), unless otherwise indicated or evident.

TESTS
a -Acetolactate decarboxylase activity
PRINCIPLE
The enzyme a -acetolactate decarboxylase (ALDC) decarboxylates a -acetolactate to produce acetoin. The resultant acetoin can be reacted with a mixture of naphthol and creatine, resulting in quantitative formation of a characteristic red colour.
APPARATUS
1. Spectrophotometer or equivalent capable of measuring optical density (absorbance) at 522 nm
2. Water bath, held at 30±1 °, containing test tube rack
3. Volumetric glassware
REAGENTS
1. MES buffer, 0.05M (pH = 6.0).
Dissolve 9.76 g of MES (2-(N-morpholino) ethanesulphonic acid) in approximately 900 ml of deionised water. Adjust pH to 6.0 ± 0.5 with 1 N NaOH. Transfer to a 1-litre volumetric flask and make to volume with deionised water. This solution may be kept for two weeks at room temperature.
2. Brij 35 solution, 15% w/v.
Dissolve 15.0 g of Brij 35 (polyoxyethylene lauryl ether, Atlas Chemie, BDH, or equivalent) in approximately 70 ml of deionised water, heating to 60° to aid dissolution. After cooling, transfer to a 100-ml volumetric flask and make to volume with deionised water. This solution should be stored in a refrigerator, and can be kept for up to two months.
3. MES/Brij 35/NaCl solution.
Dissolve 48.8 g of MES and 175.32 g of NaCl (AR grade) in approximately 4.5 litres of deionised water. Add 17 ml of 15% Brij 35 solution (see 2. above). Adjust pH to 6.0 ± 0.5 with 1 N NaOH. Transfer to a 5-litre volumetric flask and make to volume with deionised water. This solution may be kept for two weeks at room temperature.
4. a -Acetolactate substrate, 0.2% v/v.
Pipette 100 m l of ethyl-2-acetoxy-2-methylacetolactate into a 50 ml volumetric flask. Add 6.0 ml of 0.5 N NaOH to the flask and stir for 20 minutes. Add MES buffer (see 1. above) to bring the volume to approximately 40 ml. Adjust pH to 6.0 ± 0.5 with 0.5 N HCl. Make to volume with MES buffer (see 1. above). This substrate should be made just before use.
5. Naphthol/Creatine colour reagent.
Dissolve 5.00 g of 1-naphthol and 0.50 g of creatine in 1 N NaOH, make to volume with 1 N NaOH in a 500-ml volumetric flask. This colour reagent should be made fresh just before use and shielded from light as much as possible.
6. Acetoin stock solution, 1000 mg/l.
Dissolve 0.100 g of acetoin (3-hydroxy-2-butanone) in deionised water in a 100-ml volumetric flask. Make to volume with deionised water.
7. Acetoin standards.
Dilute 0, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, 6.0, and 8.0 ml of stock acetoin solution (see 6. above) to volume with deionised water in 100-ml volumetric flasks to give standard solutions of 0, 10, 20, 40, 60, and 80 mg/l of acetoin. These solution may be kept for two weeks stored in a refrigerator.
8. Enzyme solutions.
Test samples of the enzyme a -acetolactate decarboxylase (ALDC) are diluted with MES/Brij 35/NaCl solution (see 3. above). The exact dilution will need to be determined by experience and experimentation to give an enzyme concentration which produces a result within the range of the acetoin standards (see 7. above) under the conditions of the test.
PROCEDURE
Preparation of standard curve
Prepare a standard curve by treating the acetoin standards (7.) in the following manner:
Pipette 400 m l of the acetoin standard solutions into 10-ml plastic test tubes. Add 4.6 ml of colour reagent (5.) to each test tube, mix, and let the test tube stand at room temperature for exactly 40 minutes. At the end of this 40 minute period, place 0 mg/l acetoin standard in the spectrophotometer set to read absorbance at 522 nm and adjust absorbance reading to zero. Measure the absorbance of the remaining acetoin standards at 522 nm.
Determination of enzyme activity
Preheat enzyme solutions (see 8. above), MES buffer (see 1. above), and the substrate (see 4. above) in a water bath at 30± 1°C for approximately 10 minutes.
Four solutions must be prepared for each analysis:
1. Enzyme blank (B1). Pipette 200 m l of enzyme solution (8.) and 200 m l of MES buffer (1.) into a 10 ml plastic test tube. Mix, and immediately place the test tube back into the water bath.
2. Sample value (HI). Pipette 200 m l of enzyme solution (8.) and 200 m l of substrate (4.) into a 10 ml plastic test tube. Mix, and immediately place the test tube into the water bath.
3. Buffer blank (B2). Pipette 200 m l of MES buffer (1.) and 200 m l of MES/Brij 35/NaCl solution (3.) into a 10 ml plastic test tube. Mix, and immediately place the test tube into the water bath.
4. Buffer value (H2). Pipette 200 m l of MES/Brij 35/NaCl solution (3.) and 200 m l of substrate (4.) into a 10 ml plastic test tube. Mix, and immediately place the test tube into the water bath.
For each enzyme determination the test tubes, are prepared in the order: B1, H1, B2, H2.
Exactly 20 minutes after mixing of each of solutions B1, H1, B2, and H2, remove from water bath, add 4.6 ml of colour reagent (5.), mix and leave at room temperature for exactly 40 minutes. At the end of this 40 minute period measure the absorbance of the solutions at 522 nm on a spectrophotometer or equivalent previously adjusted so that the 0 mg/l acetoin standard gives an absorbance reading of zero.
CALCULATION
The activity of the ALDC enzyme is defined in terms of activity units where:
1 ADU (a -Acetolactate Decarboxylase Unit) = the amount of enzyme which, by decarboxylation of a -acetolactate produces 1 m mol of acetoin per minute under the test reaction conditions.
Plot optical density values at 522 nm for the acetoin standards against acetoin concentration (in mg acetoin/l) of the standard and generate a standard curve. Use the standard curve to convert the optical density measurements for solutions H1, B1, H2, and B2 to mg acetoin/l.
Where:
[H1], [B1], [H2], [B2] are the concentrations of acetoin in the respective solutions in mg/l
F is the final volume of enzyme solution, after dilutions, in millilitres
W is the weight of enzyme in volume F, in grams
The factor 0.0011351 contains:
· the conversion from mg acetoin/l to m mol acetoin/min
· the conversion for the actual volumes of substrate and enzyme solution used in the analysis.

TESTS
IDENTIFICATION TESTS
Gel formation with water
Prepare a 1.0% solution of the sample in boiling water in a flask and place the flask in water at 30° for 15 min. A firm, resistant gel is formed. Place the flask in water at 70° for 1 h, the gel is not molten. When heating the flask at higher temperature than 95°, gel is liquefied to form a clear solution.
Precipitate formation with ammonium sulfate solution
A warm (40°) 0.5% solution of the sample gives a precipitate with half its volume of a warm (40°) 40% ammonium sulfate solution. This test distinguishes agar from alginates, gum arabic, gum ghatti, karaya gum, pectin and tragacanth.
Precipitate formation with lead acetate solution
A warm 0.5% solution of the sample gives a precipitate with one fifth its volume of basic lead acetate TS. This test distinguishes agar from methyl cellulose.
Microscopy
Place a few fragments of unground agar or some powder on a slide and add some drops of water or chloral hydrate TS. When examined under a microscope, agar in water appears granular and somewhat filamentous. In chloral hydrate TS, the powdered agar appears more transparent than in water.
PURITY TESTS
Water absorption
Place 5 g of the sample in a 100-ml graduated cylinder, fill to the mark with water, mix, and allow to stand at 25° for 24 h. Pour the contents of the cylinder through moistened glass wool, allowing the water to drain into a second 100-ml graduated cylinder. Not more than 75 ml of water should be obtained.
Foreign insoluble matter
Boil 5 g of the sample with 500 ml of water and 12 ml of sulfuric acid under a reflux condenser for 2 h. Allow to cool and filter through a tared, fine, sintered glass crucible. Wash flask and filter with 50 ml of water, dry at 105° to constant weight and weigh. Calculate as percentage.
Starch and dextrins
To a warm (40°) 0.5% solution of the sample, add 2 drops of iodine TS. Where the drops fall, a red-violet colour appears. After mixing, the solution should be golden brown and not blue or reddish.
Gelatin and other proteins
To a warm (40°) 0.5% solution of the sample add 1 volume of warm (40°) picric acid TS. No turbidity should appear within 10 min.
METHOD OF ASSAY
Threshold gel concentration: Prepare serial dilutions of the sample with known solids content (0.15%, 0.20%, 0.25%, etc.) and place in tubes, 150 mm long by 16 mm internal diameter, stoppered at both ends. Cool for 1 h at 20-25°. Allow cylinders of gel to slide from the tubes to a level surface. The lowest concentration of gel that resists gravity without rupture for 5-30 sec is the threshold concentration of the sample.

Filter while hot through a tared Gooch crucible provided with a glass fibre filter (2.4 cm, No. 934 AH, Reeve Angel & Co., Clifton, N.Y., or equivalent filter). If slow filtration is caused by high viscosity of the sample solution, boil until the viscosity is reduced enough to permit filtration. Wash the crucible thoroughly with hot water, dry the crucible and its contents at 105º for 1 h, cool and weigh. Calculate as percentage of the dry weight.
METHOD OF ASSAY
Proceed as directed under Carbon Dioxide Determination by Decarboxylation in the General Methods. Each ml of 0.25 N sodium hydroxide consumed is equivalent to 5.5 mg of carbon dioxide (CO[2]) or 27.12 mg of ammonium alginate (equivalent weight 217).

To a 0.5% solution of the sample in sodium hydroxide TS add one-fifth of its volume of a 2.5% solution of calcium chloride. A voluminous, gelatinous precipitate is formed. This test distinguishes calcium alginate from gum arabic, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, carrageenan, gelatin, gum ghatti, karaya gum, carob bean gum, methyl cellulose and tragacanth gum.
Precipitate formation with ammonium sulphate
To a 0.5% solution of the sample in sodium hydroxide TS add one-half of its volume of a saturated solution of ammonium sulfate. No precipitate is formed. This test distinguishes calcium alginate from agar, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, carrageenan, de-esterified pectin, gelatin, carob bean gum, methyl cellulose and starch.
Test for alginate
Dissolve as completely as possible 0.01 g of the sample by shaking with 0.15 ml of 0.1 N sodium hydroxide and add 1 ml of acid ferric sulfate TS. Within 5 min, a cherry-red colour develops that finally becomes deep purple.
METHOD OF ASSAY
Proceed as directed under Carbon Dioxide Determination by Decarboxylation in the General Methods. Each ml of 0.25 N sodium hydroxide consumed is equivalent to 5.5 mg of carbon dioxide (CO[2]) or 27.38 mg of calcium alginate (equivalent weight 219).

PURITY TESTS
Water-insoluble matter
Weigh 5 g of the sample to the nearest mg, transfer into a 100-ml beaker and add 50 ml of water. Stir until all the sample appears to be completely dissolved. Filter through a Gooch crucible, tared to an accuracy of ± 0.2 mg. Rinse the beaker with 20 ml of water. Dry the crucible with its contents in a 60°-oven to constant weight. Cool in a desiccator, weigh, and calculate as percentage.
METHOD OF ASSAY
Dissolve in a beaker 2.5 g of the sample, weighed to the nearest mg, in 5 ml of hot dilute hydrochloric acid TS. Cool, transfer to a 250-ml volumetric flask, dilute to volume with water, and mix. Transfer 50 ml of the solution to a 400-ml beaker, add 100 ml of water, 25 ml of sodium hydroxide TS, 40 mg of murexide indicator preparation and 3 ml of naphthol green TS. An alternative indicator is hydroxynaphthol blue, of which 0.25 g is used. In this case the naphthol green TS is omitted. Titrate wit
