IRRIGATION INVESTMENT BRIEFS FOREWORD Investments in irrigation can contribute importantly to increased agricultural production and economic benefits if planned, implemented and operated satisfactorily. The range of options available for investments is generally wide and careful selection on technical and socio-economic grounds is required to ensure optimum returns from the investments on a sustainable basis. The following papers have been written over the past eight years in the course of providing assistance to developing countries in the preparation of World Bank-financed irrigation projects in various parts of the world. They cover topics which have arisen in the course of field work, including technical and economic issues discussed in the field and requiring clarification, and also record experiences on actual case situations. The papers have been issued individually and distributed to the project staff concerned. However, as much of the material is of wider interest, they are now being issued collectively for more general distribution. It must be emphasized that the papers do not aim to provide a systematic treatment of the subject of investment in irrigation (and drainage), although most of the key factors to be considered for investment are discussed. The papers may, however, provide, a useful source of reference for those engaged in this area. The papers have been reproduced in the original (unedited) form. The contribution and assistance of colleagues in preparation of the series is gratefully acknowledged. V. Branscheid FAO Investment Centre.

DETERMINING IRRIGATION DEVELOPMENT OPTIONS (September 1989) (A Case Study) Introduction.
Irrigation developments usually have multiple aims. Some of the most frequent are to reduce dependency on agricultural imports, to generate exports, to reduce fluctuations in output, to intensify production, to aid human survival in semi-arid areas in times of drought, to raise farmer incomes, to create employment, to keep parastatal or private contractors in work, or to raise political monuments. But all irrigation thing in common: they use scarce resources, whether these be natural (water, irrigable land), managerial, or financial. Furthermore much of the financial contribution of governments in the case of existing irrigation tends to be borrowed, hence must eventually be repaid.
Whatever the mix of economic and social aims to which a government gives ultimate priority in its irrigation strategy, it is therefore prudent when planning sub-sectoral development to estimate the economic efficiency of the use of the natural and financial resources which will be used. With such estimates, comparison can be made between irrigation alternatives, and with rainfed options if these exist. If at national level it is decided for social reasons to favour one of the less economically efficient forms of irrigation, the extra public cost of doing so can be identified. From the point of view of the national finance ministry or a potential lender, the justification for, and the economic implications of the overall programme which is eventually proposed for financing are made explicit. If changes or adjustments are considered necessary they can be negotiated on a rational and quantified basis.
In practice, few irrigation developments are based on such estimates as most irrigation planners do not have technical expertise to make a systematic review of the economic efficiency of all technical options when formulating a national irrigation strategy. This paper describes therefore, as an example, the methodology used to derive at such a strategy for the case of Malawi.
The Irrigation Setting.
The Government's objective was to expand irrigation from presently about 22,000 ha to 42,000 ha through implementation of a single 20,000 ha project. Even though land and water resources were plentiful for the proposed project it was in sharp contrast to the past small-scale public irrigation development. Furthermore, the physical infrastructure needed appeared fairly capital intensive and the managerial capacity of the irrigation agency.
For a different case ref. also to "Estimating the Economic Efficiency of Irrigation in the Case of Brazil", FAO/CP Working Paper, 1989/3.
to handle such a relative large scheme (being 50 times larger than the biggest in existence) insufficient. Since the irrigation potential of Malawi is more than 100,000 ha and spread throughout the country, investigations were made therefore as to what other options were available and at what cost. In addition, the limited managerial capacity needed to be considered for implementation and operation of the options. The outcome of the investigations had to be presented in such a way as to allow comparison among options and the proposed project of 20,000 ha. Technical Options and Their Cost.
During the course of the investigations, 12 additional options for development were identified. Their type, cost (in Malawi Kwatcha; US$1 = MK2.8), implementation and operational ease are shown below in Table 1 together with the data for the proposed 20,000 ha project. The total annual cost for the individual options in Table 1 column 3 where estimated in Table 2 for the gravity schemes and in Tables 3 and 4 for the pumping schemes. The annual recurrent cost to Government (column 4) (an important consideration if Government funds are limited) were estimated or taken from local experiences where possible. Information on implementation and operationable ease (columns 5 and 6) was derived from local and foreign experiences.

Economic Benefits.
The calculation of benefits was based on a "without irrigation" scenario of maize mono-cropping (one crop per year) and a "with irrigation" scenario of a rainy season maize crop supplemented by irrigation followed by a fully irrigated rice crop.
This cropping pattern had been selected despite its lower irrigation water use efficiency compared to growing rice during the rainy season and maize during the dry season in the belief that Malawi farmers would give preference to their staple maize crop during the rainy season and regard rice as a cash crop only. Maize yields were expected to increase from 1.15 t/ha to 2.5 t/ha. The net benefits of the rice crop facilitated by irrigation were fully attributed as incremental benefits to irrigation. However, based on knowledge of existing schemes and the lack of general experience with irrigation in Malawi it was considered prudent to assume only a 60% cropping intensity for the rice crop as a 20-year average. The analysis showed that the discounted benefits over a 20-year period at 12 per cent amounted to about MK9,000 (Table 5 and 6).
An additional incremental benefit from irrigation were expected to arise from vegetable cropping on 10% of 1 ha in the dry season. This was valued to a discounted MK1,500 over a 20-year period.
Farm budgets. Farm budgets for the cropping pattern used in the economic analysis showed that the gross returns per hectare of irrigation at the farm level were about MK630 per annum (Table 7). Adding a small vegetable plot on 1/10 ha, on-farm returns increased to approximately MK800 per annum/ha.

Ranking of Options 10. In order to devise an irrigation strategy the types of irrigation technologies that are economically viable needed to be identified given the incremental benefits to irrigation under Malawian conditions. The benefits calculated above were compared with the incremental costs of the various technological options discounted by the same factor of 12% over 20 years. This enabled the assessment of the amount that could be spent per hectare on irrigation over a 20-year project period and still achieve a rate of return of 12%. The thirteen different options of irrigation developments identified were then set out in order to increasing costs of irrigation per hectare (with some slight modification for considering recurrent cost implications and ease of implementation and operation), in order to facilitate the drawing of "cut off" lines below which technologies were not viable. This was a major element in devising the recommended strategy. The ranking is shown in Table 8.

Selection of Options 11. From Table 8 it can be seen that without vegetable or other high value crops, irrigation would be financially viable to the farmer essentially only if pursued through selfhelp schemes and small electric pumps. If vegetables were included in the cropping pattern only the first 4 options could be pursued on a cost recovery basis. 12. The economic analysis suggests that, broadly, technologies up to shallow tubewells (Option 6) could be exploited on the basis of irrigation on existing widespread cropping patterns. Under special circumstances where high value crops such as vegetables can be marketed, more costly technologies such as the use of petrol/kerosene pumps and reservoir schemes may be economically justifiable (up to Option 9). However, the exploitation of such technologies would need to be based on individual appraisals and these technologies could not be recommended for widespread strategic adoption. 13. Table 8 also indicates that the proposed 20,000 ha scheme ranked twelfth in the list of options and that its cost was considerable above the "economic limit with special crops". In addition, the implementation and operation of that scheme was regarded as one of the most difficult of all options. The proposed project was therefore given low priority for financing on economic and managerial grounds. Instead, a revised and composite project proposal was prepared consisting of elements of the first 9 options only.
LAND DEVELOPMENT FOR ORCHARDS ON STEEP SLOPES (November 1989).
Establishing orchards in hilly areas often involves the construction of terraces in order to facilitate agricultural practices and reduce soil erosion. Since a considerable amount of earth will have to be moved, either a large number of labourers, with or without animal power, or mechanized equipment such as bulldozers would have to be used.
The construction of terraces involves the following: -. -. -. -. -. -. -. -. -. a topographical survey of the area to be terraced; a soil survey; a survey of the existing surface drainage; detailed designs and working drawings of the complete works; earthmoving; construction of risers; surfacing of risers; construction of pick-up ditches; construction of drainage outlets and channels.
The amount of earth to be moved depends upon slopes. On average, 3,000 to 3 4,000 m /ha should be expected for slopes varying 15 to 18o. Also width of terraces is dependent upon slopes. As generally one row of trees is placed on each terrace about 3-4 m width are required. Vertical spacing of terraces is then a function of slope. Most terraces are constructed with both longitudinal and cross slopes to facilitate sub-surface and surface drainage of rain water.
Bench terraces usually expose the infertile subsoil which could result in lower production unless some improvement measures are taken. Practices are to excavate a 1 m wide and 1 m deep ditch along the centre line of the terrace. The bottom of the ditch is sloping in line with the longitudinal slope of the terrace and its lower end is connected to a drain system. If necessary, rocks are being blasted. Stones and rocks excavated from the terraces and from ditch construction are being used to reinforce the risers of the terraces where necessary.
The excavated ditches are being filled with a 10 cm layer of organic material which may be of various origins such as grass, leaves, etc. and serves largely for drainage purposes. Where soils are heavy, this layer should be replaced by gravel or rocks on the uphill side of the ditch to ensure a more efficient drainage system. To avoid plugging by soil, some organic material should be placed on top of the gravel. Gravel and stones are normally excavated during ditch construction and thus readily available on site. A 15 cm layer of soil is placed on top of the organic material or gravel/rock layer followed by about 200 kg/ha of fertilizer. This, again, is covered repeatedly by a soil layer and a fertilizer application until the ditch is filled. Total amount of fertilizer applied may reach about 2,000 kg/ha. The type of fertilizer depends upon the inherent solid fertility.
After the ditch is filled to the top, the new soil is tilled and planted with a leguminous crop. At maturity it is ploughed under and left to decompose for about 6 months. Thereafter the planting ground is considered ready for transplanting of seedlings.
The total operation requires about 2,500 to 3,000 labour-days of work at a total cost of about US$2,500/ha (China) of which excavation and riser construction works account for 50%, fertilizer for 33% and the other soil improvement measures including protection of the risers for 17%.
The presented practice of land development for orchards has proven successful on a large scale in China.

OPTIMIZING IRRIGATION INVESTMENTS THROUGH SIMULATION STUDIES (November 1989) (A Case Study) Introduction.
This paper intends to introduce the use of simulation techniques to optimize irrigation investments by way of an example for a large-scale irrigation scheme in India. The inter-relationships between the various future users and the opportunities to invest funds for improved irrigation performances were complex and could not be understood without a comprehensive system simulation study. The Need for Investment.
The project had a command area of about 94,000 ha of which only 65,000 ha received water on average during a year. In addition a further 5,000 ha were irrigated unauthorized outside the official command area boundary. The project irrigated thus 70,000 ha on average but irrigation facilities existed for about 99,000 ha. The shortfall of 29,000 ha was in the tail-end of the authorized system. It was the objective of the proposed project to rectify this discrepancy. How this could be achieved, however, was unclear at the beginning of the investigation. The Physical Settings.
Two reservoirs in tandem supplied water to the project area. The upper one (Reservoir 1) had a live storage of 840 Mm3 and the lower one (Reservoir II) of 480 Mm3. Reservoir I was constructed essentially to provide water to a large city and to generate electricity. However, the reservoir had been completed recently and no experiences as to its effect on the lower lying irrigation scheme was available. Some irrigation also took place between the two reservoirs. Provision of water supply t the city had priority over irrigation and irrigation had priority over power production. However, power would be produced also during the irrigation off-season, provided that Reservoir II would not spill.
Water supply from Reservoir I was as follows:.
Month June July August September October November December January February March April May Total.
Mm3 20 30 32 33 35 29 17 24 23 27 17 24 311.
Over the study period of 20 years siltation of Reservoir I would be 7 Mm3/year, most of which would be settled in the live storage area. This would affect the area/capacity curve in future as shown below:.
Storage Level Storage Capacity Reservoir I Area Storage Capacity Reservoir I Area Mm3 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 24 32 45 63 86 116 155 206 268 342 425 517 621 750 842 ha 680 1,026 1,480 2,018 2,664 3,428 4,482 5,677 6,763 7,944 8,787 9,672 11,438 14,361 16,260 Mm3 5 13 17 25 29 59 98 130 192 247 330 403 507 617 709 ha 34 437 834 1,315 1,904 2,611 3,627 4,765 5,813 6,956 7,780 8,665 10,489 13,506 16,260.
Since the silt load of the river would be retained in Reservoir I, no significant storage capacity would be lost in Reservoir II located just 90 km downstream.
The main canal capacity was designed for 97 m3/s at full supply level. However, due to siltation and deterioration of the canal banks and structures, the main canal capacity had declined to about 76 m3/s. The proposals made by the project authorities included upgrading of the main canal to allow at least a delivery of 83 m3/s. The simulation study has taken this value into account (see below).

The Simulation Study Objective.
The objective of the simulation study was to evaluate water availability and optimize its use for the main irrigation area under the new set of conditions, which would be radically different from those in the past due to the construction of the upper dam. As the future water availability for the irrigation area would allow a number of agricultural options such as the ratio of area coverage under irrigation during the wet and dry seasons, changing of cropping patterns and cropping calendars - the study was to determine the most productive solution within the existing socio-economic framework. Essential Features.
The study was programmed in Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet which was familiar with the local project preparation cell. The first 2 years of the 20 year study (beginning with June 1967) have been reproduced in Table 1 to allow the reader to follow the inter-relationships between the various factors at play and copy the methodology applied for similar situations in other projects. The mathematical inter-relationships (formulae) are given in Table.
10. The study commences by determining the future inflow into Reservoir I from historic data collected at Reservoir II (Columns 2 to 5). Increased upstream use over the next 20 years from neighbouring States have been considered (Column 4). The planned and actual possible releases from Reservoir I (water supply and irrigation upstream and downstream of Reservoir II) determine, together with inflow and reservoir evaporation, the monthly reservoir balance of Reservoir I (Column 13). Spills from Reservoir I are shown for information in Column 14. It should be noted that releases for the irrigation system from Reservoir I (Column 9) were only made if they could not be met from Reservoir II balance or its own inflow. This allowed the maximization of power production from Reservoir I through maximizing the hydraulic head on the turbines. 11. Inflow to Reservoir II (Column 19) was determined from historic data minus that retained at Reservoir I plus a certain percentage of irrigation return flows (15% of the releases shown in Column 8). The calculation of the crop water requirement and deduction of the effective rainfall led to the net irrigation requirement in Column 33 for the cropping pattern and calendar as shown in paras 6 and.
The irrigated areas of the various crops are shown in Columns 34 to 40. For these crops only the area of the canal irrigated paddy was considered as an option for change, since the paddy under tanks is geographically fixed and sugarcane expansion is not considered in future. 12. From the net irrigation requirement and the area cropped, the irrigation requirement was determined in Columns 42 to 47. Up to 24 Mm3/month of this requirement was expected to be met by groundwater if a deficit occurred either due to canal capacity constraints or water deficits at the source. The use of groundwater is estimated in Column 49. However, use of groundwater was not considered to be available for project operation,.
and releases of irrigation water (Column 50) did not consider groundwater resources. Considerations of groundwater use had only been made to allow indications of likely crop deficits incase the study would be used to estimate future productivity of different options (Column 56). The inflow to Reservoir II minus evaporation from the reservoir and the releases, led to a new monthly Reservoir II balance (Column 54). 13. In January the water availability for a possible dry season irrigation (in addition to sugar cane) (Column 59) was determined from the estimated reservoir balances of both reservoirs in May (Columns 13 and 54, e.g. 778 Mm3) after considering evaporation losses between January and May, expected future urban water supply releases from Reservoir II (Column 57) and two irrigation supplies to tanks (Column 58) of 56 Mm3/7 . The amount of water needed to irrigate a dry season crop over a certain area (Column 60, e.g. 429 Mm3) was deducted from the reservoir balance of both reservoirs and the remaining water stored in Reservoir II and shown at the end of May in each year in Column 54 (row between the water years, e.g. 350 Mm3). The crop water requirement for a dry season crop was taken at 600 mm at the crop and applied with a 42% delivery efficiency. Options Investigated 14. Computer runs clearly indicated that the main effect of Reservoir I on the irrigation system was a reduced water supply during the wet season and an increased water availability during the dry season. It was therefore concluded that one scenario would be to reduce the authorized wet season area (say by 30,000 ha) and to formally establish a dry season area in the remaining area - which would also largely cover the present gap area. Another scenario would be to maximize the wet season area (the status quo) and provide irrigation for the dry season over an area that would vary according to water availability. 15. The wet/dry season scenario was investigated for 4 different options over a period of 20 years as follows:.
Main Canal m3/s.
This procedure of calculations is not truly following simulation techniques but was adopted to reduce programming time. It provided fairly accurate results.
The wet season maximization scenario was operated for the existing irrigation area of about 90,000 ha (authorized plus unauthorized area) with 2 options of main canal capacities (76 and 90 m3/s). Results 16. Results of the 4 wet/dry season scenario options are shown in Table 3 and indicate that reducing the area to be irrigated during the wet season by 30,000 ha to 69,159 ha would allow the present main canal capacity of 76 m3/s to fully provide the available water both during the wet and dry season. In this scenario on average about 78,000 ha per year or 79% would be irrigated of which about 60,000 ha would be irrigated during the wet season and about 18,000 ha during the dry season. 17. Reducing the area to be irrigated during the wet season by only 20,000 ha would result in a decreased dry season area on average by about 5,000 ha to 13,000 ha while the average wet season area would increase by almost the same amount to about 65,000 ha. Thus, total annual area would be on average also 78,000 ha irrigated. From the aspect of total area covered per year no significant difference would exist therefore between the selection of 20,000 ha or 30,000 ha irrigated during the dry season. 18. The results of maximizing the wet season area are shown in Table 4 for two options of 76 m3/s and 90 m3/s main canal capacity. On average over 20 years total area irrigated for the 76 m3/s option would be 87,300 ha and for the 90 m3/s, 88,550 ha. Thus, the larger canal capacity would allow irrigation of an additional 1,250 ha yearly. This difference may be regarded as insignificant and would probably not justify the needed investments for upgrading of the main canal. However, compared with the wet/dry season scenario and additional 10,000 ha and above could be irrigated. The difference can be attributed to reduced spill and less evaporation from the reservoirs when maximizing the wet season area. Strategies and the Proposed Operational Plan Strategies 19. The reduction of the wet season irrigation area by some reasonable amount equal to about the present average gap area (29,000 ha) would improve reliability of supply to the reduced wet season area since emergency operations throughout the command area to provide water to the tail-end areas would significantly reduce. In addition water presently used with low efficiency at the tail-end during the wet season (which is entirely under paddy) could be stored in future for a much higher dry season productivity. Furthermore, should a carry-over policy be adopted (water brought forward from one wet season to the next for an early wet season start), less water would need to be stored under this alternative. In summary the advantage of this strategy is clearly a more manageable irrigation operation. 20. The main disadvantage of this strategy is a less efficient use of overall water.
