<title>ADCP/REP/89/43 - Aquaculture Systems and Practices: A Selected Review</title>
<section>1</section>
FOREWORD
At the Expert Consultation on Planning for Aquaculture Development, held in Policoro, Italy, in 1988 (see ADCP/REP/89/33), the participants put forward an integrated set of opportunities for technical assistance to developing countries. The opportunities were predominantly a group of identified needs or ideas, which collectively would assist in guiding investment decisions, primarily at the national level in both the public and private sectors.
One of the production needs identified by the ADCP Consultation was the need for new long-term approaches to increase production of low-cost fish through aquaculture and fisheries technologies. This need is greatest in those countries and sub-regions where population growth is rapidly accelerating the gap between market demand for fish and all potential sources of supply, including traditional aquaculture. Special priority should be given to the promotion of appropriate production systems, which are feasible from a socio-economic and environmental point of view, to enhance production in bodies of water which are not presently considered utilizable. Of particular importance is the promotion and management of culture-based fisheries (particularly in Africa and Latin America); of coastal lagoons (in Africa, Latin America, and the Mediterranean); and in open-water systems (potentially all regions).
At the Consultation, it was proposed that appropriate actions be taken starting at the interregional level "to prepare a catalogue listing available systems and practices of production", to assist governments of developing countries in planning and developing appropriate aquaculture methodologies.
To this end, "Aquaculture Systems and Practices: A Selected Review", commissioned by ADCP, has been prepared by Ms. Elvira Baluyut. It describes available practices in different environments (marine, brackishwater, and freshwater) using the three main culture systems (extensive, semi-intensive, and intensive). In addition, the Selected Review presents various considerations which have to be taken into account in the selection of the most appropriate culture system/approach. It also describes approaches to culture-based fisheries which are seen as potentially useful tools for resource enhancement, especially in those countries where extensive open-water areas are available to use for fisheries development.
The Consultation also pointed out that there is a need to stimulate ideas on innovative and appropriate approaches whereby aquaculture technology can be applied toward the management of large water bodies for increased low-cost fish production. Hence one of the ideas behind the preparation of this Selected Review was the hope that it would lead to an expert consultation to identify and test approaches for aquaculture production of low-cost fish. The approach then should be regional reviews of existing projects, technologies, and resources of the individual regions, followed by regional expert consultations to identify specific research opportunities and to outline model projects (for each region) which are systems-oriented in design and application.

1. INTRODUCTION
Aquaculture continues to increase in volume and value of output in many countries of the world, filling the gap between the supply and demand for fish and fishery products, improving nutrition, creating new or additional employment, and contributing to the household economy, particularly in rural areas.
In 1986, world production from aquaculture reached around 11 million metric tonnes (t) (8.2 million t of fish, crustaceans, and molluscs and 2.8 million t of seaweeds and algae) valued at about US$ 12 thousand million or roughly one-third of that from the total world fisheries catch of. about US$ 30-40 thousand million (Aquaculture Development and Coordination Programme (ADCP), 1989a).
Of the total production from aquaculture some 9 million t, representing around 82% of the global total, were produced in Asia and the balance of 2 million in the other regions of the world (Table 1). The top 16 producers were led by China with an output of about 4.86 million t, followed by Japan with about 1.3 million t, and the Republic of Korea with 993 000 t (Table 2).
It has been estimated that the increasingly substantial contribution of aquaculture to total fish production will continue to rise, with production projected to reach 22 million t by the end of the century, representing about 20-25Z by weight of total world fisheries production and possibly greater than 50% by value as more and more high-value commodities are produced through aquaculture.

2. WHY AQUACULTURE?
The recent great interest In aquaculture, or the breeding and rearing of aquatic plants and animals in enclosures/confinements, was spurred by the oil crisis of the early seventies that made the exploitation of aquatic resources through fish capture highly uneconomical and due to declining fish catches in major traditional fishing grounds in a number of developing countries in the world. The farming of fish was seen as the best option to catching fish to feed the growing masses, provide them with alternative livelihood opportunities for their socio-economic upliftment, as well as generate much-needed foreign exchange to service foreign debt.
In many countries, especially in the developing world, fish and other aquaculture products serve as the main source of cheap protein to combat malnutrition and under-nutrition, fish having essential amino acids that are often lacking in cereal protein substitutes. Value-wise, cultured fish products compete with poultry and livestock in the local market. Nutrition - wise, however, aquaculture species are more efficient in converting food into body tissue than poultry or livestock (Liao, 1988).
In Asia, aquaculture products are essential in improving the largely high-carbohydrate, low-protein diet predominant in the region, where paradoxically enough, a great number of people, especially in the rural areas, engage in labour-intensive work but subsist on low-protein diets (Liao, 1988). A relatively small amount of fish protein in combination with a cereal-based diet would enhance the nutritional quality of the cereal protein, improve the overall quality of the diet, and therefore increase labour efficiency.

In addition to supplying cheap protein for human consumption, aquaculture provides excellent opportunities for employment and income generation, particularly in the more economically depressed rural areas. Aquaculture employs large numbers of people either directly in fish farming activities (as for example, fish pond/fish pen/fish cage operators, caretakers, construction workers, pump tenders, vehicle/machine operators, harvesting aides) or indirectly as employees in related or ancillary industries (as net manufacturers, boat-makers, fry gatherers, bamboo suppliers).
Although the number of people directly involved in aquaculture production is difficult to estimate for lack of statistical information, especially on a global basis, China's 350 000 people employed in its 22 000 village-operated fish farms and the Philippines' approximately 250 000 fish pond employees, give some indications as to the magnitude of the aquaculture industry's labour force (Baluyut, 1989a). Moreover, it has been shown that aquaculture labour is more productive than comparable agricultural activities and that income and profits generated from aquaculture are generally higher than those derived from other agricultural activities (Trono, 1988).
Aquaculture has also been the best means of alternative livelihood for fishing communities whose traditional source of income has been substantially adversely affected by the over-exploitation of coastal municipal fishing grounds. The introduction of small-scale aquaculture in many such areas has been shown to create employment and improve the socio-economic status of subsistence fishermen. Doty (1977, as cited in Trono, 1988), noted that incomes of artisanal fishermen in the South China Sea region have increased several times over with their participation in seaweed farming. Likewise, the introduction of seaweed culture has transformed Sitangkai, a small, sleepy fishing village in remote Tawi-Tawi, Sulu, the Philippines' southernmost province, into a very progressive town (Trono, 1988).
In this sense, aquaculture therefore not only provides employment/livelihood opportunities; it also contributes to the development of rural areas. It also helps maximize the use of idle or marginal lands in a number of developing countries where land is still the basis of wealth and social status and thus, general well-being. Aquaculture has, for example, helped restore economic activity in Negros Province, the Philippines to usual high levels after the collapse of the sugar industry caused severe economic dislocation, especially among the rural farm workers. (At present, Negros Province has the most intensively managed shrimp ponds in the country, most of which have been constructed from what used to be sugarcane fields.)
Aquaculture is also an important alternative for those countries whose traditional fishing grounds have been severely reduced by the imposition of the 200-mile Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), primarily by the introduction of fish farming in areas well within the EEZ (Liao, 1988).
Aquaculture has likewise proven to be an excellent source of foreign exchange for aquaculturally-producing countries with the export of high-value species like penaeid shrimps, oysters, and seaweeds. For example, the Republic of Korea has a monopoly of supplying salted sea mustard (Undaria) or "wakame" to Japan, of which it exported 23 000 t valued at US$ 30 million in 1982. It is also an exporter of oysters, mainly canned, to the USA, Canada, Australia, and the Netherlands, bringing in resources of US$ 27.5 million in 1982 (Baluyut, 1989a).
In the ASEAN countries, the Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand, and Malaysia have all registered increasing export earnings from aquaculture. For example, the Philippines has become a leading exporter of jumbo tiger shrimp, Penaeus monodon, mainly to Japan, with 24 292 t valued at US$ 251 226 428 in 1987. It is also a top exporter of dried and processed seaweeds, earning an estimated US$ 26 848 238 from 26 651 t shipped out in 1987 (Baluyut, 1989a).
Aquaculture development also spurs the establishment and growth of related industries in support of production, as feed-milling, fish processing, ice-making and cold storage, net manufacture, and even construction. In major aquaculture producing countries, the manufacture of fish/shrimp feeds and support equipment, supplies, and materials has expanded side by side with the expansion of aquaculture. Taiwan, Province of China (PC) is a case in point. The phenomenal growth of shrimp culture also saw the proliferation and expansion of shrimp feed-milling enterprises and of manufacturers of aquaculture equipment like paddlewheels, aerators, and various pumps.
In the Philippines, the introduction and subsequent expansion of fish pen culture in Laguna de Bay spurred the growth of ancillary industries like net manufacture, bamboo-cutting, and milkfish fry collection.

3. GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS IN THE CHOICE OF CULTURE SYSTEM/APPROACH
3.1 Development Goals and Target Beneficiaries
3.2 Culture Species
3.3 Technology Availability
3.4 Availability of Inputs and Support Facilities
3.5 Investment Requirements
3.6 Environmental Considerations
The selection of the aquaculture system or approach to adopt in a particular development, is determined by several factors including the following:
(i) Development goals/objectives and target beneficiaries.
(ii) Acceptability/marketability of culture species.
(iii) Availability and level of technology.
(iv) Availability of production inputs and support facilities and services.
(v) Investment requirements, and
(vi) Environmental considerations.
3.1 Development Goals and Target Beneficiaries
A primary consideration in the choice of appropriate culture system/approach would be the underlying goals/objectives of the proposed development and the beneficiaries it envisions to assist.
Development objectives, as discussed in the preceding section, can include any or all or a combination of the following:
(i) Increased supply/production of fish for local/domestic consumption.
(ii) Employment/livelihood generation and improved income levels.
(iii) Greater foreign exchange revenues, and
(iv) Socio-economic development and the expansion of ancillary industries.
Aquaculture development, when pursued by the private sector on a commercial scale, is usually undertaken primarily for financial profit. In contrast, government-led and implemented aquaculture projects may be motivated principally by socio-economic goals like the provision of alternative employment and livelihood opportunities for municipal/artisanal fishermen, or the generation of greater foreign exchange earnings for the country.
Depending on the specific project goals and the target beneficiaries, the approach to aquaculture development may be small-scale, low-input, and low-technology or large-scale, high-investment, and high-technology, as the case may be. If the project is envisioned to help coastal subsistence fishermen improve their socio-economic condition, the approach to be taken must necessarily involve small-scale farming which requires low capital outlay, low technology, and low risk, as in seaweed farming, mollusc culture, or tilapia cage culture. On the other hand, commercial aquaculture operations can be as large-scale, high-input, and high-risk as the owners can afford, as in highly intensive shrimp fish ponds or large-scale fish pen operations.
3.2 Culture Species
The choice of culture species is, in more ways than one, closely linked with the objectives of the development and therefore the strategy/approach to be used to achieve set goals. Not all fish species are suitable for aquaculture. By the same token, some cultivable species are more appropriate for large-scale, commercial aquaculture rather than for small-scale operations, as exemplified by the high-value shrimps, the production of which can hardly be undertaken profitably on a small scale. Also, some species are best cultured using specific types of enclosures; for example, penaeid shrimps are best cultured in fish ponds rather than in fish pens, and certain species are more acceptable in certain countries than in others (Table 3).
The choice of species for culture depends on a number of factors including the availability of suitable sites for culture, the biological characteristics of the indigenous or introduced/exotic species, their suitability for culture, and their acceptability in the local or international markets, and the availability of technology and other requirements for their culture.

Huet and Timmermans (1972) list the following criteria for evaluating the suitability of a species for culture:
(i) It must withstand the climate of the region in which it will be raised. Thus, the rearing of coldwater fish like salmonids and trout is limited to temperate regions or mountain areas of tropical countries because they can not tolerate warm water with its low oxygen content.
(ii) Its rate of growth must be sufficiently high. Small species, even if they reproduce well in ponds and accept formulated diets, are not the most suitable for rearing. Also, the best culture species are those which are low in the food chain, e.g., plankton feeders, herbivores, and detritivores. Their culture is also least expensive, even on an intensive scale, because they do not need to be given diets which have a high content of animal protein.
(iii) It must be able to reproduce successfully under culture conditions. Species for culture should be able to reproduce in captivity/confinement without needing special conditions that have to be fulfilled, and which give high returns on eggs and fry. Although it is possible to rear species whose reproduction in confinement is not possible at all (e.g., some carps) or whose reproduction under hatchery conditions has not yet been possible on a commercial scale (e.g., milkfish in the Philippines), the sustainability of the grow-out operations is hampered by the seasonal unavailability of wild fry for stocking in fish pens and/or fish ponds.
(iv) It must accept and thrive on abundant and cheap artificial food. Culture species which feed on cheap artificial feeds and give low feed conversion ratios (FCRs), also tend to give very good production rates, thus bringing in better financial returns.
(v) It must be acceptable to the consumer. Even if all the foregoing criteria are met by a candidate species, it is not worth culturing if there is no market for it. It is possible, though, to promote acceptability of or encourage consumption of a particular species to ensure that it will eventually sell in the market. (This was the situation with tilapia in the Philippines prior to the introduction of the bigger-sized, lighter coloured S. niloticus in the early 1970s.)
(vi) It should support a high population density in ponds. Social and gregarious species which can grow well to marketable size even under high density conditions in ponds or tanks (e.g., tilapia) are preferable to those which can be grown together in dense numbers only up to a certain age beyond which they eat each other (e.g., pike).
(vii) It must be disease-resistant. Reared fish must be resistant to disease and accept handling and transport without much difficulty. Tilapia is an ideal species for culture because of its high resistance to disease even in highly intensive culture systems.
A wide variety of fish and aquatic resources is cultured in freshwater, brackishwater, and marine environments world-wide using different methods (Table 4). Rabanal (1988a) estimates that there are close to 50 species of freshwater, brackishwater, and marine finfish species; about 13 crustacean species, 13 molluscan species, 5 seaweed species, and 5 economic aquatic vertebrates (frogs and other amphibians and turtles and other reptiles) cultivated in Southeast Asia.
Liao (1988) lists some 25 major finfish species, 18 molluscan species, 2 reptile species, 2 amphibian species, and 4 seaweed species as the principal species cultured in Asia (Table 4). To the list could be added the crustaceans consisting of the brackishwater/marine penaeid shrimps (mainly Penaeus monodon, P. semisulcatus, P. japonicus, P. orientalis, P. merguiensis, and Metapenaeus ensis) and the freshwater prawn of the genus Macrobrachium; the seaweeds Eucheuma, Laminaria, and Porphyra; and marine finfishes like sea bass and groupers (Baluyut, 1989a).

In Africa, the predominant species are the tilapias, carps, mullets, sea bass, and catfishes; in addition, some salmonids, miscellaneous freshwater fish, molluscs, and crustaceans are also cultured. Latin America grows miscellaneous exotic fish and marine shrimps, molluscs, and salmonids. Successful experiments on the artificial reproduction and pond culture of indigenous finfishes of the genus Colossoma and Piaractus (locally known as "tambaqui" and "pirapitinga" in Brazil, "cachama" and "morocoto" in Venezuela, "gamitama" and "parco" in Peru, and "cachama negra" and "cachama blanco" in Colombia) also give promise of increased yields (Saint-Paul, 1989). The Caribbean rears tilapia, carp, marine and freshwater crustaceans, oysters, and seaweeds; in the Mediterranean region, salmonids are the prime fish and carps are secondary fish. In the Pacific, tilapia, milkfish, catfish, salmonids, marine and freshwater crustaceans, molluscs (including giant clams and pearl oysters), and
seaweeds are cultured but mostly on a pilot/experimental scale (ADCP, 1989a).
3.3 Technology Availability
As aquaculture involves the application of certain methods and techniques in the breeding and rearing of fish and other aquatic species, the selection of a particular culture system will necessarily depend on whether or not the technology for such is available in the country or project area and if so, its level of complexity and/or transferability to the fish farmer beneficiaries.
In general, simple, low-cost, low-technology systems (as for tilapia culture) are easier to transfer to the end users and have greater chances of success as compared to more sophisticated/complicated and relatively high-technology systems like those involved in penaeid hatchery and farming, especially using intensive culture techniques.
Thus, if aquaculture is being considered as an alternative livelihood for displaced coastal fishing families, the preferred system is one that will require the use of simple techniques and low-cost production facilities whose construction and operation may involve entire families or communities, e.g., seaweed and mollusc farming. On the other hand, more complex technologies which require higher capital and other inputs and which promise better profits, are usually adopted by medium- to large-scale entrepreneurs who have the capability to engage the services of technical specialists in running their operations.
3.4 Availability of Inputs and Support Facilities
Corollary to the level of technology is the ready availability of the production inputs, mainly seed and feeds, and ancillary facilities and services like hatcheries, feed mills, processing plants, ice plants, and cold storages. At the grassroots level, it is essential that not only are the production inputs available, the fish farmers should be adequately provided with technical assistance including training and extension support. For large-scale, intensive, commercial operations, especially those geared for the export market, the constant availability of seed and feeds is critical as well as the existence of adequate post-harvest handling and processing facilities to ensure high quality products.
3.5 Investment Requirements
The magnitude of financial investment required to set up, operate, and maintain an aquaculture operation depends on the level of technology involved and the type of culture system adopted. In general, the investment requirement Increases as a function of technology level and degree of complexity of the culture system, with extensive systems requiring the least capital investment and intensive systems needing the most.
Thus, as mentioned earlier, small-scale aquaculture development projects which involve simple production facilities (like rafts and stakes for mollusc culture and bamboos and ropes for seaweed farming) require minimal financial inputs. In contrast, highly intensive, highly complicated production systems, as those used for intensive shrimp grow-out operations, require large outlays not only for initial development but also for operation and maintenance.
The major cost items in aquaculture production, as in any other type of agriculture, include initial development and pre-operating costs including cost of land/site acquisition, production inputs (seed, feed, fertilizers, pesticides), and operating and maintenance costs (including cost of labour, power, supplies and materials), and miscellaneous expenses including harvesting and marketing costs.
Where investment costs are high and land and labour are limited and costly, as in Japan and Taiwan (PC), the trend will be intensification to achieve maximum yields per unit area. Where land, labour and fish are inexpensive and feed is unavailable or costly, as in the Philippines and Indonesia, the trend is for extensive culture utilizing larger pond area and natural food.
3.6 Environmental Considerations
Much concern has been raised over the potential adverse impacts of aquaculture on the environment, especially as a result of intensive culture. Taiwan (PC) and the serious shrimp disease and water quality problems it presently faces as a result of the tremendous expansion of its intensive shrimp industry, is the best example one can think of at the moment.
The widespread destruction of mangrove forests to give way to fish ponds, has also disturbed the ecological equilibrium in a number of coastal zones, reducing aquatic productivity and eliminating breeding and nursing grounds of important species of fish and other aquatic life, among others.
In Australia, the possibility of eutrophication of natural waters from high nutrient loads discharged from fish ponds is a subject of concern (Jamandre, 1988). In Negros Province in the Philippines, a continuing debate between two main industries - aquaculture and sugar - over industry standards, remains unresolved as wastes discharged by sugar refineries into the river used by aquaculture farms as a water source, have reportedly caused increased temperature and acidity levels that have disastrous effects on the shrimp farms (Cayco, 1988).
Aquaculture can produce a number of negative impacts on the environment (Table 5). It is therefore important to take environmental considerations into account in selecting the culture system to adopt, either by reducing the extent to which aquaculture practices interfere with the ecology of the aquatic milieu or by making the milieu itself more amenable to the aquaculture pursuit (UNDP/NORAD/FAO, 1987).
Concern that coastal aquaculture can have adverse impacts on the coastal environment has prompted a number of authors to suggest practical guidelines for siting and operating aquaculture installations in mangrove systems. Kapetsky (1982) summarizes these as follows:
(i) Establishment of types of aquaculture which do not involve destruction of mangroves and associated flora and fauna, e.g., fish cages and fish pens in open water areas.
(ii) Integrated aquaculture and forestry, e.g., planting of mangroves along fish pond dikes and other nearby suitable areas.
(iii) Preservation of a functional ecosystem by means of:
- establishment of aquaculture in areas already reclaimed from mangroves rather than on productive mangrove stands, where possible;
- utilization of the least productive parts of the mangrove forest or those with the lowest value trees;
- locating aquaculture sites toward the landward side of the mangroves to preserve the productivity of the most productive portions for capture fishery resources;
- ensuring that the Area occupied by ponds and other elements of the farm should be small in relation to the overall area of the mangrove system in which they are installed.
(iv) Paying ample attention to site selection, culture installation design, and the management of culture operations.

4.1 Historical Perspective
Aquaculture has a tradition of about 4 000 years. It began in China, possibly due to the desires of an emperor to have a constant supply of fish. It is speculated that the techniques for keeping fish in ponds originated in China with fishermen who kept their surplus catch alive temporarily in baskets submerged in rivers or small bodies of water created by damming one side of a river bed. Another possibility is that aquaculture developed from ancient practices for trapping fish, with the operations steadily improving from trapping-holding to trapping-holding-growing, and finally into complete husbandry practices (Ling, 1977).
