As shown empirically for many transition economies, even small changes in assumptions on economies of size and adult equivalence scales are likely to produce significant changes in the analysis of poverty and its distribution across households and individuals. Since such exercises are then used to orient and prioritize policy actions (e.g. the targeting of scarce social assistance resources) it is important to refine our understanding of the extent to which poverty measures and the resulting profiles are sensitive to specific assumptions. In this paper we investigate how combining objective and subjective measures of welfare can provide insights that are helpful in addressing these questions, particularly with respect to the presence of economies of scale in consumption.

Introduction Following the collapse of the communist regime, in the past decade Albania has pursued an aggressive reform agenda towards a fully-functioning market economy. After a period of erratic growth in the early 1990s, linked to a series of political and economic crises, since 1997 annual GDP growth rates have consistently been among the highest in Europe varying from 4.7 to 8 percent. Sustained growth is predicted to continue in the next 3-4 years. However, despite impressive achievements in some areas, living standards remain among the lowest in Europe ­ with GDP per capita at less than $1,300 ­ and dismal conditions of basic services and public infrastructure. Analysis based on a recent nationally representative Living Standards Measurement Study survey (LSMS) indicates widespread income poverty across Albanian households, with one in four Albanians living below the poverty line. This poverty incidence estimate is based on a consumption-based money metric indicator, as is generally the case in traditional welfare analysis. These measures inevitably imply making a number of more or less arbitrary assumptions on economies of size and adult equivalence scales1. As empirically shown for several transition and developing countries, even relatively small changes in the economies of scale assumptions underlying conventional quantitative measures can produce significant changes in the analysis of poverty and its distribution across households and individuals2. Sensitivity analysis is generally performed to test the robustness of the results, but it is inevitable that such assumptions do affect the results of any exercise aimed at sketching the demographic and spatial profiles of poverty in a country. Particularly in transition economies, some of these assumptions have been shown to raise concerns on some of the results of poverty analysis. For example, a consistent finding in poverty profiles in transition economies, including Albania, is the high incidence of poverty among large households with many children vis a vis the moderate poverty rates exhibited by households comprised by elderly individuals (Lanjouw et al, 2004; World Bank and INSTAT, 2003). In transition economies, where the magnitude of recent relative price changes is such as to generate rapid changes in the extent of economies of scale in consumption, it becomes increasingly important to gain a better understanding on the consequences of discounting the presence of scale effects in consumption. In Poland, for instance, the relative price of housing (an expenditure component typically associated with economies of scale) compared to food increased 455 percent between 1989 and 1993 which, at given expenditure patterns, can translate into a sizeable increase in the magnitude of economies of scale in consumption, with a potential relative adverse effect on smaller households. Failing to capture the effect of these changes can significantly affect the poverty ranking of different population groups, not only large vs. small households, but also the elderly vis-à-vis the young, or female headed households (Lanjouw et al., 2004). The policy implications of neglecting this reality can be.

especially pernicious, for instance in terms of prioritization and targeting of public expenditure and social policies. In addition to the stated potential problem related with the presence of scale economies not adequately captured by conventional poverty analysis, relying exclusively on objective income or expenditure measures of welfare presumes that respondents think about their welfare in monetary terms alone, while their assessment may be more complex. A gap between objective and subjective measurements of welfare is frequently observed and there is a growing body of literature attempting to explain the observed differences. Factors affecting people's own perception of welfare may include their employment and health status, demographic factors such as marital status and age, relative wealth status (i.e. relative to a reference group, e.g. people living in the same area), and not least stable inherent personality traits. The main goal of this paper is to investigate how combining objective and subjective measures can provide useful insights into welfare analysis and the profiling of poverty in a country. Towards this end, we first explore how closely do the profiles of poverty obtained through an objective and a subjective measure match. We then focus on explaining the differences observed by looking, among other things, at the role played by economies of scale in consumption and at how people's own perception of welfare can contribute to inform the debate on scale economies in consumption expenditures. The Albania 2002 LSMS offers an excellent opportunity to build on the existing literature. This dataset, in fact, allows the construction of good nationally representative measures of objective welfare based on consumption expenditures, while also including multiple instruments for the assessment of subjective welfare. The analysis in this paper will also benefit from other work that has integrated the LSMS dataset with population census data and additional official data sources. We are therefore able to use for the first time an uncommonly rich dataset, in terms of both geographic and thematic coverage. In more detail, the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we present a brief review of the recent literature on subjective welfare. Section 3 introduces recent objective and subjective measurements of poverty in Albania, and section 4 compares the poverty profiles associated with each measure. Section 5 analyses the determinants of subjective welfare in a multivariate setting and explores the viability of using respondent perception to complement traditional profiling of poverty. The paper closes with some concluding remarks.
Subjective measures of welfare: A brief literature review In the last couple of decades the literature on the measurement and analysis of poverty has been growing rapidly across the spectrum of the social sciences. This growth has been linked to the parallel increase in the availability of both qualitative and quantitative data on poverty and standards of living. As a result, a related body of literature trying to understand the differences, links, and overlaps between quantitative and qualitative approaches to poverty measurement and analysis has emerged. In this section we will briefly review some recent contributions of the latter strand of literature that are closely related to our analysis. More extensive reviews can be found in Oswald (1997), Ravallion and Lokshin (2000), and Frey and Stutzer (2002).
A variety of approaches have been proposed to quantify poverty and welfare through instruments that rely on respondents' subjective assessments. One of the earliest attempts was proposed by Cantril (1965), who pioneered the idea of a ladder on which respondents were asked to rank themselves in terms of happiness or satisfaction with life. This has been modified to a narrower definition of economic welfare, asking people to put themselves on a poverty scale. Examples are the Philippines Social Weather Station (Mangahas, 1995), the Eurobarometer (Riffault, 1991), and Ravallion and Lokshin (2002). An alternative approach to mixing quantitative and qualitative methodologies for poverty measurement does not abandon the use of consumption or income estimates that are proper of standard `objective' measures, but combines them with subjective assessments. The approach was first introduced by Van Praag (1968), with the Income Evaluation Question (IEQ). The question consists of asking respondents what income they would consider "very bad" to "very good" (with a number of options in between). The answers are then used to construct a utility function on which to assess welfare. A similar method (Kapteyn, 1994) asks respondents what income they consider the minimum necessary "to make ends meet" (Minimum Income Question, MIQ). Objectively measured income normalized by the subjective poverty line can then be used as the welfare indicator. However, concerns have been expressed in the literature on how well this question suits the needs of developing countries, where the concept of income may vary greatly across respondents, and from the definition of income as perceived by economists (Ravallion and Lokshin, 2000; Deaton and Zaidi, 2002). Pradhan and Ravallion (2000) adapt Kapteyn's approach to developing country situations, by asking questions on the perceived adequacy of (food or total) household consumption. They then define the subjective poverty line (SPL) as "the level of total spending above which respondents say (on average) that their expenditures are adequate for their needs." Their application of the methodology to Jamaica and Nepal data shows that the responses to these questions can be in line with objective assessments in aggregate, even though the results are different when one tries to sketch demographic or geographic profiles of poverty. In a recent contribution, Lokshin, Umapathi and Paternostro (2004) estimate and compare welfare levels on the basis of categorical consumption adequacy questions for Madagascar and assess the robustness of the poverty profiles derived from different subjective welfare questions. Despite the overall strong correlation between subjective welfare and household income, the measures appear to differ substantially in some of the dimensions analyzed, particularly in relation to the demographic and spatial profile of poverty, raising some questions about the isolated use of objective measures for poverty comparisons within a country. They consequently advocate for the concurrent use of different approaches for better informed welfare analysis. Irrespective of the subjective measure chosen, the literature consistently suggests that selfreported measures of welfare (whether defined broadly, e.g. "happiness", or narrowly, e.g. "poverty" or "financial situation") regularly deviate from objective measures of welfare such as GDP or poverty defined on the basis of income or expenditure data. As mentioned, one.
source of discrepancy is that people may not equate their welfare or poverty with income or expenditure alone3. A further explanation of the observed differences found in the literature is relative income. According to this explanation (Easterlin, 1974), it is relative rather than absolute income that matters in explaining self-reported levels of welfare. Quantitative measures of poverty are in most cases based on absolute poverty lines, but the way people `feel' about their welfare status depends ­according to this interpretation- on how the income around them is distributed. The negative implications of unemployment and poor health on people's perception of own welfare are well documented in the psychology and socio-economic literature. Being unemployed causes depression and anxiety, and carries a social stigma in many societies. At equal income levels, being unemployed or in ill health reduces the subjective assessment of one's welfare, even when this is defined in purely economic terms (Ravallion and Lokshin, 2000). Beyond experiencing unemployment directly, people may also worry about other people's conditions or, more selfishly, they may be concerned that a situation of high unemployment may adversely affect them in the future. Empirical results from 12 European countries shows that a 1 percent point increase in local unemployment levels has a negative impact on people's satisfaction (Frey and Stutzer, 2002). Demographic characteristics (household size, marital status) have also been investigated and found to be significant (Diener et al., 1999; Lanjouw and Ravallion, 1995). Ravallion and Lokshin (2000) using a longitudinal dataset for Russia found that the proportion of women and children in the household and marital status helped explain self-rated welfare. In their analysis, however, household size turns out to be insignificant, and they ascribe this result to the longitudinal dataset which allows them control for otherwise confounding unobserved personality traits. These traits, as suggested by evidence from the psychology literature, can at the same time influence the way people respond to subjective questions as well as their socioeconomic characteristics (employment, income, household size). This complicates the effort to disentangle the various effects in the econometric analysis.
Measuring welfare in Albania An `objective' profile of poverty in Albania has been recently completed through the first nationally representative survey of living standards to include comprehensive information on household expenditure and income. Our data are mainly from this LSMS survey4, which was conducted in Spring 2002 by the Albania Institute of Statistics (INSTAT) with assistance from the World Bank. The survey used a stratified sample of 3600 households, and included an household questionnaire with detailed expenditure information and a subjective welfare module, as well as a community questionnaire through which price data were also collected.
If one accepts the idea that individuals do not equate poverty or their financial situation with consumption or income alone, an implication is that the two measures are in practice measuring different ­ if related ­ things, and as such a difference between them is to be expected. In the multivariate analysis we present at the end of the paper we also include some variables from a dataset obtained though the consolidation of several official data sources, compiled by INSTAT with assistance from the World Bank.
In 64 percent of the cases the subjective module was administered to the household head, in 30 percent of the cases to the head's spouse, and in the remaining 6 percent of the cases to other adult household members5. The objective welfare measure used in this paper is the household total consumption expenditure, deflated for regional price differences. No adjustment was made to account for economies of scale in consumption, as per capita figures were used. The objective poverty measure is based on the computation of a country-specific, absolute poverty line based on the cost-of-basic-needs methodology (Ravallion and Bidani, 1994). To estimate the full poverty line a food poverty line, i.e. the cost of obtaining a certain minimum amount of calories, was first computed and then adjusted to include essential nonfood items. The food basket is anchored to a reference population in the consumption deciles around the poverty line. The nonfood component was calculated as the average non-food share of those households that spend roughly the same amount for food as indicated by the food poverty line. The full poverty line, estimated making an allowance for basic nonfood items, equals 4,891 Leks per capita per month6. The objective poverty headcount for the country based on this poverty line is 25.4 percent (World Bank and INSTAT, 2003). The welfare analysis based on this money metric revealed a pronounced spatial dimension of poverty in the country. Poverty in Albania is predominantly rural. The remote districts in the North and North-East of the country fare worst in terms of poverty: almost half of the residents of this area are poor. As mentioned earlier and as observed in many transition economies, poor Albanians are more likely to live in larger, younger households. Poverty rates are highest among large households with 7 or more members, with headcount rates above 50 percent. About 40 percent of the poor live in these households. Poverty incidence among younger people is above the national average, and is highest among rural children. Almost half of the poor in Albania are below the age of 21. On the contrary, elders in Tirana exhibit some of the lowest rates, with a headcount of 12 percent. Despite the apparent robustness of the findings to different economies of scales assumptions7, it is evident that the assumption made on economies of scale is not neutral. In particular, the per capita measure is known to regularly yield higher poverty rates for large as opposed to small households, and for children as opposed the elderly (as the former tend to live in larger households)8. However, lacking sound empirical information on the exact magnitude of the scale parameters, their choice remains arbitrary. Following the strand of economic literature on subjective welfare we propose complementing the existing poverty profile of Albania with information on respondents' perception of own welfare in an attempt to validate some of the findings and assess the implications of some of the assumptions, including the scale parameter. Specifically, in this paper we will use the responses to the modified Cantril scale question ­ as contained in the 2002 LSMS ­ asking.
Another potential source of discrepancy between the two measures in our dataset is due to the fact that while objective poverty is based on household-level consumption expenditures expressed in per capita terms, the subjective measure is based on individual respondent's perceptions. 6 The average exchange rate at the time of the survey was 1 USD=145 Leks. 7 Poverty rankings according to demographic characteristics in the quantitative profile alone, appear to be robust to different assumptions regarding equivalence scales and economies of size (the net effect of which is reflected in a measure of economies of scale ), even if for some household typologies the poverty numbers do vary quite substantially. Sensitivity analysis results on the objective poverty numbers are reported in Annex I. 8 See Deaton and Paxson (1997) for a discussion.
respondents to rank their financial status on the basis of a ten step welfare ladder9. Ravallion and Lokshin (2002) have termed this the Economic Welfare Question (EWQ). Based on the answers to the EWQ, and assuming that we can classify as poor those households falling in the first two rungs, subjective poverty stands at 26.2 percent (Table 1). The poverty incidence is strikingly close to the objective measure. However, are the individuals in the two groups the same? How correlated are the two measurements? Overall, there seems to be only a partial correspondence between objective and subjective measures. Although the measures are clearly correlated, the Spearman coefficient reveals a moderate association between per capita consumption expenditure and subjective welfare ranking ( = 0.5). Furthermore, among the "objective" poor, only about half perceive themselves as poor. A similar percentage of individuals who perceive themselves as poor are also poor according to the objective money metric measure. Among the non-poor, 1 individual in 5 perceives himself as poor. Despite the closer definition of the Economic Welfare Question to monetary well-being, it appears that people do not equate the concept of poverty exclusively with income and that other factors may be at play. Table 2 shows a cross-tabulation of (un-weighted) objective and subjective measures of household welfare as they emerge from the data in the LSMS. The subjective measure of economic status is the self-reported ranking. The objective measure is per capita consumption by the household, deflated by the poverty line. The table is constructed so that for each rung the number of households placed on each objective welfare rung equals the number of households that are on the corresponding subjective rung. Rungs 7-10 are collapsed into one rung, as very few people placed themselves on the top rungs. In case of perfect correlation the off-diagonal elements of the table would be zero. Clearly, the correlation is far from perfect. Of 271 respondents who place themselves on the lowest rung only 65 (24 percent) are among the poorest according to the objective measure. If we take rungs 1 and 2 (both for objective and subjective), then 50 percent of those who put themselves on the lowest rank are also on the lowest two objective rungs. Nonetheless, the correlation in this dataset is substantially higher than what is sometimes found in the literature10. What this initial descriptive analysis shows is that while subjective and objective welfare ranking are clearly closely related, there may be factors other than (measured) expenditure that explain how people feel (or report feeling) about their welfare. In the remainder of this paper we explore these factors in an attempt to gain a better understanding of the main sources of these discrepancies, including the presence of unaccounted economies of scale in consumption.
Comparing objective and subjective profiles of poverty in Albania On many dimensions, the profiles of poverty from our objective (per capita) and subjective definitions of poverty are very similar (see Table 3). The differences by age groups and.
Specifically, the question was: "Imagine a 10 step ladder where on the bottom, the first step, stand the poorest people, and on the highest step, the tenth, stand the rich. On which step are you today?". 10 Ravallion and Lokshin (2002) find (using income rather than consumption) a Cramer's V of only 0.099 for Russia. Also in their dataset the overlap within the first two rungs applies to only 39 percent of the respondents.
educational levels are minimal. For age, the only slight difference appears to be in the age group of 60 and older (the difference becoming larger for older subgroups, e.g. 70 or 75 and older ­ not shown). For education, respondents with the highest education feel somewhat poorer than what the objective measure would suggest, but for all the other educational groups (where most of the poor belong) the differences are again negligible. There is virtually no difference in the incidence of subjective as opposed to objective poverty by either gender or location. An association emerges from the data between self-assessed poor health and being poor, with the relationship being significantly stronger for the subjective measure of poverty11. Respondents reporting poor health also perceive themselves as significantly poorer than they are based on the objective measure. Similarly, people reporting to be suffering from chronic illnesses score lower on the subjective poverty measure (i.e. the incidence is higher) than on the objective measure, while no difference can be detected among the individuals not reporting such illnesses (not reported)12. Being unemployed may also affect people's subjective welfare. Unemployed individuals may be discouraged about their current situation and future prospects and may hence feel worse off than individuals who have similar levels of consumption but are employed (or they might be smoothing their consumption but be eroding their savings or assets, which would not be captured by the consumption aggregate but certainly can contribute to a bad financial situation). Surprisingly, no significant differences emerge between objective and subjective welfare measurements based on employment status of the respondent. The most substantial difference between the objective and subjective profile emerges for the relationship between poverty and household size, particularly for the households composed by one person only for which the incidence of subjective poverty is highest while the incidence of objective poverty is lowest13. Interestingly, the rankings of poverty incidence for the groups of households of size 2 and over do not change. The only re-ranking occurs for the group of households of size one (Figure 1). Although the gap between objective and subjective profiles with respect to household size is not completely surprising ­ as hypothesized at the beginning ­ it is the magnitude of these differences ­ particularly among household of size one ­ which warrants further investigation. Obvious candidates for an explanation include: (1) an economies of scale effect that is not captured in the objective measure, which is expressed in per capita terms, and (2) factors influencing the response to the subjective poverty questions that are linked to other household.
11 The relationship between health status and self-reported welfare should be interpreted with caution: a person may report a low level of welfare because she is ill, but she may also be inherently pessimistic and hence report a low status in terms of both financial and health conditions. 12 There is an interesting parallel to be made here with the discussion on whether health expenditures should be included in the consumption aggregate (Deaton and Zaidi, 1998). Excluding health expenditures does not differentiate between the welfare of two persons, both ill, when only one can afford medications. But including health expenditure without correcting for the loss of welfare due to illness is also clearly incorrect. The observed discrepancy between objective and subjective welfare for the chronically ill may be at least partly imputed to the respondent implicitly making the adjustment for the welfare loss due to illness that could not be incorporated in the objective measure. 13 Pradhan and Ravallion (2000; p. 469) find the same is true in Nepal (households of size are poorest according to the subjective definition but the least poor according to the objective). In Jamaica, on the contrary, they find the relationship between poverty and household size to be similar for the two measures (poverty incidence increasing with household size).
characteristics that are correlated to living alone (e.g. age; vulnerability; unobserved personality traits). Clearly a combination of the above explanations cannot be ruled out. Table 4 reports some descriptive statistics on the characteristics of our sample of respondents and their households, by household size. Households of size one are in large part (75 percent) old pensioners living alone: the mean age of the respondents in this group is 63 years as opposed to an average age for the total sample of the respondents of 48 years. Female headed households are also disproportionately represented in the size 1 group: 69 percent against an average 12 percent in the total respondent population. Also, 54 percent of the respondents in this household size group are single female pensioners; 56 percent are female widows; 64 percent suffer from chronic illnesses against a population average of 28 percent. One plausible conjecture these statistics suggest, is that the high incidence of subjective poverty in the size 1 group may be reflecting the vulnerability and exposure to risk of single females, widows, and single persons relying on pensions for their livelihoods ­ something that is clearly not captured in the objective measure. This result is in line with a study by Dreze and Srinivasan (1997) who, by relaxing slightly the assumption of no economies of scale, produce a substantially different profile of previous consumption-based analysis, with widows re-ranked as the most vulnerable group in rural India. Finally, the fact that objective poverty is consistently lower than subjective poverty up to household size four and consistently higher at household size larger than five appear to reinforce the fact that some economies of scale effect may indeed be at work, something that would be consistent with what is found in the literature for other transition economies (Lanjouw et al., 1998; van Praag and Warnaar, 1997; Ravallion and Lokshin, 2002). It is to exploring further this hypothesis that we now turn. 4.1 Economies of scale: can we improve our measures of poverty? As Lanjouw and Ravallion (1995) put it, "the choice of a welfare measure, including equivalence scale, is ultimately based on value judgements about which differences of opinion must be expected". In much of the remainder of this paper our attention will be devoted to assess whether combining subjective and objective measures can inform one's value judgement, so as to somewhat reduce the level of arbitrariness inevitably involved in decisions such as the economies of scale parameter of choice. To examine the issue of economies of scale we analyze how the profile of income poverty compares with the subjective measure as we make different assumptions about economies of scale. There is a broad range of reasons to expect that individuals living in households experiencing the same level of per capita consumption expenditure may in fact be able to command different levels of needs satisfaction. Also, larger households may experience economies of scale in consumption, both because some expenditure items (e.g. housing and utilities) have a `public good' component, and because they may be able to buy in bulk at discount prices14. In examining the issue of economies of scale, we now focus on those aspects of the poverty profile in which we found the largest discrepancies between subjective and objective welfare, measured in per capita terms: primarily household size, but also the interaction of household size with age factors.
Additional issues that are related to household size and composition but that we will not tackle here are the intra-household allocation of resources and the fact that different individuals may have different needs (e.g. a person of working age may have higher transport and clothing needs than a pensioner).
When we look back at the distribution of poverty by household size and re-estimate the consumption-based profile ­ keeping the headcount constant ­ on the basis of different levels of economies of scale we find that for a value of =0.5, the similarity between profiles is striking. Once the presence of economies of scale is introduced, the difference between the two measures becomes virtually non existent for all household size categories. The results are also similar when one looks at the incidence of poverty across young as opposed to old households, defined as those with all members above age 59 (see Table 5). While the objective
