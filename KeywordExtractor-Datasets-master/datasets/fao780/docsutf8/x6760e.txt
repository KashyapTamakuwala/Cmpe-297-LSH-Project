Review and Improvement of Data Related to Wood-products Project GCP/INT/679/EC.
Appendix 1 Appendix 2 Appendix 3 Appendix 4 Appendix 5.
Background (A) The EC-FAO Partnership Programme (1998-2000) Strengthening data collection and analysis is critical for improving forest policy formulation and planning at national and sub-national levels. However, this aspect has not been given much attention in most countries, undermining the adoption of sustainable forest management practices. The EC-FAO Partnership Programme (1998-2000) on "Data Collection and Analysis for Sustainable Forest Management in ACP (African, Caribbean and Pacific) Countries - linking National and International Efforts" aims to strengthen national capabilities related to forestry information and statistics. An important starting point for this is to review and validate existing data and to improve the data collection process and methodologies. This present study focuses specifically on aspects of wood-products, such as production, consumption and trade of roundwood, industrial roundwood, sawlogs, veneer logs, pulpwood, wood-chips, sawnwood, wood-based panels, and paper and paperboard, etc. Apart from improving the quality of basic data, this study is expected to strengthen the technical capacity and expertise of the Directorate of Forestry, Namibia, in forestry data collection and analysis to produce information on the forestry sector. Participation in this effort and networking with other national focal points and experts dealing with wood-products statistics is expected to benefit the government of the Republic of Namibia through sharing of methodologies and information and facilitating learning from each other's experience. (B) Forestry Development in Namibia Namibia's forest resources constitute an important national heritage, which provides both economic th and environmental benefits. Forestry development in Namibia started at the beginning of the 20 century when the role of woody vegetation in environmental protection was recognised by the German colonial government. However, the forest resource suffered a great deal under the South African mandate period when the deliberate policy of uncontrolled cutting was encouraged, especially in the communal areas of the North and North East of the country. Indeed no meaningful development activity was initiated in the sector during South African occupation. Colonial policy of forest exploitation, especially in the communal areas, and commercial areas of Tsumeb and Grootfontein that started in the 1930s continued unabated until Namibia attained independence in 1990. Lack of technical capacity to administer forest concessions worsened the situation of uncontrolled forest exploitation. Meanwhile, poor forestry administration constrained the initiation of any meaningful forestry development activities. In the early 1970s and late 1980s, the country's liberation struggle prevented the implementation of forestry development activities in large areas of Northern Namibia, which needed attention and still carries the bulk of the forest resources. For many years forestry development was managed from a small section under the Ministry of Agriculture. Independent Namibia created, in 1990, a Directorate of Forestry, to highlight the importance of forestry to national development and to carry out programmes that are aimed at.
implementing the national forest policy. Presently, the Directorate of Forestry is still in its early developmental stages. The Directorate produced the first Forestry Strategic plan for Namibia in 1996. In addition, in August 1997 the Directorate started carrying out the Namibia-Finland Forestry Programme to implement the Strategic Plan. The strategic Plan is based on ecological, environmental, cultural, and socioeconomic considerations and it considers production, protection and participation as the three important issues of forestry development in Namibia. New Forest legislation was completed in 1997 and is awaiting approval by parliament. The national forest policy of Namibia has been reviewed and is awaiting approval. The main challenges being faced by the Directorate are manpower development, infrastructure development and improvement of data and information for the planning and management of forest resources. Several forestry staff are in colleges and universities to obtain Forestry Diplomas and BSc Degrees. The infra-structural development is almost complete. Forestry data collection, compilation, analysis and dissemination are in progress and need further support and strengthening to institutionalise the process. A process to develop Criteria and Indicators aimed at monitoring sustainable forest management in Namibia is also on going. A few criteria and indicators have now been selected for actual testing in the field. C) Status of wood products data Availability of statistics on production, consumption and trade of wood products in Namibia is scanty and to a certain extent non-existent. The key relevant authorities such as Ministry of Trade and Industry, Customs and Excise and National Planning Commission (Central Statistics Bureau), although collect wood products data, do not have information on wood products in a form that can be readily and easily disseminated to the public. It seems that so far there is no deliberate plan or efforts to regularly analyse this data and provide the information in a format ready for the user. Therefore, in Namibia there is a great and urgent need to establish a comprehensive database on production, consumption and trade of wood products. Obviously, this is a long-term exercise, which should be continued beyond this review, with the assistance of aid organisations. The Directorate of Forestry has started to keep track of wood products trade data through the recently established Forestry Permit System. However, this system now needs to be expanded to include additional data on wood products such as production, consumption and trade of roundwood, industrial roundwood, sawlogs, veneer logs, pulpwood, wood-chips, sawnwood, wood-based panels, and paper and paperboard, etc. Only in this way will information on wood products trade be at the fingertips of the Directorate and thereby become easily disseminated to the public.
Namibia's woody resources play a significant role in the country's economy. The majority of the rural populations derive their livelihood from the forest resources. On the other hand, a limited forestry industry also obtains its raw material from these resources. Below is a brief description of the quantitative state of Namibia's forests and the various wood products derived from them.
Forest resources The main vegetation types available as a source for wood products and of economic interest to forestry development in Namibia are Savannahs and Woodlands. Beginning in 1996 up to date the Directorate of Forestry is carrying out forest inventories in these areas to quantify the woody resources mainly for strategic planning. Tables 1 and 2 show summary statistics for various sampled areas within the Savannah and Woodland vegetation, from Forest Inventory reports that are available at the Directorate of Forestry, Savannah vegetation occupy approximately 64 % (about 53 million ha) of the nation's land area. They vary tremendously, from desert shrubs in the Western and Southern parts of the country which support large livestock and game populations, to Mopane trees in the North and Northwest. Mopane is also found in East Caprivi region. In 1997 an area of 8 212 447 ha, in the Woody Savannah and Woodland and Camelthorn Savannah vegetation zone, was inventoried covering eastern and southern parts of Tsumkwe district, northern parts of Otjinene district and eastern parts of Okakarara districts. Forty-one (41) species were enumerated. The dominant height is about 16.5 m. There is about 101 stems/ha and the 3 mean tree volume including branches for all species is 4.2 m /ha. The average dry biomass including branches for all species is 3.2 tons/ha (see Table 1). Timber species such as P. Angolensis and B. Plurijuga are not found in these areas. Woodlands occupy approximately 20 % (about 16 million ha) of the nation's land area. They vary from savannah trees and woodlands in the North-Central Caving Region, Capri strip in the Northeast and Waterberg Plateau in the South, and riverine woodlands that constitute important dry season grazing, watershed protection; to large trees in the Erongo mountains. Riverine woodlands are rich in plant and animal biological diversity. From a forestry point of view, woodlands dominated by Pterocarpus angolensis, Baikiaea plurijuga and Burkea africana are the most valuable. A Pterocarpus-Burkea dominated woodland covering an area of 607 949 ha was inventoried in 1996 in West Tsumkwe district (Tables 1 and 2). The estimated area of woodland where P. angolensis or B. africana is the first or second dominant species is 316 860 ha or 52.1% of the area. Fifty-three (53) species were recorded. The dominant height is about 22.3 m. There is about 99 stems/ha and the average tree volume including 3 branches for all species is 17.8 m /ha. There are about 18 P. angolensis and 458 B. africana seedlings per hectare. Most of the P. angolensis seedlings are less than 1.5 m high. The mean saw 3 log volume of P. angolensis trees is 0.31 m /ha or an equivalent average of 1 tree per ha. The average dry biomass including branches for all species is 12.5 tons/ha. A Baikiaea-Pterocarpus-Burkea dominated woodland was inventoried in Kavango Region in 1997. The total area inventoried is 17 815 ha. More than 80% of the area was dominated by Baikiaea-Pterocarpus. Twenty-three (23) species were recorded. The dominant height is about 13.2 m. There is about 114 stems/ha and the mean tree volume including branches for all species is 38.
m /ha. The mean saw log volume of P. angolensis trees is 0.65 m /ha and B. Plurijuga 0.28 m /ha or an equivalent average of 1 tree per ha for both species. The average dry biomass including branches for all species is 20.6 tons/ha (See Tables 1 and 2).

Notes on Table 2: Timber volume means the volume of the main tree trunk excluding branch wood. * P. angolensis and B. plurijuga were not found in the sample in these areas. **There is a little bit of Baikiaea plurijuga in the north west of Omusati Region, in Uunkolokadhi Community Forest. Riverine Woodlands are important dry season grazing areas and support a variety of plants and animals, including the human populations that directly depend on them. The ecological value of the ephemeral rivers such as Kuiseb, Huab and Swakop in draining and giving life to the Namib Desert is one of the most outstanding features of Namibia. The agricultural value of the Kunene, Kavango, Kwando, Chobe and the Zambezi rivers in the northern regions and the Orange River in the south are also crucial. Forest inventories still need to be carried out also in the Riverine Woodlands.
Wood products The Savannah and Woodland natural forest resources are being exploited for: commercial timber production for domestic and export markets; fuelwood (firewood and charcoal) for selected domestic and export markets; raw material (mopane roots) for export markets in ornamental wood; raw material for domestic wood carving industry; and wood mainly for domestic fencing and construction in rural communities. Prices charged for harvesting forest products are shown in Appendix.
The Directorate of Forestry estimates the current total economic value of forest resources exploitation to be N$ 1058.2 million per annum. A breakdown of this estimate into various common uses of forest resources is given in Table.
The main wood-products produced, consumed and traded in Namibia are sawn timber, firewood, charcoal, mopane roots, wood for carvings (curios) and poles for fencing and construction. Other wood products such as wood based panels, transmission poles, paper and paperboard etc are imported into the country. However, data on local production, consumption and trade, including trends during the last 5 years are not readily available. Available import/export data are shown in Tables 7a, 7b, 8, 9a and 9b. Sawn timber: The forestry industry is not very strong in Namibia. One of the major constraints in the development of a viable forestry industry is the inadequate forest resources and an environment not conducive to large industrial plantations. Most of the timber produced locally from Namibian sawmills is mainly used for furniture 3 production. Between 1993-95 about 4 410 m of sawntimber were produced. Klaeboe and Omwami 1997 reported that softwoods imports, mainly from South Africa, in 1996 3 were estimated at 25 000 m valued at N$ 25 million. However, it is unknown whether this is roundwood or sawnwood. On the other hand data from Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS), Tables 7a and 7b, show that about 31000 m3of soft sawnwood valued at N$47 million were imported between 1995-99. For the same period 4800 m3 of sawn hardwood valued at N$14.7 million was imported.
Charcoal: Namibia's charcoal industry is one of the well-organised in Africa. Most of the commercial charcoal is made from bush encroachment species such as Acacia mellifera. A process has started to certify that the charcoal production conforms to environmental and sustainable management standards. This charcoal production is not associated with deforestation, but to remove unwanted bush on beef production farms. In 1997/98 13 537 tons and 433 tons of charcoal (DoF 1997/98 Annual Report) were exported to South Africa and Europe respectively. The size of the domestic market for charcoal is unknown. An estimate, probably, on the high side, is that this market is about 1000 tons annually with a retail value of N$1.5 million. The export sales in 1996 is estimated at 6 000 tons to Europe and South Africa (Klaeboe and Omwami 1997). According to CBS 12000 tons were exported in 1997 while between 1997-999 a total of 25700 tons were exported (Tables 7b). Firewood: Firewood is traded both in the formal and informal markets. However, data on the quantities and value of the firewood traded is not readily available. The total firewood consumption in Namibia in 1996 was estimated at 672 331 tons valued at N$ 103 899 000 (See Table 4). It is estimated that the total firewood consumption in Namibia will be 1 071 500 tons in the year 2006. 3 Between 1997-99 over 1 500 m (See Table 9b) were exported. Mopane roots: Mopane roots, harvested from Colophospermum mopane, are used as ornaments in fish aquaria and for decorative purposes. It is estimated that about 900 tons of mopane roots are harvested annually. The estimated quantity and value of mopane roots exported in 1996 is 625 000 Kg valued at N$ 1 242 000 (Table 5). In 1997/98 four hundred and thirty six (436), tons of Mopane roots were exported to South Africa, 29 tons to United States and 152 tons to Europe. Other exported roots, including mopane roots, are shown in Table.
According to the Directorate of forestry's forest permit system, 15000 tons of mopane roots were exported between 1997-1999. Carvings (curios): In Kavango and Caprivi Regions, local organisations are involved in making curios for sale to tourists. Individuals obtain licences from the Directorate of forestry to cut trees or collect dead material for such activities. No data is readily available on the number or volume of trees used for curio production, the value (N$) and quantity of curios produced and traded. It is estimated that the carvers use a total of 440 tons of wood annually. About 38 tons in 1997and 2 tons in 1998 of ornamentals (including curios) were exported (Table 8). Poles for construction and fencing: The amount of poles for construction and fencing mainly in northern Namibia was estimated at 4 602 000 cubic meters in 1996, corresponding to about 3.3 million tons (Klaeboe and Omwami 1997). It takes about 9.5 years to replace used poles. It is 3 estimated that by the year 2006 the consumption of poles will decrease to about 4 395 000 m or 3.15 million tons due to use of substitutes for poles. Poles for transmission: Namibia needs transmission poles for its electrical grid and telecommunications system. Since the country does not have plantations to supply the poles, they are imported. Between 1993-95 a total of about 15 000 poles were imported.
Imports and exports Since Namibia does not have wood industries such as pulp and paper, particleboard etc., these wood.
products are imported. Among the main wood products imported are; Chipwood, Fibre board, Household and Sanitary, Newsprint, Paper and Paperboard, Particle board, Plywood, Printed Matter, Pulp (Chemical, Mechanical, Semi Chemical), Roundwood, Sawnwood (Hard and Soft), Sleepers, Veneer sheets, Wafer board, Woodwool, and Wrapping and Packaging. Wood products worth a total of N$1.93 billion (CIF) were imported into the country between 19953 1999 (Table 7a). A total of 35700 tons of assorted wood products and about 99000 m of Chipwood, fuelwood, roundwood, sawnwood and sleepers were imported (Table 7b). Wood products worth N$314.3 million were exported (Table 9a). Among the locally produced wood products, charcoal is Namibia's main wood product export. Over 25700 tons valued at N$23.6 million were exported between 1997-99 (Tables 9a and 9b). Most of the other wood products exported seem to be re-exports or goods in transit through the country.
Current Status of National Forestry Statistics related to Wood-products.
Type of information presently collected at local and national level related to woodproducts In case of the Forest Permit System the following information is collected: Firewood, in Tons; Charcoal, in Tons; Mopane Roots, in Tons; Ornamentals (including Curios), in Tons and no. of pieces, Poles, in Tons and no. of pieces; Timber, in m3 and Tons. Other information collected includes number of timber logs produced, and volume of sawn timber. The National Planning Commission Secretariat (Central Bureau of statistics), Customs and Excise collect import/export data on various wood products including paper and paper board, plywood, sawntimber, fibreboard, particle board etc. The main wood products categories recorded are: Chipwood, Fibre board, Household and Sanitary, Newsprint, Paper and Paperboard, Particle board, Plywood, Printed Matter, Pulp (Chemical, Mechanical, Semi Chemical), Roundwood, Sawnwood (Hard and Soft), Sleepers, Veneer sheets, Wafer board, Woodwool, and Wrapping and Packaging.

Existing methodologies for data collection Direct measurement. For example, the number of logs cut in the field for concessions and from individual permit holders are recorded on forms. Data recorded on forest permits, e.g. transport, harvest and export permits. The permits are issued by Directorate of Forestry officials Measurement of sawn timber produced from sawmills. Count of furniture produced. Border checkpoints for Customs and Excise. Here various wood products imported and exported are recorded on customs forms. Ad hoc wood consumption surveys. Existing methods for data compilation, validation and dissemination.
Presently, there are no obvious routine mechanisms for data compilation, validation and dissemination. The Directorate of Forestry disseminates information through its annual reports (Table 8).
Ministries, departments, agencies, organisations, NGO's and other national institutions involved in collection, analysis and dissemination of data related to wood-products. The following are the main institutions involved in collection, analysis and dissemination of data related to wood-products: · Ministry of Environment and Tourism (Directorate of Forestry). Data on forest permit issues is collected and disseminated through the directorate's annual reports. · Ministry of Trade and Industry (Import/Export Permits). They have a list of companies dealing.
in wood products trade in Namibia. Ministry of Finance (Customs and Excise). They record import/export data. National Planning Commission Secretariat (Central Bureau of Statistics). They have a database of import/export data obtained from Customs and Excise. The most important wood-products produced, consumed and traded.
Although the contribution of the forestry sector to GDP has not yet been adequately assessed, wood products play a significant role in the Namibian economy. The Directorate of Forestry estimates the current total economic value of forest resources exploitation to be N$1058.2 million per annum. A breakdown of this estimate into various common uses of forest resources is given in Table.

Source: Namibia Forestry Strategic Plan 1996 The main wood-products produced, consumed and traded in Namibia are sawn timber, firewood, charcoal, mopane roots, wood for carvings (curios) and poles for fencing and construction. Sawn timber: The forestry industry is not very strong in Namibia. One of the major constraints in the development of a viable forestry industry is the inadequate forest resources. Forest resources are mainly found in the north east of the country, in Kavango and Caprivi Regions. The most sought after and over exploited commercial species, Pterocarpus angolensis, does not regenerate very well. Most of the timber produced from Namibian sawmills is mainly used for furniture production.
Between 1993-95 about 4 410 m of sawntimber were produced. Softwoods imports, mainly from South Africa, in 1996 were estimated at 25 000 m valued at N$ 25 million (Kleabo and Omwami 1997). However, it unknown whether this is round or sawnwood or both. The CBS data (Table 7a and 7b) show that between 1995-99 about 31100 m3 soft sawnwood were imported. During the same period over 4800 m3 sawn hardwood were imported. Furniture/Joinery: There are several wood working shops involved in furniture making. The main local species used is Pterocarpus angolensis. Some of the timber is imported. Data on quantities and value (N$) of furniture/joinery products is not readily available. Charcoal: Namibia's charcoal industry is one of the well-organised in Africa. Most of the commercial charcoal is made from bush encroachment species such as Acacia mellifera. A process has started to certify the charcoal. It is not associated with deforestation, but to remove unwanted bush on beef production farms. In 1997/98 13 537 tons and 433 tons of charcoal were exported to South Africa and Europe respectively. The size of the domestic market for charcoal is unknown. An estimate, probably, on the high side, is that this market is about 1000 tons annually with a retail value of N$1.5 million. The charcoal export in 1996 is estimated at 6 000 tons, to Europe and South Africa. The Directorate of Forestry permits system shows that over 61000 tons of charcoal was exported between 1997-99 (Table 8). Data from the CBS (Table 9b) shows that about 25700 tons were exported between 1997-99. Firewood: Firewood is traded both in the formal and informal markets. However, data on the quantities and value of the firewood traded is not readily available. Table 4 shows the total firewood consumption in Namibia in 1996. About 670000 tons (or 924000 m3) worth N$104 million of firewood were consumed. Over 1300 m3 valued at N$2.7 million were imported between 1995-99 (Tables 7a and 7b).

It is estimated that the total firewood consumption in Namibia will be 1 071 500 tons in the year 2006. Mopane roots: Mopane roots, harvested from Colophospermum mopane, are used as ornaments in fish aquaria and for decorative purposes. In 1997/98 four hundred and thirty six (436) tons of Mopane roots were exported to South Africa, 29 tons to United States and 152 tons to Europe. It is estimated that about 900 tons of mopane roots are harvested annually. Table 5 shows the estimated quantity and value of mopane roots in 1996.

The Directorate of Forestry permit system indicates that 1500 tons of mopane roots were exported between 1997-99. This is approximately 500 tons annually. It must be borne in mind that the data capture for the permit system is still on going. Some of the data on the datasheets has not yet been entered into the computer. Carvings (curios): In Kavango and Caprivi Regions, local organisations are involved in making curios for sale to tourists. Individuals obtain licences from the Directorate of forestry to cut trees or collect dead material for such activities. No data is readily available on the number or volume of trees used for curio production, neither the value (N$) and tonnes of curios produced and traded. It is estimated that the carvers use a total of 440 tons of wood annually (Klaeboe and Omwami 1997). Poles for construction and fencing: Table 6 shows the amount of poles for construction and fencing mainly in northern Namibia. Table 6: Standing volume of wood in homesteads 1996 (Klaeboe and Omwami 1997).
