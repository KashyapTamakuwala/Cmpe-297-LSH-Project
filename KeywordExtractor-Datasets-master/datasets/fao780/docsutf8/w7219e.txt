<title>VIT FISHERIES ANALYSIS PROGRAM. VIT: software for fishery analysis User's manual</title>
<section>1</section>
1. INTRODUCTION
Fisheries biologists have at their disposal today a number of programs and software packages, specially for IBM-PC compatibles, that perform virtual population analysis or other analysis normally used in population dynamics (Sims, 1985; Hightower, 1986; Sparre, 1987; Gayanilo et al.,1988; Mesnil, 1988). Other unpublished programs also exist in places where population dynamics work is carried out. For some fisheries, however, it is impossible to obtain all of the necessary data to run one of these programs (generally the catch matrix in numbers of individuals by age and year is required). In such fisheries the scientist is confronted with the choice of waiting to have a sufficiently long time series to, in the future, apply the above mentioned methods or try to use the existing data to say something about the population under study. Many times, the scientist is also obliged to advise fishery managers that, needless to say, cannot wait to take decisions.
In order to carry out these calculations of the dynamics of the population it is necessary to work with restrictive hypotheses and the errors associated with them. When long time series are not available, the first hypothesis that has to be used is that of steady state or equilibrium. That means assuming that the size structure of the stock is identical to that of each and everyone of its cohorts, thus referring to pseudocohorts instead of cohorts. Obviously, we are talking about a restrictive hypothesis because, in general, the population is not in equilibrium given that neither the recruiting nor the mortality are a constant. Knowing the errors associated with accepting such hypotheses does not eliminate them, but it allows to make an adequate interpretation of the results and can produce an objective assessment of the studied population.

2. OBJECTIVES AND STRUCTURE OF THE PROGRAM
The principal objective of VIT is to study the population dynamics of a population subject to fishing effort. This study is done by an analysis of pseudocohorts on size frequency data, given knowledge of certain parameters. More specifically, VIT endeavors to study the exploitation rate, the interaction between fishing gears and the reaction to changes in the exploitation pattern, through virtual population and yield-per-recruit analysis. The theory behind these analysis and the equations used are presented in section 5.
Models used in this package are those traditionally employed in population dynamics, with some modifications that are presented in the text. Descriptions of these models can be found, among other places, in Beverton and Holt (1957), Ricker (1975), Laurec and Le Guen (1981), Pitcher and Hart (1982) and Sparre et al. (1989).
The program conducts a virtual population analysis (VPA), and assuming a steady state, reconstructs the population. There are two methods in the analysis of pseudocohorts, depending on the equation used to relate catch and fishing mortality to population numbers: the classic catch equation (Gulland 1965) or the cohort analysis Pope's equation (Pope 1972) (and section 5.4 further in this volume). Program VIT allows the use of both methods (VPA and cohort analysis) upon both catch-at-age and catch-at-length data.
Once the population has been reconstructed, it is possible to carry out yield-per-recruit analysis and studies of the transient effects of changes in the fishing pattern or the level of fishing effort. These later analyses follow the evolution of a population that is not in equilibrium. It is also possible to do sensitivity analysis on model parameters. Because the hypothesis of a steady state is central to the mechanics of the program it is not possible to work with time series of data.
Therefore, to carry out the various analyses it is necessary to have age or size frequency distributions (up to a maximum of 200 classes), for one or more fishing gears (up to a maximum of 4). It is assumed that such distributions are representative of the real age or size distributions of the catch for the time period used in the analysis (generally one year). Although the size interval of age or size classes is obviously fixed, it is possible to have an open final class, different from the others, which includes all individuals above a certain value (size or age) and that is denominated the plus (+) class.
In addition to the above mentioned data it is necessary to enter a number of parameters: growth, length-weight relationship, natural and fishing mortalities, percentage mature by size or age, and proportions caught by each fishing gear.
The program is structured in two parts, the first one relates to data input (frequency distribution of size or age, and initial parameters) and the choice of population assessment method to be used: VPA or cohort analysis (section 3.3). The method chosen and the population data input in this first part, except the parameters, cannot be modified during a run . Within this first part it is necessary to specify the output filename which contains the complete results of the analysis. This name is unique for each run of the program (section 4.4).
It is at this point, as long as the parameters are not modified and before the program goes into its second part, that the population rebuild by VPA or cohort analysis is stored in the computer memory for future use.
The second part starts with the appearance of the Main menu on the screen. The different options of this menu allow to save the general information (data and filenames) entered in part one (section 3.4.1), to view a synthesis of the results of the population assessment (section 3.4.2), to obtain the full results of the VPA or cohort analysis (within the output file) (section 3.4.4.1), to modify the parameters (sections 3.4.3 and 3.4.4.2), and execute any of the analyses through the different menus (section 3.4). Results of the analysis yield per recruit (section 3.4.5), transition (section 3.4.6) and sensitivity (section 3.4.7) will appear in the output file. Transient analysis require an age-structured population, that can be obtained by transforming size frequencies into age frequencies through the size to age menu (section 3.4.8). During the program run, the options that appear in the Main menu can be repeated as many times as required, because all options revert to the
main menu. Particularly, every time a parameter is modified the program carries out a new VPA (from now we will refer to the analysis method, VPA or cohort analysis simply as VPA, considering its more general sense) before it returns to the Main menu.
In general the results of the analysis are not shown on the screen, except for the summary information on the evaluation results (section 3.4.2) or information on how to make modifications to the input. To see the results in full it is necessary to exit the program and check the output file (section 4.4).
The output file does not contain any graphs, instead it has numeric tables with comments. However, this file was designed so that it can be easily imported into a spreadsheet program for graphing.
Size frequency data have to be entered in a file according to a format specified in section 4.1. Initial parameters describing growth, length-weight relationship, natural and fishing mortality and catch proportions by gear can be entered from the keyboard or by creating a formatted parameter file as it is described in section 4.2. Certain options of the transition analyses require new information which has to be provided in another file (section 4.3). All extra input required for the rest of the analyses has to be entered with the keyboard.
In summary, to operate the program it is sufficient (i) to have a size or age frequency data file, (ii) to know or to choose a set of initial parameters, and (iii) to decide on the population assessment method to be used. The following table summarizes the requirements for the use of this program.

3. USER'S MANUAL
3.1 Introduction
In this chapter we will be talking about how to use the VIT program and its options. The program has two parts: the first one is the initial process, the reading of the data, the choice of evaluation method of the population and the introduction of the initial parameter sets (section 3.3). The second part, centered on the main menu, allows you to modify the parameters, go from sizes to ages, make several estimates and obtain results from all the different options (section 3.4).
Once all of the data requested in the first part has been provided, the Main menu appears. It is important to remember that the last operation of the first part is running the VPA with the information given. This means that when the Main menu appears, the population reconstructed by the VPA is already in the computer memory.
All the work done throughout a run of the program is written on a single file, called the output file (see section 3.3) even though it is also referred to as print file. This file can normally be printed without problem because it doesn't include the characters of the ASCII extended code (beyond character 127 or 7 bits). The alphanumeric comments and titles of this file are within double quotes so that they can be imported directly to a spreadsheet program as a numerical file.
The VIT program works in an interactive mode, based on menus with options or direct questions. We have tried showing the maximum information on screen, properly condensed, so that the user can get what he needs without having to refer to the manual as he goes. For more information, specially for the more complex options, we recommend having a look at the manual.
Throughout this chapter, we describe how to start and access all the different options of the program. In many cases we use for that purpose the example files distributed with the VIT program (see from section 4 onwards).
3.2 Useful tips and hints
Before running VIT we recommend taking certain precautions to avoid unwelcome surprises such as data loss and aborted runs:
STARTUP DIAGRAM
1. Keep backup copies of data files in a different directory or another disk.
2. Backup all output files after each session.
3. Properly edit input files because there is no initial checking and incorrect data can abort program execution or produce erroneous results. For instance the data file can not contain size or age groups with zero frequency for all fishing gears (see section 4).
4. Check that the parameter set entered corresponds to the data being used. For instance, for age-structured data, it has to be checked that there are no age groups with lower limits smaller than t0. Also, for size-structured data, it has to be checked that L(inf) is not smaller than the upper limit of the largest size group (see sections 3.3 and 4.2).
During a run it is not possible to exit to the operating system and then continue running the program. Hence although the initial phase is quick, we recommend to have all files ready before starting.
To get used to the program and its performance, we recommend to run it several times with the examples provided and follow the manual. Before serious analysis are attempted, we also recommend to "play" a little bit with the program and your own data.
In many of the options it is possible to change parameters or those factors that affect them. It is interesting to take advantage of these options to test the resilience of the population. However, we do not recommend radical changes in these parameters, factors or the use of extravagant values, because it is possible to produce errors that stop the program's execution.
Given that the program has no graphic output we recommend using a spreadsheet for graphing and other calculations, as we noted in the introduction (section 3.1).
3.3 Program startup
The following explains how to execute program VIT. It is necessary to first install VIT.EXE in a directory included in the PATH, or in the default directory and execute it by typing at the system prompt:
VIT
We will then see the following message [p1]:
Â¦ Enter data file name Â¦
to this we will answer with the name of the input data file (see section 4), for example:
DADES.DAT
If there is no file with this name, the program will stop executing. If there is such a file, then the following message will appear on the screen [p2]:
Â¦ Enter the output file name Â¦
Â¦ (Default: EXVIT.PRN) Â¦
to this we will answer with the output filename where the program will write all results. (see section 4.4), for example:
OUT.PRN
If no output filename is typed in, the program uses a default file named EXVIT.PRN, and does not check if this file already exists or not. Therefore there is a risk that useful information is inadvertently destroyed (see section 3.2). On the other hand if an output filename is typed in, as in the example above, it has to be a new filename, otherwise the program rejects it and requests a name again.
Continuing with the initial process, the program requests the type of population analysis to be performed with the next message [p3]:
Â¦ 1 Performs a Standard VPA (Catch Equation) Â¦
Â¦ 2 Performs the Cohort Analysis (Pope) Â¦
Â¦ Enter your option Â¦
To this we will answer:
or 2
depending on whether we want to do an analysis based on the catch equation or on the method of cohort analysis of Pope (see section 5.4). Any other response will lead to a repeat of the above message.
After this the program requests the required parameters with the following message [p4]:
Â¦ 1 The Parameters are in a File Â¦
Â¦ 2 To Enter the Parameters by Keyboard Â¦
Â¦ Enter your option Â¦
If we type in
the program will request the name of the parameter file (see section 4.2) with the following message [p5]:
Â¦ Enter the parameter file name Â¦
we can then type in the name of the required parameter file, for example
PARAM.INI
If the filename typed in does not exist, the program will again request the name of the parameter file.
If all parameters are to be entered through the keyboard we should reply to [4] with
and enter each parameter as requested by the program. The entry procedures are no different to those from the menu of Parameter modification, explained in detailed in section 3.4.3.
As recommended in the previous section, the parameters have to be compatible with the data because otherwise not only we will obtain erroneous results but other problems may also surface. One possible incompatibility may appear with the parameter t0, when working with age structured data if t0 is positive and higher than the lower limit of the first age class (see section 4.2). In such a case, although the program may continue, some estimated lengths and weights will be negative.That is why the following message appears before the program proceeds [p6]:
Â¦ WARNING! Â¦
Â¦ The lower limit of the first Â¦
Â¦ age class is lower than t0. Â¦
Â¦ Weights of the first age classes Â¦
Â¦ can be negative. Â¦
Â¦ Press return to continue Â¦
This problem can occur in the option to transform data from a size distribution to an age distribution (option 8 of the Main menu, see section 3.4.8).
On the other hand, when we work with size structured data, it is possible to have a growth parameter L(inf) which is incompatible with the largest size class, because in this class there are individuals that are larger than L(inf) (See section 4.2). In this case the program can not continue and outputs an error message with the minimum value of L(inf) required, for example [p7]:
Â¦ ERROR! Â¦
Â¦ L(inf) is too much low. Â¦
Â¦ It must be greater than Â¦
If the parameters were read from a file, the program stops executing. If, however, the parameters are being entered through the keyboard, the program requests them again.
When the process of parameter input is completed, one way or the other and without problems, the information screen corresponding to option 1 in the Main Menu [p10] appears (for a detailed explanation see section 3.4.1). In the example it would be:
+- Main Option 1 ------------------------------------+
Â¦ G E N E R A L I N F O R M A T I O N Â¦
Â¦ Input File: DADES.DAT Â¦
Â¦ Test Data: lengths Â¦
Â¦ Num. of Classes: 39 Num. of Gears: 2 Â¦
Â¦ Data arranged by LENGTHS VPA Method: STANDARD Â¦
Â¦ Lower Limits of: First Class Last Class Â¦
Â¦ Incr. per Class: 2.000 Class + ? NO Â¦
Â¦ Output File: OUT.PRN Â¦
Â¦ Parameter File: PARAM.INI Â¦
If we then type
<enter>
we will see the Main menu on the screen.
3.4 Main menu options
The Main menu has nine options, one of which is hidden. The hidden option depends on the structure of the data file. If the data file is structured by ages, the following menu will appear [p8]:
+-------------------- MAIN MENU ---------------------+
Â¦ 1 General Information Â¦
Â¦ 2 Results Â¦
Â¦ 3 Parameter editing Â¦
Â¦ 4 VPA Â¦
Â¦ 5 Yield per recruit analysis Â¦
Â¦ 6 Transition analysis Â¦
Â¦ 7 Sensitivity analysis Â¦
Â¦ 0 EXIT Â¦
If the data is structured by sizes, it is not possible to run transition analysis (6). There is however, a new option (8) which converts data from sizes to ages and creates a new file with which the program can be run again (section 4.5). Then the menu which appears on the screen is as follows [p9]:
+-------------------- MAIN MENU ---------------------+
Â¦ 1 General Information Â¦
Â¦ 2 Results Â¦
Â¦ 3 Parameter editing Â¦
Â¦ 4 VPA Â¦
Â¦ 5 Yield per recruit analysis Â¦
Â¦ 7 Sensitivity analysis Â¦
Â¦ 8 Creates a data file by ages Â¦
Â¦ 0 EXIT Â¦
In both cases option 9, which allows changing the precision of the VPA calculations, is hidden. Certain cases require changing this precision whenever there are problems with the approximation algorithms (see section 3.4.9).
From this menu all options can be accessed, and once these are completed the program returns to it. Option 0 is used to stop program execution and return to the operating system. It is possible to return to this menu from any of the options by selecting 0, except in cases where this return happens automatically after the execution of the option. See menu descriptions in each case.
All options, except for the first one, are interactive. The first two only give information to the user. Options 3 and 4 allow for parameter modification. Options 4, 5, 6 and 7 conduct analyses whose results are written into the output file. Option 8 creates new parameter and data files, and option 9 (hidden) allows modification of the precision of VPA calculations.
Parameters are written into the output file immediately before the first set of results. After any modification, parameters are also written to the output file before the next set of results. If parameters have been modified but no analysis have been run, changes are not recorded in the output file. Changes appear in the output file only after the modified parameters are used in an analysis. Therefore, to find out which parameters have been used for any particular analysis, is enough to look in the output file at the parameters immediately above the results.
DIAGRAM OF MAIN MENU
3.4.1 General information
If we select in the Main Menu:
we will see the information screen, that summarizing the input data entered during program startup (section 3.3).
We now describe all the information presented in the general information screen [p10]:

All information described above for the numbers 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9 and 10 is obtained directly from the input data file. After reading the screen, it is possible to return to the Main Menu by pressing
<enter>
3.4.2 Displaying the Results
If in the Main menu we select
we will see the results menu, that contains the options for presenting the parameters and results of the population analysis (VPA or cohort analysis) [p11]:
+-- Main Option 2 -----------------------------------+
Â¦ RESULTS Â¦
Â¦ 1 Parameters (Recall) Â¦
Â¦ 2 Catch data Â¦
Â¦ 3 Length, Age and Weight classes Â¦
Â¦ 4 Number of individuals Â¦
Â¦ 5 Mortalities Â¦
Â¦ 6 Summary of Global Results Â¦
Â¦ 0 Exit to Main Menu Â¦
It is possible to return to the Results menu [p11] from any of the options by pressing
<enter>
after the information has been presented on the screen.
From this menu we can return to the Main menu by entering:
It is not possible to print results or write them to the output file from the Visualizing Results menu, this can be done from option 4 in the Main menu (see section 3.4.4).
3.4.2.1 Parameters
If in the results menu [p11] we select
we will see the list of parameters. Although this list does not correspond to any result, it seemed appropriate to be able to review parameters from this menu.
To edit parameter values it is necessary to go to the Main menu and select 3 (see section 3.4.3).
In the example, we will see the following message on the screen:
L(inf) = 95.00
K = .9000E-01
t0 = -.6000
a = .4000E-02
b = 3.100
M = .1500
Fterm = .5000
Prop. for Gears: 1883.464 1976.399
Finally we get the following question:
Do you want also to see the Proportion Mature? (y/n)
If we answer with
y
we will see listed on the screen the proportion mature by size class. The reason behind this question is that this list is normally very long and if it was displayed automatically it would scroll out of the screen the information above.
In the example, we will see the following on the screen:
Class: 1 Length = 7.000 Prop. Mature = .000
Class: 2 Length = 9.000 Prop. Mature = .000
Class: 3 Length = 11.000 Prop. Mature = .000

3.4.2.6 Summary of global results
If in the Results menu [p11] we select
we will see a summary of the global population results calculated from the VPA and the Yield-per-recruit: overall total, fishing, and fishing per gear mortalities average age and length of the population, critical age and length (corresponding to the maximum biomass B(max), see section 5.7), annual average population number and annual average biomass, recruitment, total yield-per-recruit and yield-per-recruit by fishing gear, and biomass per recruit. A table of biomass balance is also presented (see last paragraph of section 4.4.3.4). In the example we will see
mean Z ................... .4302
mean F: total & per gear .2802 .0868 .1934
global F: total & per gear .2776 .2418 .0358
age (mean) ............... 2.6709 (critical) ........... 5.6766
length (mean) ............ 22.7989 (critical) ........... 41.0000
mean individuals at sea .. .4867E+07
mean biomass (B(mean)) ... .7255E+09
recruitment (number) ..... .2081E+07
Y/R ...................... 96.1009
Y/R per gear ............. 36.5183 59.5826
B/R ...................... 348.5973
General Biomass Equation Total Biomass Balance (D) = .3088E+09
Biomass Percent
Inputs Recruitment .3469E+07 1.1%
Growth .3054E+09 98.9%
Outputs Natural dead .1088E+09 35.2%
Biomass caught .2000E+09 64.8%
R/B(mean) = .5% D/B(mean) = 42.6% (turnover)
B(max)/B(mean) = 15.0% B(max)/D = 35.3%
We have to note that if we are dealing with a + group, these results can be misleading because most of the above averages are time-integrated values (see section 5.5).
3.4.3 Parameter editing
If in the Main menu we select
we will see the parameter editing screen [p12]

The different options of this menu show the values of the different parameters and ask you if you want to change them.
Do you want to change them? (y/n)
If you answer
y
the program will request new parameter values. To enter these values, follow the procedures outlined to enter the initial parameter set (see section 3.3).
If you do not want to modify the parameters enter
n
in which case the program will return to the Parameter Menu.
We now describe in detail all the options of this menu:
3.4.3.1 Growth
If in the Parameter menu we enter
we will see on the screen the list of Von Bertalanffy growth parameters, L(inf), k and t0 (section 5.3). In the example we will see:
The Growth Parameters are
L(inf) = 95.00
K = .9000E-01
t0 = -.6000
Do you want to change them? (y/n)
If we have requested to modify the parameters, we will see
Enter the Growth parameters
L(inf) K t(0)
Note that we will have to enter the three values even if we only wanted to modify one of them. This applies to all options of the Parameter Menu.
The values of the growth parameters have to be consistent with the data, as it is explained in the chapters referring to parameter entry. This is specially the case of the measurement units (sections 3.3 and 4.2). If there is a problem with t0 and L(inf) a message requesting new parameter values will appear on the screen. This procedure is detailed in section 3.3.
3.4.3.2 Length-Weight Relationship
If in the Parameter menu [p12] we enter
we will see the values of a and b from the length-weight relationship. In the example we will see:
The Length-Weight relationship Parameters are
a = .4000E-02
b = 3.100
Do you want change them ? (y/n)
And if we have asked to modify the parameter values we will see
Enter the Parameters of the Length-Weight relationship
a b
As previously mentioned, we need to enter both values even if only one was to be modified.
3.4.3.3 Natural Mortality
If in the Parameter menu [p12] we enter
we will see the value given to natural mortality M. In the example we will see:
The Natural Mortality is
M = .1500
Do you want to change it? (y/n)
And will request a new value if we have asked to change it.
3.4.3.4 Terminal Fishing Mortality
If in the Parameter menu [p12] we enter
we will see the value of fishing mortality corresponding to the last class, Fterm. In the example we will see:
The Terminal Fishing Mortality is
Fterm = .5000
Do you want to change it (y/n)
And will demand a new value if requested.
This parameter can also be modified from option 4 in the Main menu (Section 3.4.4.2).
3.4.3.5 Proportions by fishing gear
If in the Parameter menu [p12] we enter
we will see the proportions per fishing gear and will be asked if we want to change them (for more detail see section 4.2). In the example we will see:
The Proportion factors are
Gear 1 Prop. factor = 1883.464
Gear 2 Prop. factor = 1976.399
Do you want to change them? (y/n)
If we want to change these values we will be asked if we wan
