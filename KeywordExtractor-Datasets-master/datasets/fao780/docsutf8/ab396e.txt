SOCIO-ECONOMIC AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS.
Geographic position of the country Kenya lies approximately between latitude 4o 40'N, and 4o 30'S and between longitudes 34oE and 41oE. The total area is 582,600 km2. Kenya is boarded by Sudan, Ethiopia and Somali to the northwest, north and east respectively. To the west is Uganda, south Tanzania and southeast is the Indian Ocean. Lake Victoria is shared by Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda. Kenya has a population of about 29.6 million people (2000). About 68% of Kenya's population live in the rural areas. The capital of Kenya is Nairobi and has a population of about 3 million people.
Socio-economic information Kenya's population density is about 52 persons/km². The rate of population increase has been 2.0% (1995-2000). Agriculture is the main occupation of the Kenya population. Coffee and tea are the main cash and export crops. Sugar, fruits, horticultural crops and floriculture have become important export crops. Livestock farming for export of meat and daily products has recently decreased but production is enough for national consumption. Fish production from mainly Lake Victoria and less from Indian Ocean is exported to the EU countries and Japan. Tourism is an important and well-developed industry in Kenya The GNP per capita for Kenya is US$330 and the annual growth rate of GDP is 2.1% (1999).
Ecological information Figure 1 shows the agro-climatic zone map of Kenya. The described zones are a reflection of the rainfall distribution pattern in the country. Approximately 80% of Kenya falls within semi-arid eco-zones and only about 20% is considered to be in the potential agricultural land area. In Kenya's dry zone, the climate is generally hot and dry. The sky is clear and daytime temperatures may rise to 38ºC. The soils are generally poor and are characterised by high sand content, low water content and low natural fertility. In the dry areas the air is dry, humidity low and the vegetation has less cover on the ground. Table 1 shows the most important climatic ecozones and corresponding vegetation. Table 1 Classification of dryland ecological zones.

The arid and semi-arid lands (ASALs) account for about 80 percent of Kenya's land surface. Much of the land falls under the lowlands, which are mostly interspaced by hills and small mountains. Figure 2 shows distribution of soils in Kenya. The map shows a wide distribution range of soil types which is mainly a reflection of the physical landscapes rising from the coral reefs at the Indian Ocean to the snow capped Mount Kenya. Soils include the very fertile volcanic soils to poorly eroded soils arising from soil erosion that causes loss of nutrients, siltation of lakes and hydroelectric dams and pollution of marine ecosystems. The soils in the dry areas are sandy, dry and are therefore prone to soil erosion by wind and especially also by sporadic torrential rains (figure 3 ).
STATE OF FOREST GENETIC RESOURCES.
Phytogeography of the country Kenya is rich in biological diversity. The country harbours over 6000 species of higher plants (including 2000 trees and shrubs). Recorded species of butterflies are 875, of birds, 1079 and 379 species of mammals (KIFCON, 1994). Most of these species of fauna are associated with forest and woody vegetation. Further more the forest contains 50% of the nation's tree species, 40% of the larger mammals and 30% of the birds (KIFCON, 1994). Kenya's forest estate totals 2.4 million ha or just under 3% of the country (KIFCON, 1994). As observed in table 1 above, four ecological zones (Fig.1) are defined in the country with different vegetation cover type and floristic composition. In addition woodlands, bushlands and wooded grasslands cover about 38.5 million ha. Farmlands and settlements take up some 10.02 million ha while forest plantations area occupies about 136,000 ha. Acacia and Commiphora spp dominates the desert thorn-scrub lands. Grazing is nomadic and is the main occupation of the local people. The low montane forests in the ASALs are dominated by tree species and in some cases such trees form closed forest vegetations. The main tree species include: Juniperus procera (cedar), Podocarpus gracilior, Olea africana, Olea hochstetteri, Lawsonia inermis, Combretum molle, Casipourea malosana, Diospyros abyssinica and Teclea simplicifolia. The deciduous woodland occurs throughout the ASALs and is dominated by Acacia tortilis. Other more notable species include: Hyphaene ventricosa, Salvadora persica, Acacia nubica on the Northwest and northern Kenya and Commiphora and Acacias in the southern parts. Deciduous and evergreen thorn bush constitute another extensive vegetation cover type. The main species in the north include: Acacia reficiens, Acacia. senegal, Euphorbia sp., Pappea capensis and Combretum molle. The dominant species of the shrubland vegetation are Acacia mellifera, Acacia senegal, Acacia reficiens and Acacia tortilis in the more northerly parts. In the south, Acacia reficiens and Commiphora sp. are the dominant species.

Threats to Forest Genetic Resources and Impact External intervention of natural forest and woodlands do impact on the state of the forest genetic resources in a positive or negative manner. Usually interventions induce certain kinds of changes to genetic processes that in turn affect the evolution and sustainability of forest ecosystems. Changes in genetic variation are attributable, in short term, to changes in the basic evolutionary processes, which are characterised by: · · · · Random genetic drift ­ the non-directed changes in genotypic frequencies among generations due to random change in small populations Selection ­ relative differences among genotypes in viability or reproductive success Migration ­ the exchange of genes between populations that differ in genotypic frequencies Mating ­ the process mediating the recombination and assortment of genes between generations.
The above evolutionary processes affect the level and distribution of genetic variation and the present state of the genetic resources is a result of their joint efforts. Human activities have influences on the above processes that affect genetic variations of the forest resources under management and use. The major threats thus on forest and woodlands resources in Kenya include: · · Excisions ­ which have decreased the size of forest and woodlands ecosystems and populations therein and therefore loss of biodiversity. Changing land-use patterns ­ mostly from natural vegetation to farming, settlement, grazing etc.
Changing lifestyles ­ which has tended to rely less on traditional methods of sustainable means of using natural vegetation. Some of these changes threaten indigenous knowledge of germplasm conservation and sustainable utilization. Lack of firm national strategies ­ for conservation of forest germplasm, training programmes to support the initiatives and appropriate and articulate supportive policy and legislative tools. Restricted use of trees to only a few species ­ which has tended to put pressure on such trees and shrub species. This trend has put a number of species in the rare and endangered categories. Low capacity to appreciate the importance of forest genetic resource ­ in future development initiatives. The public is yet to be fully sensitised on the value of forest genetic resource in forestry, agriculture, and medical, among others. Inadequate institutional frameworks ­ responsible and sensitive to the national needs for conservation and promotion of sustainable utilization of forest genetic resources.
The following human activities are more specifically elaborated to show the impact caused on forest genetic resources. Kenya forests have numerous endemics as well as threatened species. Some 150 internationally threatened wood plants in the country have been identified (Beentje, 1988). In addition, 60 inland forests and 65 coastal forests are known to harbour threatened plant species (KIFCON, 1994). Demography impact on forestlands As population increases forestland has been cleared to settle people near major towns. Forests near towns are more threatened since the population increase and density are higher than in the rural areas therefore requiring more land for expansion. While the rural population has a growth rate of 2.1%, that of the cities and major towns is above 4%. New settlements in dry areas are followed by immediate clearing of the indigenous vegetation before residents start growing trees in their now smaller compounds. This scenario cause heavy losses of populations of tree species through clearing. Currently, some 465,000 ha of land is taken up by settlements as towns and expansion of this type of land use is increasing fast. Impact of agriculture on forest lands Agriculture is the main stay of the national economy. It contributes about 30% of the GDP, produces most of the national food requirements, generate 60% of the foreign exchange earnings and provide about 70% of Kenya's agro-based industrial raw materials and almost all employment opportunities in the rural areas. Changes of land use from natural vegetation to farming as a result of increasing human population and the need for more food have greatly reduced the dry forest areas. Pressure on woodlands for cultivation, intensive grazing and settlement has continued to increase at an alarming rate. Excisions of forestland to create land for farming have become a common practice and alarmingly notable. Over the last decade or two, the rates of loss of closed forestland stood at 5.000 ha/annum and 19,000 ha per year when other types of dry woody vegetation types are included. Loss of closed forestland has increased with a proposed excision of over 80,000 ha in 2001 alone. This will mean serious impact on forest genetic resources. FAO estimates that between 1990-2000, Kenya lost 931,000 ha (93,000 ha/annum) of its forest cover (FAO, 2001).
Such excisions are scattered, some large, others small, while others are done in small and isolated forest stands. This is likely to affect the genetic structure of the forest populations and thus leading to reduction of population sizes, few individuals to seed and produce pollen needs. The source of migration of genes may be cut off causing random losses of variation by drift. Random drift of alleles will severely reduce genetic variation that may be significant for future adaptability for several generations. It is feared that the later case could be enhanced for those small populations in isolated forest stands being cleared without any considerations of the danger of erosion of forest gene pools. The situation in woody vegetation in dry areas is even worse since larger areas are being cleared to enable sustaining higher production of crops under the poor conditions for efficient agricultural practice. Furthermore even where land is left as fallow, recovery rate is very slow and the fallow period has become less and less as more population continue to migrate into the drier areas of the country. Presently some 10.02 million hectares is estimated to fall under farmland form of land use, both in mainly medium and high potential land areas. The rate of expansion of agricultural land during the last decade has been about 100,000 ha/annum. This land has come from forest land but more so from the woodland vegetation types indicating that threats on wild tree genetic resource are real now and in the future. Impact of livestock (grazing) on forest tree species and populations Livestock in the arid and semi-arid areas (ASALs) includes the donkeys, camels, cattle, sheep and goats. The dry zone support 50% of the cattle, 55% of the goats, 75% of the sheep and nearly all the camels in Kenya. In numbers, Kenya has 12 million cattle, 19 million sheep and goats, 875,000 camels, 18 million poultry and 114,000 pigs. The people living in the ASALs are mainly pastoralists, and derive their livelihood from keeping livestock. Crop farming is rare except along the permanent course of the river Tana. Apart from providing a livelihood, livestock is also a symbol of social status. With the increasing population, there has been a trend towards sedentarisation of communities. This has greatly interfered with the traditional grazing patterns. Migration of people from high potential areas into drier lands in search of space for cultivation is not only causing degradation of vegetation and causing erosion but is also changing socio-economics and general environmental situations. It is observed that grazing in forest and woodlands by livestock mostly affect regenerating species especially of those more palatable. This results in a thinning effect thus changing the population densities of the palatable species. Grazing on such species could affect genetic drift. Grazing especially along riverine systems has been found to cause physical impact on the grazed sites by altering stand structure and environmental conditions. This is a common feature along rivers in the dry areas of northern Kenya and especially along the River Tana where there is a great concentration of pastoral communities. Such changes could affect populations of potential regeneration of plants and forest-dwelling herbivores and therefore, have a negative impact on richness in biodiversity. Water in the dry lands is generally scarce, only a few rivers are perennial streams, the lakes are generally saline due to high evaporation and the major sources of reliable water are wells and bore holes established at strategic watering points. Unfortunately watering points have turned out.
to centres of vegetation and environmental degradation due to concentration of high population pressure and grazing. Forest exploitation (timber and non timber products) Use of trees is restricted to a few species in different forest/woodland types for various requirements and according to traditional uses and this has tended to place unsustainable utilization on such tree and shrub species. Such utilization concentrating on a few species (eg. Dalbergia melanoxylon, Melia volkensii, Acacia mellifera, Branchylaena huillensis, Acacia senegal, Hyphaenie copressa, Tamarindus indica, Carissa edulis, among others), has put a number of species in the endangered category. This is a serious problem especially where no measures are being put in place to revert such trend. Exploitation in forest has been through selective cutting and there are a lot of isolated poaching activities. This leads to depletion of quality timber species especially where cutting is not controlled. Operations at forest level that changes the environmental conditions of the forest or woodland will affect relative genotype viability and can also affect pollinator behaviour and other inter-species interaction. Under the restricted cutting or logging will directly impact on genetic resources of the target commercial species by changing their population age and population density. Selection favours certain genotypes over others and some genes would be lost at higher rates than would be expected by drift alone. Very strong selection of a tree species, e.g. the case of Prunus africana, Dalbergia melanoxylon or Milicia excelsa could reduce population sizes below recuperation levels. The impact will be more on reduced production and survival of these species. This observation is presently apparent and common. It is also apparent that uncontrolled cutting of a certain species or high selective cutting will also affect other non-commercial species and thus decrease biodiversity of the forest dependent plants and animal species. In isolated populations of forest stands the effect as stated earlier will be even worse. Natural forests and woodlands are important sources of non-timber forest products. More important are collection of bamboo poles, fruits, fodder, honey production, herbal medicine, bush meat, etc. In dry areas fodder collection during dry and drought periods become destructive where trees and shrubs are cut down to access canopy foliage for animals. Collection of parts of trees (bark, roots, leaves, and branches) can be destructive as is common with several species (e.g. Fagara macrophylla, Prunus africana etc) where whole tree deaths are common when large portions of stem barks are removed for herbal medicine. Collection of non-timber forest products will have varying effects on genetic evolution processes depending on the part of the plant harvested or collected for use. Harvesting of reproductive parts of a plant, tree or shrub, such as fruit or seed, reduces the effective size of pool of reproductive parents. Intensive harvesting of fruits and seeds cause severe genetic impact. Direct selection of e.g. a certain variety of a species will affect reproductive traits but the strongest genetic impact is on mating system and gene migration depending on the harvested parts. Harvesting non-productive parts such as leaves or bark for medicine, as is the case with fagara spp and Prunus africana, will have indirect selection effects on viability and.
reproductivity of affected individuals. Harvesting of whole tree/shrub for products other than timber, as is the case of shrubs cut by pastoralists to provide fodder, implies that the population size is remarkably reduced. This will have a serious genetic impact. In particular genetic drift will be affected thus causing random losses of variation. Reproduction capacity of the affected population is affected and this may impact on the genetic viability by reducing it and therefore affecting future adaptability of future generations. Other types of threats Droughts in the dry areas are common but rarely do they result in massive deaths of tree species since most of the species are adapted to such conditions. Natural disasters are not common in Kenya. The most other important threats to forests and woodland species in Kenya is forest and bush fires. The incidences of forest fires are very high especially during the drought periods. About 10,700 ha of plantations and natural forests are lost annually as a result of fire. In the process the Forest Department has been losing annually close to US$505,000 through loss of forest produce and suppression costs. This cost does not include bush fires in dry areas where timber production is not a management priority and therefore not put into cost in the computation of losses. The incidences of fire are more prevalent in dry woodland ecosystems and fire management is an important issue in Kenya but is less given the attention it deserves. Fire may cause variable effects depending on the intensity and extent in space of the fire. Severe fire may have the same effect as clearing a forest especially where large patchy openings are created as a result of fire. The patterns and sizes of such openings versus the forest cover influences genetic diversity. The major impacts are heavy mortality on the burnt species thus reduced population sizes and this would increase genetic drift. For isolated populations this means the migration rates of seed and pollen exchange are affected. Sources of migration could even be cut off, thus reducing the effectiveness of pollinators. Adverse fire may directly affect biotic dispersal agents and this may decrease migration of genes between populations. Migration may increase if the migration vectors are abiotic. A more devastating fire may affect traits that could have a direct bearing effect on fire resistant species and such action would have direct selection that indiscriminately remove all such genotypes. List of threatened species and populations At the species level it has been estimated that 39 species are currently rare, 32 are vulnerable, 20 are endangered and 1 species is feared extinct. Using local herbarium and a recent field species collection it has been established that about one third of all rare species (39 species) occur in the coastal forests. Table 3 shows general distribution of rare, vulnerable and endemic species nation-wide. Table 4 shows the case for the coastal region alone. More recently, the National Museums of Kenya in collaboration with WWF has concentrated its field survey in the coast and hence more information on this area is available (Robertson and Luke, 1995). Table 5 lists species that are known to be threatened and require urgent attention. Table 3: Nation-wide distribution of rare, endangered and endemic tree species in Kenya.

MANAGEMENT OF FGR.
In situ conservation activities Protected areas Gazetted forest area comprises 1.7 million ha of which 1.22 million ha are closed canopy forest. Included in the 1.22 million ha are 0.16 million ha of plantations consisting primarily of exotic.
species, established mainly in the high potential areas of the country. Most of the gazetted and closed forests outside the gazetted area (0.18 million ha) also occur in the wet zones of Kenya. Figure 4 shows the distribution in Kenya of the main closed forests. In contrast, the highest population, density and diversity of Kenya's wild fauna is found in the dry zones of the country and about 90 % of the over 50 gazetted national parks, sanctuaries and game reserves are located in the arid and semi-arid areas (ASALs) (Fig.5). To date, Kenya has 26 national parks and 30 national game reserves (including one game sanctuary); thus 8% of Kenya's land is under some form of protection (Fig 4, 5). In addition, there are several private game sanctuaries, primarily set aside for the protection of the endangered Black Rhinoceros Diceros bicornis among other animals. Table 6 shows the major National Parks and game reserves. Table 6: Protected national Parks and Reserves Containing Significant forest areas.

Sacred forests The sacred forests are traditional forests and woodlands respected by local tribes. In Kenya the sacred forests are more common in the coast and are referred to as the "Kaya" forests. These forests are set aside by nine coastal tribes (miji kenda) for performing rituals according to their traditional and customary laws. In addition they are the source of traditional food plants and medicines. There are some 23 such kayas mainly in Kilifi and Kwale districts in the coast. The total area of major "kaya" sacred forests distributed along the coast is about 21,480 ha. Areas of some smaller kayas have not been established. The distribution of the major kayas is shown in figure.
The Coast sacred forests (kayas) are remains of the northern most elements of the ZanzibarInhambane phyto-geographical region, which stretches along the East African coast from northern Mozambique to southern Somalia. (White,1983). There is substantial body of botanical and zoological evidence to indicate that it was part of a more extensive coast forest system. The climate of this type of vegetation is semi-humid to semi arid. The greatest role of the Kayas is the conservation of the most threatened species that includes: Afzelia quanzensis, Brachystegia spiciformis, Brachylaena huillensis, Julberardia and Manilkara species, all of which have been over-exploited. Milicia excelsa and Sterculia appendiculata have already been eliminated from the forest reserves around through commercial logging. Traditional agro-forestry parklands systems A number of indigenous tree species are left behind after clearing vegetation for purposes of cultivation. Such trees are left by farmers over a large area of the northern Kenya and are valued as component species in the dryland farming system. The main parkland systems are scattered over the 80% of the country's arid and semi-arid lands. The few main tree species left on farms are Faidherbia albida, Erythrina abyssinica, Balanites aegyptiaca, Adansonia digitata, Acacia tortilis, Acacia nilotica, Terminalia brownii, Melia volkensii, Phoenix reclinata, among others. Farming systems along the tradational parklands in dry areas is by fallowing where land is left for a couple of years to rejuvenate its fertility levels for improved productivity of cultivated crops, mostly the cereals.
Ex situ conservation activities Seed banks and gene banks The Kenya Tree Seed Centre undertakes national tree seed collection, distribution and sale, both nationally and internationally (ICRAF, 1997). The Centre collects seed from identified sources, which covers both the dry and wet areas of the country. The centre also
