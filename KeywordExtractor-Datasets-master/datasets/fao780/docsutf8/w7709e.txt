<title>Asia-Pacific Forestry Sector Outlook Study: Forest Resources and Roundwood Supply in the Asia Pacific Countries: Situation and Outlook to the Year 2010</title>
<section>1</section>
INFORMATION NOTE ON ASIA-PACIFIC FORESTRY SECTOR OUTLOOK STUDY
At its sixteenth session held in Yangon, Myanmar, in January 1996, the Asia-Pacific Forestry Commission, which has membership open to all governments in the Asia-Pacific region, decided to carry out an outlook study for forestry with horizon year 2010. The study is being coordinated by FAO through its regional office in Bangkok and its Headquarters in Rome, but is being implemented in close partnership with governments, many of which have nominated national focal points.
The scope of the study is to look at the main external and sectoral developments in policies, programmes and institutions that will affect the forestry sector and to assess from this the likely direction of its evolution and to present its likely situation in 2010. The study involves assessment of current status but also of trends from the past and the main forces which are shaping those trends and then builds on this to explore future prospects.
Working papers have been contributed or commissioned on a wide range of topics. They fall under the following categories: country profiles, selected in-depth country or sub-regional studies and thematic studies. Working papers are prepared by individual authors or groups of authors on their own professional responsibility; therefore, the opinions expressed in them do not necessarily reflect the views of their employers, the governments of the Asia-Pacific Forestry Commission or of the Food and Agriculture Organization. In preparing the substantive report to be presented at the next session of the Asia-Pacific Forestry Commission early in 1998, material from these working papers will be an important element but will be blended and interpreted alongside a lot of other material.
Working papers are being produced and issued as they arrive. Some effort at uniformity of presentation is being attempted but the contents are only minimally edited for style or clarity. FAO welcomes from readers any information which they feel would be useful to the study on the subject of any of the working papers or on any other subject that has importance for the Asia-Pacific forestry sector.

1. INTRODUCTION
The main objectives of the working paper are:
· to present the current situation and the possible evolution of the forest resources in the Asia Pacific region.
· to propose an outlook of the roundwood supply in the Asia Pacific region to the year 2010.
To achieve these objectives, the study focused on the assessment of the current situation, trends and likely developments of the forest resources. Forest areas, growing stocks, increments and fellings have been reviewed on a country basis. Key driving forces of forestry sector development such as policy changes have been assessed to develop a likely quantitative forest scenario for the year 2010.
Roundwood supply has been analysed from two points of view: - roundwood production potential (increment) as the total estimated capacity to produce roundwood; and roundwood felling (removal) as the total roundwood harvested. Considering the impact of changes in the agricultural frontier and the population growth, the working paper has attempted to assess the potential productive capacity and fellings for both fuelwood and industrial wood uses.
The focus on wood production given in the working paper does not imply lower importance to other forest products or functions. These other functions are dealt with by other papers under the Asia Pacific forestry sector outlook study.

2. METHODOLOGY
2.1 The approach
2.2 The structure of the study
2.3 The model
2.4 The Projection
2.1 The approach
The approach of the study has been developed through three main steps:
· standardisation of the forest resources information in such a way that comparisons of areas and roundwood supply between countries and sub-regions are possible;
· derivation of the present situation of forest resources and roundwood supply in the different countries forming the region;
· development of a realistic scenario which describes the likely size, state and composition of the Asia Pacific forestry resource and of supply by 2010.
The country forest resources situation has been derived from the most reliable and up-to-date information on the state of forests and forestry available at FAO Headquarters. To provide "the most probable" situation by the year 2010, a model has been developed which works on a spreadsheet (Excel). The design of the model has been kept user friendly and simple. Formulas - standardised for all countries - are linear and mainly based on common sense; it is felt that in the absence of solid information, use of complex models might suggest greater knowledge than currently exists. The scenario mechanism is a tool to show signals based on possible forecasts for forest resources and wood supply under various assumptions. Under the study assumptions, users may modify any given parameters and build up their own image of the expected future situation; in this way, the implications of possible interventions or policies can be tested before decisions are taken.
It should be stressed that the aim has been to derive orders of magnitude. Greater precision would require more accurate information than many of the countries in the region are able to provide at present.
2.2 The structure of the study
For the purpose of the study, the Asia-Pacific region will extend from Pakistan in the west to the International Date Line in the east; from Mongolia, China and Japan in the north, to include the Pacific Islands until Australia and New Zealand inclusive in the south. It will not include the Russian Far East or any of the Americas.
For the study, a total of 24 countries (or group of islands) have been analysed and the Asia Pacific region has been sub-divided into the following five geographic sub-regions:
· North Asia: China, Japan, Korea (Rep.), Korea (Dem.), Mongolia;
· Oceania-Pacific: Papua New Guinea, Melanesia, Polynesia, New Zealand, Australia;
· Insular Asia: Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines;
· Continental South-East Asia: Myanmar, Laos, Cambodia, Thailand, Vietnam;
· South Asia: Pakistan, Nepal, Bhutan, India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh.
Sub-regions and countries are classified in decreasing order of forest and wooded land areas as in 1990. Each country has been studied individually; summation of country data was used to obtain the sub-regional and regional estimates of the forest resources status and the roundwood supply (potential and fellings). Islands of the Pacific have been grouped into Melanesia and Polynesia Islands.
2.3 The model
2.3.1 Assumptions
2.3.2 The parameters
To present the situation of the forest resources and roundwood supply in each country and to work out a possible scenario showing the likely evolution up to the year 2010, a model has been developed. The model runs by 5 year periods with a set of formulas and parameters for which definitions are detailed in Section 3.
Some prerequisite assumptions have been made and are related to wood production, felling and growth. Assumptions and parameters needed to establish the forest resources status and to develop the base scenario are given below.
2.3.1 Assumptions
Wood production
The study considers that wood production originates from three main sources:
· production forests: comprise all natural exploitable forests and plantation forests.
· other forests and wooded lands: low productive, poor, open forests or forests partially or totally protected. These forests contribute to the wood supply of the local population (but this contribution is often unrecorded). Wood destruction due to fires and other natural disasters is not considered in the study.
· non forested lands: are all but forested areas. Commercial tree crops (mainly rubber and coconut) in some countries and arable lands produce significant amounts of wood. Rangelands, barren and rocky lands, deserts are considered as wood un-productive areas.
Wood fellings
The study considers that:
· Fellings of industrial roundwood: originate only from the production forests and that the industrial roundwood supply is commercialised in the formal sector.
· Fuelwood and other local timber fellings are directly linked to the estimated wood consumption of the population.
Wood Growth
Considering the short period of the outlook (20 years), wood stock estimates per hectare and annual increment parameters are kept unchanged during the whole scenario period (1990-2010). Wood production changes are linked mainly with forest area changes.
2.3.2 The parameters
The forest resources parameters
The data base line of the forest resources situation is generally 1990. However, data are called parameters as many are standardised or estimated. The parameters needed to feed the model for each country are as follow:
· The area (in ha):
* total country area;
* total forest and wooded land;
* natural exploitable forests
* plantation forests (man-made forests);
* forest conservation area;
* low productive/open forests
* arable lands;
* commercial tree crops (rubber, coconuts);
* other/range/barren lands.
· The commercial growing stock (in m^3/ha) related to:
* natural exploitable forests;
* plantation forests (man-made forests).
· The mean annual increment (in m^3/year/ha) related to:
* natural exploitable forests;
* plantation forests (man-made forests);
* low productive and open forests;
* commercial tree crops (rubber, coconuts);
* trees growing on arable lands.
· Fellings (in m^3/year) expressed as:
* Industrial roundwood removals (m^3/year);
* Fuelwood fellings (m^3/inh/year).
The parameters influencing projected situation
The future evolution of forest resources and wood supply will depend upon the changes in the following main parameters:
· the deforestation factor - (% of loss of natural exploitable forests and other forests and wooded lands area per year);
· the plantation forests programme (thousands ha per year);
· the removals of industrial roundwood - (thousands m^3/year).
· the conservation areas (totally protected);
· the commercial tree crop;
· the range conversion factor is the estimated percentage of the deforested lands turned into range lands;
· the increase of other/range/barren lands in relation to lands made available from deforestation.
The definitions of these parameters are given in section 3.
2.4 The Projection
2.4.1 Information sources
2.4.2 Country profiles and sub-regional analysis
Only one projection, considered a likely trajectory, has been developed which provides in 5-year periods up to the year 2010 a possible outlook on the following:
· the forested areas in terms of productive and non productive zones being natural or planted forests;
· the commercial growing stock from natural and planted forests;
· the annual roundwood felling broken down into industrial roundwood and fuelwood;
· the annual wood production potential (increment) of roundwood broken down by sources (production forests, other forests, non forested lands).
2.4.1 Information sources
Information related to country forest resources has been collected at FAO headquarters principally from published and raw information under the Forest Resources Assessment (FRA) programme. The first draft of the study containing the FAO information and the consequent scenario was sent to the countries through the outlook study focal points for comments and validation. Relevant notes and remarks have therefore been integrated. The revised projection for forest resources and roundwood supply are considered by the author to be the most likely. This procedure replaces the possibility of first obtaining first hand figures from the countries themselves through questionnaires.
The information related to national forest areas is mainly based on the Forest Resources Assessment 1990 - FAO Forestry paper 112, 124, 127. Arable land areas are from FAO Production Yearbook 1994. Information related to exploitable natural forest and plantation forests areas are from country sources collected at FAO and the same source is used for the FAO - GFSS (Global Fibre Supply Study); however, some figures provided were adapted in accordance with the specific study definitions. Figures related to wood growth - growing stock and increment - do not often exist at national level and are extrapolated from similar situations.
Figures related to industrial wood removals are taken from country documents or recent reliable studies. Fuelwood production figures are from the FAO Yearbook of Forest Products and from the Review of Wood Energy Data in member countries of the Regional Wood Energy Development Project (RWEDP) (March 1997).
Table I.2 provides the summary of the values given to each parameter for each country.
2.4.2 Country profiles and sub-regional analysis
For each country, a forest resources profile has been developed. Each profile contains the following analysis: (a) the country's forest situation: describes the state of the forest (tropical or temperate), forest distribution, main problems, management level with logging intensity, plantation forests programme, rural forestry, conservation forest activity; (b) Forestry sector development: gives a short analysis of the present forest policy, strategy and legal framework related to forest development; and (c) "projected development": explains the reasoning and level of the parameters used to build up the base scenario. Some comments on the results are provided.
The countries are grouped as outlined earlier and country base scenarios are aggregated into sub-regional scenarios. A short analysis accompanies each respective sub-regional scenario. This analysis discusses three points: (1) the overall sub-regional forest resources status; (2) the sub-regional sectoral perspectives; and (3) wood production potential and fellings in the sub-region. Countries composing the sub-regions are compared from the point of view of forest resources areas, annual roundwood fellings and increment.
The 24 country profiles and their projections and the 5 sub-regional analyses are given in Part II.

3. DEFINITION OF THE PARAMETERS AND FORMULAS USED IN THE WOOD SUPPLY PROJECTION
3.1 Forest resources parameters
3.2 Projection parameters
3.3 The supply projection
3.1 Forest resources parameters
The proposed definitions are consistent with the definition used in the FAO Global Fibre Supply Study (GFSS). Country forest resources figures are those of 1990. Production parameters are put all together in Table 8.
The areas (in ha):
· Total country land: total country land area excluding inland water. Figures are provided from FRA - 90 (Global synthesis - FAO Forestry Paper No. 124) and the FAO Yearbook of Forest Products.
· Forest and other wooded lands (FOWL): include all types of forested areas being forests or wooded lands (see definition below). Figures are standardized and taken from FRA-90 (Global synthesis - no 124) and considered as a point of reference for all countries. FOWL are formed of:
· Forests: are ecological systems with a minimum crown coverage of land surface (here assumed as 10%) ^1 and generally associated with wild flora, fauna and natural soil conditions. It is worthwhile pointing out that the definition used in the study has a minimum vegetation cover requirement and is often quite different from a legal definition of forest (such as in a Forest Act or Ordinance).
^1 FAO - Forest Resources Assessment - guidelines for Assessment 1990.
· Wooded lands: include forest fallow and shrubs. Forest fallow refers to all complexes of woody vegetation deriving from the clearing of natural forest for shifting cultivation. Forest fallow is an intermediate class between forest and non forest land uses. Shrubs refer to vegetation types where the dominant woody elements are shrubs with more than 50 cm and less than 5 meters height on maturity.
· Natural exploitable forests: refer to natural or semi-natural forests composed of tree species known to be indigenous to the area. It includes bamboo forests. Natural exploitable forest (or commercial forests) means productive and economically accessible forests. It is the area available for timber wood supply. Forest areas having economic restrictions (environmental, health, access constraints) or legally protected (and having significant impact on wood supply) are not included. Figures are often based on information provided by Master plans, articles or documents from national forestry administrations or ministries and are in accordance with GFSS data.
· Plantation forests (or man-made forests): are forests established by afforestation or reforestation. Plantation forests include all types of forest tree plantations whether industrial, communal or individual covering at least an area of about half hectare. Trees on road side, canal banks and homesteads are not included; also rubber, coconut and oil-palm are excluded.
· Low productive/open forest areas: are all forests being considered as poorly stocked or partially exploited. This category of forests includes open forests, totally or partially protected forests and forested conservation areas. Protected forests of watersheds are included. That area is calculated and is the result of the difference between the total forest and wooded land and the natural exploitable forests plus plantation forests.
· Conservation areas: consist of national parks, reserves and protected natural areas which fall under IUCN categories. Figures are provided by the World Conservation Monitoring Centre (WCMC) ^2. As it is presently not yet possible to separate forest areas from barren and other lands inside conservation areas, conservation figures are given for information. Conservation areas are included in the low productive/open forests areas and have no immediate implication on total forest area calculation.
^2 See document APFSOS/WP/04 prepared by WCMC for this outlook study.
· Arable lands: refers to arable land under temporary crops, homestead gardens (agro and urban forestry), and land temporarily fallow or lying idle (recent slash and burned areas). Range lands are not included in arable lands as it is assumed that range lands provide no or very limited wood supply. Arable lands may include trees on roads side and canal banks.
· Commercial tree crop lands: refers to land cultivated with tree crops that occupy the land for long periods. Commercial crop area is mainly related to rubber and coconut plantations that have an significant impact on wood production in some countries.
· Other/range/barren lands: are areas that do not contribute to wood supply. That means barren lands such as rocky lands and deserts. Range lands are included. Area figure is obtained by deducting forest and arable lands from the total land area.
Commercial Growing Stock (CGS)
The Commercial Growing Stock (CGS) means the volume that may actually be cut and removed from the natural exploitable forests and plantations forests. This volume of wood may include wood for industrial purposes (e.g. sawlogs, veneer logs, etc.) and for local domestic use (poles for construction). Use of wood for fuelwood is not included in this category.
· CGS natural forest (in m^3/ha): is the estimated over bark volume of all actually commercialised trees (over 10 cm diameter at breast height) living on one hectare in the natural exploitable forests. In tropical forests, only a small part of the total growing stock can be effectively used for commercial purposes. Figures on commercial growing stock in natural exploitable forests are often estimated or extrapolated from similar situations.
· CGS plantations (in m^3/ha): is the estimated over bark volume of all trees (over 10 cm at breast height) growing on one hectare of tree plantation. As almost no average figures exist (except for some countries, but to what extent are they valid?), the commercial growing stock is difficult to appraise as plantations are a mix of mature and young (in majority) stands with the age distribution not known.
Mean Annual Increment (MAI)
The MAI (Mean Annual Increment) is the volume of wood growing on one hectare of forest during one year (m^3/ha/year) on average since the forest has been established. For a tree plantation, the MAI is the present total growing stock volume of one hectare divided by the total age. The total age of the natural forest is not known. In this study, MAI is related to the CGS.
· MAI natural exploitable forests (m^3/ha/year): is the mean annual increment (per ha) of the commercial species growing stock in natural and semi-natural forests. Generally no precise figures are available, only guesstimates exist. Recent studies show that MAI of natural exploitable forest is very low and sometimes negative due to natural death. Figures used fall between 0 to 2 m^3/ha/year.
· MAI plantations (m^3/ha/year): is the mean annual increment (per ha) of forest plantations. Good estimates exist in various situations. Plantations may include fast growing trees as well as low growing trees. Used figures are in the range 2-18 m^3/ha/year depending on species, age and reported growth.
· MAI other forests (m^3/ha/year): is the mean annual increment (per ha) of wood stock growing in all forests areas which are not classified as production forests such as low productive, protected and open forests. Figures are guesstimates. However, it is certain that large areas of low productive/open forests produce significant amounts of fuelwood and other products. A coefficient ranging from 0 to 1.5 m^3/ha/year is used at least to show that these areas have some production potential which has to be taken into account.
· MAI commercial crop plantation (m^3/ha/year): is the mean annual increment (per ha) of wood produced mainly from rubber and coconuts plantations. Good estimates exist in some countries. These estimates have been extrapolated and proposed figures range from 0 to 3.5 m^3/ha/year.
· MAI arable lands (m^3/ha/year): is the mean annual increment (per ha) of wood stock produced from agricultural lands including homestead production. Homestead production has been studied in various situations although national average figures are not precise. Average production is proposed between 1 and 2 m^3/ha/year.
Fellings
Felling is the volume felled during a given period whether or not removed from forest or other felling sites; that includes silvicultural and pre-commercial thinnings and cleaning left in the forest. Normally volume is over bark. Removal is only what is exported from the forest and corresponds to fellings less harvesting residues.
· Industrial roundwood (m^3/year): include all industrial wood in the rough (logs, sawlogs and veneerlogs, pulpwood and chips, poles, piling, pitprops, match blocks, etc...) but no fuelwood. Official figures are generally available.
· Waste and residues (%): represents the felling residuals which are left in the forest after felling and not salvaged. This is a coefficient (%) attached to the industrial roundwood supply and should give the quantity of wood wasted during the harvesting operations. This coefficient varies according to the quality of forest logging and management methods. The coefficient may vary from 10 to 50%.
· Fuel and other wood consumption (m^3/inh/year): is the wood in the rough to be used as fuel for cooking, heating and energy production. Other wood includes a certain amount of local timber (poles, piling and posts) which is not recorded in the formal sector but is used by farmers and rural communities. Figures are based on the population's consumption estimate (per inhabitant).
Population
· Population (inh): the total inhabitants living in the country in 1990. Estimations are from the UN document - "World Population prospects: the 1994 revision". The medium variant has been used.
· Population increase (% per year): is the annual increment (in percentage) of the country population. Estimates and forecasts up to the year 2010 are taken from FRA - 90 or from UN - "World Population prospects: the 1994 revision" in the median variant tables.
3.2 Projection parameters
The likely development of forest resources and wood supply by 2010 is shown by five year period. It is based on the following parameters or assumptions:
· deforestation factor (%): is the annual deforestation percentage on FOWL provided by FRA 90 and related to the country. It applies to natural exploitable forests and to low productive/open forests and is constant for the whole period. The deforestation factor varies from 0 to 2.5% per year. Assumption is made that deforested lands are turned into arable land (keeping some potential for wood production) and rangelands (see range conversion factor).
· Plantation forests programme (ha per year): is a prevision for the annual planting programme for man-made forests. Estimates are based on the country planning objectives and the country capacity to realise the programme. The prevision is constant for the whole period except for some specific cases where prevision is done by five year period.
· removals - industrial roundwood (in m^3/year): is an annual estimate of the domestic industrial roundwood supply. Figures are generally from country official sources. A constant waste and residues coefficient is applied to get fellings estimates.
· conservation area (in ha): shows the possible increase of the total protected areas.
· commercial tree crops (in ha): gives the possible evolution of the area under rubber, coconut crops which could produce wood as raw material.
· Range lands conversion factor (%) is the estimated percentage of deforested lands converted into cultivated lands. Deforested lands are not always turned into arable and cultivated lands but part of them are turned into rang and barren lands. Assumption is made that range lands do not produce significant amount of wood.
· other/range/barren lands area (in ha): shows the increase of area of the non wood producing land area under the assumed percentage of range conversion factor.
3.3 The supply projection
Formulas
The column 1990 uses the forest resources parameters when applicable. For each five year period, the following formulas have been applied:
Production forests
Area total = natural exploitable forests + plantation forests
· Natural exploitable forests = exploit. for. - 5 years x (exploit. for. x deforestation factor).
· Tree plantations = tree plantations + 5 years x annual tree planting programme.
Commercial Growing stock (CGS)
a) for 1990 = baseline information = CGS nat. exploit. forest + CGS plantation forests.
b) For 1991 - to date = CGS nat. exploit. forests + CGS plantation forests + 5 years x (SI total - fellings total) of the preceding period.
· Nat. exploit. forests = nat. exploit. forest area x CGS/ha for nat. exploit. forest.
· Plantation forests
a) for 1990 = baseline information = plantation forests area x CGS/ha plantation forest
b) for 1991 - to date = CGS of the former period + 5 years stock increase (plantation forest area x MAI/ha/year).
Annual wood Stock Increment (SI), {Total SI = SI natural forest + SI plantations}.
· SI - Natural exploitable forest = nat. exploit. forest area x MAI natural exploitable forest.
· SI - Plantations = plantation forests areas x MAI plantation forests.
Fellings industrial roundwood, total = ind. roundwood removals + waste and residues.
· Industrial roundwood removals = see projection parameters.
· Waste and residues = industrial roundwood removals x percentage of waste and residues.
Other forests and wooded lands
Conservation areas = see scenario parameters
Low productive/open forests = low prod./open forests area - 5 years x (low prod./open for. x deforestation factor).
Wood stock increment (SI), total = low productive/open forests area x MAI (other forests).
Non forest lands
Commercial tree crop lands = see scenario parameter.
Arable lands = total country land - total forest and wooded lands - other/range/barren lands - commercial tree crops lands.
Wood stock increment (SI), total = commercial tree crops lands area x MAI (commercial tree crops) + arable lands area x MAI (arable lands).
Fellings fuelwood, total = fuelwood consumption per inhabitant x country population + 5 years x (total fuelwood consumption x percentage annual population increase).
Results
- Wood Stock Increment (SI), all sources: is the Total Annual Increment of wood produced from all productive areas: production forests, other forests and wooded lands and non forest lands.
= SI production forests + SI other forests and wooded lands + SI non forests lands.
- Felling, all sources: is the total volume of all trees that are felled either for industrial or fuelwood purposes.
= industrial roundwood fellings + fuelwood fellings.
- Total forest and wooded lands: is the evolution of the total forested area taking into account deforestation effects and plantations programmes.
= total production forests area + low productive/open forests.
- Percentage of total land: gives the possible evolution of the proportion of land covered with forests and wooded lands.
= total forests and wooded lands area/total land area x 100.

4. RESULTS: FOREST RESOURCES SITUATION AND ROUNDWOOD SUPPLY IN ASIA PACIFIC REGION
4.1 Forests and wooded lands in land use
4.2 Roundwood production potential
4.3 Roundwood fellings
4.4 Comparison between wood production potential and fellings: Industrial roundwood, fuelwood and total roundwood supply (SI = wood stock increment)
Table 1 provides the overall regional picture of forest resources and roundwood supply from 1990 up to 2010. Forest resources areas and roundwood supply are broken down by forest land use category: - production forests including natural exploitable forests and plantation forests; - other forests and wooded lands including low productive and open forests; - non forest lands including commercial tree crops and arable lands.
The 1995 status and the likely development up to 2010 are analysed below regarding the following aspects: (a) the forests and wooded lands in land use; (b) roundwood production potential (and growing stock); (c) roundwood fellings; and (d) comparison between roundwood production potential and roundwood (industrial, fuel and total) fellings.
4.1 Forests and wooded lands in land use
4.1.1 1995 status
4.1.2 Projected 2010 situation
4.1.1 1995 status
About 28 % of the total land area of the whole Asia Pacific region is covered with forests and wooded lands of which 31% are natural exploitable forests, 6% plantation forests and 61% are classified as low productive and open forests (Figure 1; Table 1).
The distribution by sub-regions of the forests and wooded lands is as followed: 10% in South Asia, 14% in Continental S.E., 21% in Insular Asia, 25% in Oceania and Pacific, and 28% in North Asia. South-Asia and Continental South-East Asia are relatively poor in terms of forest cover.
Regarding the exploitable forests, the distribution is somewhat different: 11% in South Asia, 15% in Continental S.E., 32% in Insular Asia, only 10% in Oceania-Pacific, and 31% in North Asia. Insular Asia is the most wealthy sub-region with natural exploitable forests.
Non forest lands (arable and commercial crops) contribute significantly to roundwood supply. About 15% of the total land area of the AP region are arable lands and tree commercial crop lands; these are equivalent to about 50% of the forests and wooded lands area. Trees on arable lands play a particularly important role in sub-regions where forested areas are relatively limited such as in South Asia.

4.1.2 Projected 2010 situation
As a continuation of present trends, the total forests and wooded lands a
