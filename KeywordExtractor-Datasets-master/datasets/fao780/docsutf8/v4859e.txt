Introduction
Introduction
1. The Seventh Session of the Working Party on Women and the Agricultural Family in Rural Development was held in Athens, Greece from 18 to 21 October 1994 at the kind invitation of the Government of the Hellenic Republic.
2. The Session was attended by delegations from twelve countries of the European Region and Observers from intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations. The list of participants and officers of the Session is attached in Annex I.
Opening of the Session
3. The Opening Ceremony was held in conjunction with the Joint Meeting of the Eightieth Session of the FAO/ECA Executive Committee and of the Bureau of the UN/ECE Committee on Agriculture.
4. The FAO Regional Representative for Europe, Mr. M. Zjalic, welcomed the participants on behalf of the Director-General of FAO and conveyed his best wishes for the success of both meetings. He thanked the Host Government for its invitation, for the excellent facilities provided and its strong and continuous support to FAO. He stated that the Seventh Session of the Working Party will review activities and programmes aimed at improving the social and economic position of women in rural areas and their more active, responsible and creative role in rural development. It will at the same time, produce proposal, ideas, recommendations and requests through which FAO can assist in the promotion of the social well being as well as the rights and equality of rural women.
5. The Minister for Agriculture, H.E. George Moraitis, on behalf of his Government, warmly welcomed the participants to the Session. He referred to the significant changes made in the agricultural structure and in particular to the new opportunities accruing from these changes and their implications for rural women. He stressed the important role of the family in development, noting that the family is the cornerstone of society. As 1994 is proclaimed the International Year of the Family, it is necessary to create an awareness of the key role of the family and its contribution to society. He also stated that sound family policy should be the base for general equality and family welfare. The full text of the Minister's statement is provided in Annex II.
6. The Chairperson of the Working Party, Dr. G. Pichler, in her opening address welcomed the participants to the Seventh Session. She expressed her gratitude to the Greek Government for their kind invitation and to the Regional Representative for Europe for the constant support of REUR to the activities of the Working Party.
7. She underlined the importance of holding the two meetings at the same time thus affording an opportunity for an exchange of ideas and information.
8. She referred to the significant role of rural women in coping with the difficulties pertaining to rural areas and to society and outlined the contribution of rural women to family and enterprise development and their potential as managers and entrepreneurs. She stressed the importance of the development of pluriactivity in order to secure the income of rural people and how this Session could contribute to this development.
9. The Chairman of the ECA Executive Committee, Prof. S. Kyritsis thanked the Minister for his interesting statement and welcomed the delegates and the guests to the Opening Ceremony.
Summary of Recommendations from the Session
10. The main recommendations from the Seventh Session were:
- The Working Party on Women should continue to initiate activities to empower rural women to become active in the socio-economic development of the country and in activities to stimulate rural development. Specific attention should be given to:
(1) development of effective mechanisms (policies and training) for addressing critical issues concerning rural women;
(2) development of effective mechanisms (market and non-market) to cope with high level of unemployment in rural areas;
(3) development of effective mechanisms (training and technical) to support community leaders and facilitators of change in rural areas;
(4) development of special assistance to rural women in Eastern European, countries by facilitating partnership and networks with Western European countries, and by providing training programmes, workshops and dissemination of relevant information.
- That the next session of the Working Party focuses either on environment or on mechanisms to mobilize rural youth.
- That the theme of the Eighth International Summer School should be decided by the Board.
- That a workshop on the findings from the project" Analysis of the Socio-Economic Status of Rural Women in Central and Eastern Europe" should be organized.
- That the European Community and national governments establish effective policies to address the urgent needs of rural women.
- That FAO Secretariat should obtain verification of the results of the project "Analysis of the Socio-Economic Status of Rural Women in Central and Eastern European Countries" from the respective governments.
- That the governments of Eastern Europe transform the recommendations of the 7th Session which emerged from the Analysis of the Socio-Economic Status of Rural Women in Central and Eastern European Countries into national plans of action to address the problems identified and priority needs of rural women.
- That the governments of Eastern European countries develop effective strategies to change the behaviour and attitude of rural women by combining a bottom up with top down approach to rural development.
- That the FAO Secretariat should start the administrative procedures to change the title of the Working Party into "Working Party on Women and the Family in Rural Development".

Consultative Meeting on Emerging Issues Concerning the Status of Rural Women in Europe
16. The Rural Development Officer from REUR, Dr. Tea Petrin, reported on the above-mentioned Consultative Meeting, which was held in Herrsching, Germany, on 7 September 1994. Twenty-three Representatives from sixteen European countries attended the Meeting.
17. The objective of the Meeting was to identify emerging issues concerning the status of rural women in the European region and suggest recommendations on required mechanisms and policies to address these issues.
18. The result of the Meeting was the Statement on Emerging Issues Concerning Rural Women in the European Region in relation to political, economic and social issues. The critical areas of concerns and recommendations on the mechanisms and/or policies identified at the Meeting and expressed in the Statement will be presented at the UN/ECE High-Level Regional Preparatory Meeting for the Fourth World Conference on Women in Vienna, 17-21 October 1994 by Ms. Sirpa Polo of the Finnish Crafts and Arts Organization, Helsinki, Finland, appointed Representative of the Group.
19. The findings of the Consultative Meeting are included in the FAO/REUR Report of Activities in support of rural women in Europe in preparation for the Fourth World Conference on Women. The Report of Activities will be distributed at the UN/ECE High-Level Regional Preparatory Meeting. The draft Resolution on Rural Women in Development was prepared on the basis of the findings of the Consultative Meeting and will be presented at the UN/ECE High-Level Meeting in Vienna.
International Year of the Family
20. Mrs. M.J. Mermillod, Senior Home Economics Officer, Women in Agricultural Production and Rural Development Service (ESHW, FAO) introduced the objectives of the International Year of the Family proclaimed by the UN General Assembly for the year 1994. FAO has been associated with the various events and in particular with the inter-agencies meetings - the regional preparatory meetings and the World Non-Governmental Organizations Forum held in Malta in December 1993. Reference was made to the "Declaration of Valletta" adopted at the preparatory meeting for Europe and North America and to the "Statement" adopted by the International NGOs.
21. The importance of families in sustainable development was stressed but the process of development itself tends to change the nature of the family. Constraints have increased in many countries particularly where programmes of structural adjustment have been introduced and in the countries with economies in transition.
22. The prospects for rural families should be considered within the context of changes in the role of agriculture in the specific European countries. Major changes are resulting from the privatization in Eastern and Central Europe and concomitant expansion of markets which require increasing competencies and entrepreneurial capacity of agricultural producers.
23. The traditional gender-based division of productive and reproductive functions in the family does not reflect the current realities. A partnership between men and women on the basis of equal rights and responsibilities is the challenge for the modern family. Basic to this challenge is gender equality in the household, equal sharing of family responsibilities between men and women as well as participation of women in employment.
24. Family issues are thus intimately connected with those concerning gender equality and the situation of women. The IYF should be seen as the beginning of a long term process of addressing social and economic issues from the family supportive perspective.
25. The Report on support activities for the International Year of the Family was presented by Ms. L. Rossini van Hissenhoven of the International Council of Women (ICW). She stated that ICW has been seriously involved in the International Year of the Family. In October 1994 (Amsterdam), ICW organized jointly with the Free University of Amsterdam, a Seminar on "The Violence in the Family".
26. The Standing Committees of ICW work very closely in formulating Resolutions and Plans of Action. For instance in Paris, June 1994 the Standing Committee on "Child and the Family" worked on:
· Protection and development of children.
· Children living in particularly difficult conditions: children's weddings, children's works, children's abuse, children in the streets.
· International Year of the Family: education to the family life, share of the responsibilities between men and women.
· New reproduction technologies: ethics questions related to new technologies, commercial substitution of maternity, etc.
· The right of keeping children.
27. The Social Welfare Committee has adopted the Plan of Action 1994-1997 by promotion of:
· Sharing the responsibilities concerning the family.
· Working for better understanding of the real causes of the violence in the domestic family and the sexual harassment and studying the ways to alleviate those problems.
· Improving the economic conditions of the women (is she: single, married, old, young) in relation to her role in society.
· Working on programmes in favour of people not normally provided for in society
(unsheltered, free prisoners, those prostituted of necessity, and the mentally handicapped).
· Promoting actions from Governments or Authorities in defence of Women and
Children (as well as migrant people) concerning employment.
28. These plans of Action as well as these of the others Standing Committees are circulated among the 80 National Councils affiliated all over the world.
Topics
TOPIC 1
THE FAMILY IN SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
29. One paper was presented on the topic "The Family in Sustainable Development in Rural Areas" by Prof. Ulrich Nitsch (Sweden). The paper was based on a recent sociological survey which was conducted at the Swedish University of Agricultural Science. Results indicated that a considerable portion of the farming families see their household incomes decreasing and feel insecure about their possibilities to stay on the farm in the future.
30. It indicated that even if the economic conditions in farming are improved the social and cultural conditions will continue to deteriorate unless actions are taken. Today farmers spend most of their working time alone and they have increasing difficulties in finding a spouse to join the farmwork. A young professional woman cannot be expected to leave her work and social network in an urban area to move to the isolation and strange rural culture on a depopulated country-side.
31. The idea of the family farm with one person working full-time at the farm does not seem to have a future in Sweden. Part-time farming, where both spouses meet work-mates and earn additional income outside the farm, seems to be the most feasible solution. To remain sustainable it requires the support of local work opportunities and social services. The participation of the farmers and other rural people in this development process is a necessary precondition. The survival of rural communities depends on the establishment of a diversified rural economy in control of the rural people.
32. During the discussion following the presentation, Mr. C. Huillet, the Representative of OECD, underlined that in discussing issues of sustainable development in rural areas attention should be particularly given to what we mean about rural development.
33. The concept of rural development should be seen as a whole. It encompasses all human' and material resources. No aspect of land use, level of economic development or sector is excluded; every opportunity to enhance the quality of life is to be seized; cultural and environmental assets are to be safeguarded while used to best advantage. Rural development is a territorial and multisectorial issue. In other word as it has been said by OECD Minister of Agriculture in 1992 and later, economic and social problems of rural areas had to be tackled as a whole. A policy addressing agriculture alone would no longer do. The central challenge for rural development is to foster an improved national balance of economic opportunities and social conditions, utilizing an appropriate mix of market and non-market mechanisms to improve national economic performance, while safeguarding and developing important aspects of the rural heritage.
^1 not only the farmers who, for example in Sweden, represent less than 3% of the total population
Group Workshops and Discussion on Topic 1
34. The topic was discussed in three group workshops from the priority family needs viewpoint in relation to:
a. families in general;
b. women in particular;
c. youth in particular.
Each group had to indicate the steps to provide for these needs.
35. The summary of the results from the three group workshops were:
PROBLEMS
(a) Families
- Lack of income possibilities
- Infrastructure (schools, shops, etc.)
- Disintegration of the family
- Child care
- Isolation
- Lack for homes for elderly and handicapped people
- Different needs (different generations)
- Lack of job opportunities
- Lack of common leisure time
- Social stigma of families (agricultural families with many children)
- The approach to rural issues is still too often restricted to agriculture
- Traditional gender role
- Lack of training
- Farmers unmarried
(b) Rural Women
- Getting a job according to the qualification
- Low status (social) of farm wives
- Economical dependence (for farm wives)
- Lack of leisure - free time for farm wives
- Traditional gender role
- Inter - generational conflict
- Infrastructure
- Social control (family, society, etc.)

36. In the Plenary Session the discussion highlighted the following points as being of importance for a future focus in development i.e. empowering people to:
· Build human capacity in rural areas
· Promote creativity and innovativeness at all levels
· Mobilize local people and resources
· Enable leadership
· Enable self initiative and self help
· Build opportunities for equality
· Delimit the boundaries and expand horizons
· Develop entrepreneurial culture
· Provide training which will influence desired change
· Change the unfavourable demographic situation
TOPIC 2
NUTRITION AS A FACTOR IN FAMILY WELL BEING
37. Prof. Antony Kafatos (Greece) submitted a paper on this topic, "Nutrition and Health as Contributing Factors for Improved Prosperity of the Greek Family", which discussed nutrition as a key factor for the health of the individual and society. He noted that the interdependence of mind and body of the ancient Greeks was an integral part of their lives. The rapid socio-economic changes occurring in Greece over the last thirty years brought about "Westernized" life-style with accompanying diary consumption habits and their apparent attitudes.
38. Unhealthy dietary habits, lack of physical activity, smoking and alcohol consumption are characterizing modern life -styles and health related attitudes. More precisely, high levels of cholesterol (TC), LDL-cholesterol and triglycerides, high LDL/HDL cholesterol and TC/HDL, low levels of HDL-cholesterol, lack of physical activity, high blood pressure, smoking, high consumption of saturated fats and obesity are strongly related to the development of chronic disease and especially coronary heart disease. Studies have shown that if risk factors for CHD exist at an early age, they persist into adulthood.
39. Inspite of the alarming facts presented, there is no national policy in nutrition. Only isolated, scattered and inadequately funded efforts towards prevention have been taking place the last decade. The only physical fitness programmes conducted on a national basis are those during primary and secondary education. Physical education, approximately two-three hours of instruction per week, is part of the curriculum of all primary and secondary schools. However, the particular educational programme focuses exclusively on physical fitness (gymnastics and sports), while no emphasis is given to the nutritional component.
40. In order to stem the tide of chronic disease risk factors, health education programmes have been initiated and expanded in Crete. Positive preliminary results have been seen already. The health of the individual serves the health of the family and the society as a whole. We all have a vested interest in improving family nutrition and helping to prevent chronic diseases. A healthy and happy home environment is the greatest legacy we can offer to our children and our future.
41. The second paper in this section - "Implementation of FAO International Conference on Nutrition" - was presented by Dr. Azizan Ghazali, Chief, Nutrition Programmes Service (ESN, FAO). The paper discussed the FAO approach to raising nutritional status and improving living standards of all population groups. From FAO Food Balance Sheets, it appears that in Europe calories available for consumption are high and still increasing. In many of these countries with food availability and variety, most dietary deficiency diseases have been virtually eliminated and are being replaced by lifestyle and diet related diseases due to imbalances in dietary intake. Despite this development, hunger and undernutrition still exist in some countries, especially those moving from centrally planned to market economies. The challenge for Europe as a whole is therefore to ensure the equitable distribution and consumption of the right quantity and quality of safe wholesome food to promote health
and prevent diet-related diseases. Action is needed to harmonize food and agricultural policies with health and individual nutritional needs.
42. By adopting the World Declaration and Plan of Action of Nutrition, the policy guidelines and action areas under the nine themes spelled out and developing Plans of Action for Nutrition within this framework, governments can meet the challenge. Many have started, and some with FAO collaboration, in addressing country specific areas of nutrition related concerns. For example, several projects are on-going to strengthen food safety and quality control system.
43. Women play a key role in the socio-economic development of rural areas and in many societies they are also the main producers of food. As women are the main providers of meals as well as care and nutrition information in the household they have a fundamental role in assuring improved nutritional status for all. Consequently we need to strengthen their role in the management of household resources for the achievement of household food security and improved nutrition. They need support to balance their reproductive, nurturing, educational and economic roles which are so important to the health and nutritional wellbeing of the household and of the entire community.
44. FAO stands ready to assist countries, particularly the food and agriculture sector, in developing ICN follow-up activities including strengthening the role of women in rural development.
45. Following the presentation, the Plenary discussion related to the merits and demerits of fast foods in the diet; the effects of undesirable combinations of foods in the diet. The importance of education/training as well as an awareness and balanced knowledge on good and proper eating habits was highlighted.
TOPIC 3
WOMEN AND YOUTH IN RURAL DEVELOPMENT
46. Two papers were presented on this topic. The first paper, "A Focus on Youth in Rural Development - Future Possibilities and Options" presented by Ms. Oddny Kjelsen, (Norway) outlined the situation in Norway and how an innovative programme addressed potential growth problems of unemployment and depopulation of rural areas.
47. In Norway the depopulation trend threatens the vialiability of rural communities as the population density in Norway is only 13 persons per Km2. The primary sector underpins the existence of many rural communities, so it is necessary to secure a high level of activity in agriculture. In addition new jobs will have to be created in order to substitute those which are being lost in the primary sector.
48. Allocations for rural development are growing every year, through establishment grants, financial support for young farmers and campaigns to enable girls to take over farms, but still more needs to be done.
49. A new trend in the 1990's show that young people aged 16-24 leave the rural areas. They go to urban centers to have an education, and they never return home. These facts have made the Norwegian Government concentrate on the question: How to develop an entrepreneurial spirit in young people in order to make use of local resources and create new jobs? Therefore schools must educate creators of jobs.
50. The scheme "Dynamic Local Schools" (DLS) was designed for this purpose. The scheme consists of three components:
- Pupil Enterprises (primary and secondary level);
- Tertiary level courses in "the world of work and entrepreneurship" for teachers and other key persons;
- The building of networks.
51. It is important that the pupils themselves establish and run the enterprise. The teacher gives guidance and advice. The pupils learn to assess local resources, evaluate demands in the market and create the right products and services. They are trained to be competent to create a job to ensure future employment.
52. The project DLS has been very well received and now there are local subprojects in all Norwegian Counties. It is felt that this approach is the right way towards the restructuring challenges of the future.
53. Discussions following the presentation on how this innovative system of Dynamic Local Schools is integrated into the classical school system and on the importance of avoiding a prescriptive approach in order to preserve the innovativeness of development. There was also further clarification on constraints and problems encountered in setting up the process.
54. Another programme from France which promotes entrepreneurship was outlined. This training programme provides for young people from 14 years to adult stage, and is recognised by the Ministry of Agriculture as an important development for rural areas.
55. The second paper "Women's Situation in the European Labour Market and the NOW Initiative" was presented by Prof. Peter Diplas (Greece). The paper outlined the socioeconomic position of women in the Community and then Community Initiative promote female employment, with special reference to the situation in Greece.
56. It is argued in the paper that inspite of the progress achieved in the area of equality between men and women, the right to work under equal conditions is still a long way off. Several studies show that the increased participation by women in the labour market has coincided with negative structural developments. An upturn in economic growth has led to a relative reduction in the unemployment rate for men. The figure for women, however, has not gone down but has in fact increased in certain Member States.
57. The gap has reached a stage where women's unemployment (12%) is almost double the rate for men (7%). An even greater cause for concern is the growing increase in the number of women in the ranks of the long-term unemployment; they now make up 55 % of the total.
58. Agricultural jobs account for nearly one third of working women and 21 % of working men in Greece, and for 21% of working women and 16% of working men in Portugal. In Spain and Italy the concentration of employment in agriculture is lower (10% of women and 13% of men for Spain, 9% for both sexes in Italy). In Ireland agriculture accounts for a larger share of male employment (21 %) but for women the share is similar to that for other Northern countries (5%). Agriculture is a mixed occupational area in Greece and Portugal where women hold 44% and 50% respectively of the jobs, while in Italy and in Spain women hold 35% and 27% respectively of the jobs and in Ireland only 10%.
59. In December 1990 the Commission launched a Community Initiative which was exclusively concerned with women and would reinforce efforts made in recent years to promote female employment at both national and Community level.
60. Since the end of 1991, the NOW Initiative in the E.U. and of course in Greece has received considerable publicity. In Greece this programme enables the bridging of the gap in women's vocational training, helping them to improve their access to the labour market by developing partnerships on a national level and also on a European scale.
61. In Greece in the first, second and third round of NOW Programme more than 150 projects were finally selected among nearly 500 proposals submitted by 280 organizations. These projects constitute along with their European partners, a network of more than 350 organisations in the KU. Overall in the 12 E.U. countries more than 900 transnational projects were selected making a European Network of more than 2 000 partners.
62. Several NOW projects are being carried out in a rural environment aiming at setting up enterprises or cooperatives in the agri-tourism sector, based on local resources.
63. Following this presentation, the Plenary discussion further elaborated the problems encountered in establishing the programmes at the operation level. These related to transnational coordination, interagency coordination and delays in funding. Inequality of the status of women was also briefly discussed.
64. A brief introduction to a "Fair Play" project which is being developed by the Central Organisation for Women on Rural Areas in the Netherlands was outlined. This project aims at improving the legal, fiscal and social position of farm women. It promotes training and information for women particularly in relation to the decision making process.
TOPIC 4
RESEARCH ON RURAL WOMEN AND YOUTH
65. The first paper on this topic "Research Programme on Rural Women and Youth was presented by Prof. Juan Manuel García Bartolomé (Spain). The paper outlined the methodology of a study on the socio professional status of women in Spanish agriculture. The study was initiated by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food as one of the activities within the Work Plan for Equal Opportunities for Women (1989/90). The methodology was based on the integrated use of qualitative and quantitative research techniques. More specifically, the qualitative stage comprised of 14 group discussions, 36 in-depth interviews and six meeting with experts in different agrarian environments. The quantitative stage comprised of four samples: the central sample was 6203 women on the farm household. The research was divided into 16 agricultural environments which reflect the differences in the women's role in different agrarian systems.
66. The central focus of the questionnaire was:
- Vocational and training background.
- Type of agricultural work carried out by women.
- Women's perception of the present and future farm situation and agricultural environments.
- Evaluation of institutional policies to promote rural women socio-professionally.
67. The second paper on the preliminary results of the "Socio-Economic Situation and Status of Rural Women in Selected Central and Eastern European Countries" was presented by Mrs. Pirjo Siiskonen (Finland).
68. The important highlights of the research are the following:
The biggest problems of rural women mentioned by the focal points in the participating countries were: unemployment (especially in the transition phase), declining incomes and other economical problems of rural women (especially in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovak Republic, Hungary and Bulgaria) due to the big social and political change, low level
