<title>Consultant Facilitator. Supporting aquaculture development in Africa: Research Network on Integration </title>
<section>1</section>
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Establishment of a Research Network on the Integration of
Aquaculture and Irrigation
THE IDENTIFICATION MISSION
As a follow-up to the Study on International Fisheries Research (SIFR, 1989-91), FAO, in collaboration with the Economic Commission for Africa and the European Union, launched in 1992 a regional study on aquaculture development and research in sub-Saharan Africa. The resulting synthesis of the information presented in 12 national reviews on development and research needs, provided the basis for proposing an indicative Action Plan for Aquaculture Research in sub-Saharan Africa in 1994. Eight priority research programmes were identified among which "Aquaculture in irrigation schemes" and "Small water body fisheries enhancement" were included. These programmes would operate as networks and would be supported by an Aquatic Systems Information Network already proposed in 1997.
Since 1995, the FAO Special Programme for Food Security (SPFS) is gradually being implemented in several African countries. It includes an irrigation component which should develop and demonstrate appropriate irrigation technologies which can be effectively sustained by small-scale farmers. The SPFS also includes a diversification component including rural aquaculture. Small-scale aquaculture could be successfully integrated with irrigation whenever local conditions permit, resulting in a number of varied benefits from practical, social, economical and agricultural points of views.
In the context of sub-Saharan Africa, small-water bodies (SWB) are generally defined as small man-made impoundments of water built primarily for domestic use, livestock watering, and/or irrigation, where fish production is usually a secondary use. SWB fisheries differ significantly from natural lake fisheries and are susceptible to enhancement. Seasonally variable water levels and the resulting magnification of environmental variation, artificial assemblages of mainly riverine fish species in a lacustrine environment, and relatively small surface areas are all characteristics which may be exploited through improved management and aquaculture techniques to increase fish production.
Aware of such potential developments, the Inland Water Resources and Aquaculture Service of the FAO Fisheries Department organized in October 1997 an identification mission in sub-Saharan Africa with the following objectives:
* to visit some of the existing research institutions previously identified as potential contributors to a research network for the integration of aquaculture and irrigation, including fisheries enhancement in small irrigation reservoirs;
* to evaluate the resources available in each of these institutions to contribute to such a network;
* to ascertain existing interest and willingness to do so;
* to briefly review the status of aquaculture and irrigation development in each country visited;
* to identify possible ways for integration and related constraints;
* to identify potential founder-members of this new research network;
* to identify a possible way for the initial establishment of such a network.
From 22 October to 21 November 1997, the mission visited various institutions concerned with fisheries and irrigation research and/or development in Ghana, Burkina Faso, Mali, Zambia and Zimbabwe. In each of them, it evaluated the potential participation of the visited country into a research network for the integration of aquaculture and irrigation on the basis of existing infrastructure and resources available to support research and development in the fields of aquaculture, small water bodies fishery enhancement and irrigation. Past experience in the integration of aquaculture into irrigation schemes was also reviewed.

GENERAL CONCLUSIONS
Aquaculture Research
Except in Ghana and in Zambia where aquaculture research infrastructure is being completed with external assistance, it is still rather rudimentary in the other three countries visited. Staff and financial resources are very limited in most countries, although in Zambia this situation could improve in the near future as a result of the training component of a new UNDP aquaculture project. In Ghana, aquaculture research will most probably receive increased attention following its integration within the Water Research Institute and the recent change in Government policy.
Aquaculture Development
In general, government resources (infrastructure, staff, finances) are rather limited, particularly in Burkina Faso, Mali and Zimbabwe. Although some private initiatives exist in Mali (stocking of small reservoirs) and in Ghana, they are particularly developed in Zambia (fish farms and small reservoirs). Extension services have been reorganized in most countries where the "training and visit" system is applied by polyvalent extensionists (unified system).
In all countries, juvenile fish production cannot cope with the demand. Wild juveniles of tilapias and African catfish are captured from reservoirs, floodplains and rivers by local fishermen mostly to stock small reservoirs. Annual aquaculture productions are relatively low (80-150 t), except in Ghana and in Zambia.
Small Water Bodies and their Fishery Enhancement
Fisheries enhancement in small water bodies (SWB) through stocking has been and/or is still being carried out in all the visited countries. In this last instance, private initiatives are mostly responsible, either at village level (Mali and Ghana) or at farm level (Zambia and Zimbabwe). The current situation in the countries visited is as follows:
Country
Fisheries enhancement in small water bodies
Burkina Faso More than 2 000 reservoirs, not all permanent
Renewed interest in their fisheries enhancement
Very little resources
New project for 250 reservoirs under discussion
Mali Numerous small reservoirs, floodplain depressions and earth-borrowing pits, generally seasonal
Renewed interest in their fisheries enhancement
Private initiatives especially
Ghana Numerous small reservoirs and dugouts in northern regions
Water Users Associations for their management
Dam rehabilitation projects (past, present and future)
Zambia Mostly in Eastern and Southern Provinces, where experience with community management exists; private initiatives on large commercial farms
Zimbabwe Many private initiatives on commercial farms
Some activity in communal lands for local community management promotion
During the past five years in Zambia and Zimbabwe, the FAO Aquaculture for Local Community Development Programme (ALCOM) has tested and developed, methodologies for the rapid evaluation of SWB fishery potential and for community-based enhancement/management of SWB fish resources. Guidelines are now being prepared which should prove useful for other countries.
Irrigation Potential and Development
Surface irrigation with full or partial water control which offers the best possibilities for integrating aquaculture, in particular in large-scale irrigation schemes, is mostly developed in Mali. Zambia and Zimbabwe have each more than 20000ha available, much more than Burkina Faso and Ghana. In this last country, the actually irrigated area is only 61percent of the equipped area, although great efforts are now made to rehabilitate old schemes.
Overhead irrigation
by sprinklers is particularly well developed in Zimbabwe and even in Zambia. Actual tendency is to prefer this irrigation system which uses available water resources much more efficiently. For the same reason, micro-irrigation (drip) is being increasingly used in southern Africa.
Wetlands and/or inland bottom valleys are particularly extended in Zambia where these dambos are traditionally irrigated by hand and where the SPFS is actually concentrating its efforts. It has been shown that several possibilities exist to integrate small-scale fish farming in such areas. Burkina Faso and Zimbabwe (as well as Ghana probably) have also relatively extended wetlands used by smallholders. In Mali, such areas are limited to the south western part of the country.
Flood-dependent irrigation is practiced in Mali in the Niger River valley over a large area. Results have been disappointing in recent years following the reduced river peak flood level. Little potential for integrating aquaculture exists in such type of irrigation schemes.
Irrigation potential is huge in Ghana and nearly four times greater than the potential in Mali and Zambia, the next countries with good potential. Smallest potential is found in Burkina Faso.
Integration of Aquaculture and Irrigation
All kinds of integration of aquaculture in large irrigation schemes have been tried in Mali a few years ago and further trials have been proposed more recently. Good experience is also present in Ghana where an integration policy exists for a long time. Even if several proposals have been made in Burkina Faso at the Sourou irrigation scheme in the past, none have been implemented, although the enhancement of SWB fisheries has been practiced throughout the country for several years.
As far as informal irrigation in wetlands is concerned, the Zambia SPFS is actively carrying out the most recent trials on small-scale fish farming integration into small-holder irrigation.
Special Programme for Food Security (FAO)
Integration of aquaculture into the SPFS irrigation component is well ahead in Zambia where it is has been supported by a full time aquaculturist, with technical assistance from a consultant and ALCOM. In the other countries, aquaculture is under consideration, but the SPFS has still to get fully underway.
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE INITIAL ESTABLISHMENT OF THE NETWORK
Identification of National Institutions to Become Involved in the Research Network for the Integration of Aquaculture and Irrigation - Phase 1
National institutions apt to become initially members of the new research network have been identified in each of the countries visited, except in Zimbabwe where a regional development project has been proposed.
The recommended institutions are as follows:
Country/town
Selected institutions
Remarks
Burkina Faso
Bobo-Dioulasso
Institut de Développement Rural (IDR) University structure responsible for training/research in agriculture, forestry and fisheries
Mali
Bamako
Institut d'Economie Rurale (IER) Responsible for agricultural research, including forestry and fisheries; development structures to be closely associated with IER
Ghana
Accra
Water Research Institute (WRI) Water and water-resources related research are integrated. Aquaculture Research and Development Centre at Akosombo
Zambia
Chilanga/Lusaka
Mount Makulu Regional Agricultural Research Centre
* to be closely assoc.with Dept.Fisheries (Research)
* part of Nat. Agricult. Research Network, in same Ministry as DOF
* hosts SPFS and FARMESA Prog.
Zimbabwe
Harare
ALCOM Regional Programme (SADC)
* to be closely assoc.with nat. Research structures (irrig/fish)
* developing SADC water resources database
* good experience with networking in Info Service and SWB Unit
* regional authority on small-scale aquacult. and SWB enhancement
Coordination with Existing African Networks
The new research network for aquaculture integration into irrigation schemes should become closely associated with other networks active in Africa and specialized in irrigation, regional development or fisheries.
Future collaboration with these networks will be particularly useful for the organization of seminars/workshops, for group training and for dissemination of information through existing channels such as newsletters and publications.
Establishment of the New Network
It is proposed that the following steps be successively taken to initially establish the new network:
(i) An official invitation should be addressed by FAO to the Director of the selected institutions to participate in the Seminar proposed below.
ii) Author's contracts should be issued for the preparation of national reviews/syntheses according to a standard framework by each of the institutions having expressed an interest to participate in the Seminar, with or without support from other institutions according to needs.
iii) A Seminar to be organized with the objectives of:
* reviewing the development and research constraints existing in the participating countries, in particular following the outline agreed for the national reviews;
* discussing the future organization responsibilities and functioning of the new network, in particular from the point of view of using two languages, English and French;
* agreeing on applied research priorities and a research programme for the new network to support the development of the integration of aquaculture and irrigation;
* recommending how such research could be carried out in the field in each of the involved countries, with particular attention to the human and financial resources to be mobilized to this effect; and
* recommending how best close links could be established with other existing African networks of interest.
Participants in such seminar should include representatives from the selected countries, directly involved in research and/or development of irrigation, aquaculture and SWB fisheries. Representatives of other existing networks should also be invited to share their past experiences with networking and to stimulate future collaborative activities.
Potential Research Subjects for the New Network
A series of research topics are suggested, addressing both general and particular aspects of aquaculture integrated into irrigation schemes. Specialized research should be considered for:
* undrainable fish farming structures;
* ponds with an unusually high water exchange rate;
* ponds built in waterlogged areas, in terrain depressions or in borrowing pits;
* fish farming in paddy fields;
* fish production in irrigation canals, either in pens or in floating cages;
* culture-based fisheries either in irrigation canals or in small irrigation reservoirs.

1.1 Origin, Organization and Objectives of the Mission
As a follow-up to the Study on International Fisheries Research (SIFR, 1989-91), FAO, in collaboration with the Economic Commission for Africa and the European Union, launched in 1992 a regional study on aquaculture development and research in sub-Saharan Africa.
The resulting synthesis of the information presented in 12 national reviews on development and research needs provided the basis for proposing an indicative Action Plan for Aquaculture Research in sub-Saharan Africa (Coche, Haight and Vincke, 1994; Coche, 1994).
Eight priority research programmes were identified among which "Aquaculture in irrigation schemes" and "Small water body fisheries enhancement", to be supported by an Aquatic Systems Information Network (Coche and Collins, 1997).
Since 1995, the FAO Special Programme for Food Security (SPFS, Section 1.2) is gradually being implemented in several African countries. It usually includes an irrigation component into which small-scale aquaculture can be integrated successfully.
In July 1997, a seminar on the "Contribution of Fisheries in Man-made Lakes and Irrigation Dams to Food Security in the Sahelian Zone" was organized by the FAO Regional Office for Africa within the framework of the Sahel sub-committee of the Committee for Inland Fisheries of Africa (CIFA). Among its recommendations to Member Governments, the seminar stressed that:
* there should be an increase in the number of dams to harvest available water resources;
* reservoir management should include watershed management for its strategies to be successful;
* when designing/planning any new dam, fisheries aspects should be considered from the onset;
* inter-regional networking should be initiated to exchange information and avoid duplication of efforts;
* aquacultural development should focus on improved management of and output from reservoirs through stocking and improved harvesting techniques.
The seminar also recommended that FAO should facilitate inter-regional networking and information exchange.
As follow-up to these activities and using the Partnership Programme Scheme, the Inland Water Resources and Aquaculture Service of the FAO Fisheries Department organized in October 1997 an identification mission in sub-Saharan Africa with the following objectives:
* to visit some of the existing research institutions previously identified as potential contributors to a research network on the integration of aquaculture and irrigation, including fisheries enhancement in small irrigation reservoirs;
* to evaluate the resources available in each of these institutions to contribute to such a network;
* to ascertain existing interest and willingness to do so;
* to briefly review the status of aquaculture and irrigation development in each country visited;
* to identify possible ways for integration and related constraints;
* to identify potential founder-members of this new research network;
* to identify a possible way for the initial establishment of such a multidisciplinary network at sub-Saharan African level.
Before being fielded, the mission was briefed on aquaculture, irrigation and SPFS subjects in FAO Headquarters, Rome, as follows:
* Agriculture Department
* Land and Water Development Division,
Water Resources, Development and Management Service (AGLW)
* Kandiah, A. (Zimbabwe)
* Faures, J.-M. (Burkina Faso)

* Clement, D. (SPFS/Mali)
* Fisheries Department
* Fishery Resources Division,
Inland Water Resources and Aquaculture Service (FIRI)
* Pedini, M. (Aquaculture and overall coordination of the mission)
The identification mission visited various institutions in Sahelian, western and southern Africa between 22 October and 21 November 1997, as follows:
* from 22 to 27 October, Ghana;
* from 29 October to 4 November, Burkina Faso;
* from 5 to 12 November, Mali;
* from 13 to 17 November, Zambia;
* from 18 to 21 November, Zimbabwe.
A more detailed schedule of the mission together with names of institutions/projects visited are provided as an Annex.
Each country visited is the subject of a separate Chapter (Chapters 2 to 6) where a list of persons met, generalities about aquaculture and irrigation, details about visited institutions/projects (research or development oriented) and literature consulted, are successively given.
1.2 FAO Special Programme for Food Security
The Special Programme for Food Security (SPFS) was launched by FAO in September 1994. Its objectives are:
* to sustainably increase food production and productivity through widespread dissemination of improved technologies and management practices in areas with high potential;
* to create an economic and social environment conducive to food production.
SPFS is guided by the following basic principles:
* national ownership, through direct government involvement;
* focus on areas and foods with a high potential, primarily staple food crops (cereals, roots, tubers), with possible integration of others, such as vegetables, poultry, livestock and fish;
* participatory approach;
* environmental awareness/sensitivity;
* regard for women's role, particularly important in food crop production.
SPFS strategy
includes:
* food security through irrigation and intensification;
* diversification (e.g., aquaculture).
Implementation is in two phases:
* a pilot phase including on-farm trials and demonstrations of improved technologies and management practices, full participation of the local community in their evaluation and in the identification of adoption constraints/practical ways to remove them, as well as water management (conservation and storage to ensure a reliable water supply);
* an expansion phase.
The SPFS irrigation component should develop and demonstrate appropriate irrigation technologies which can be effectively sustained by small-scale farmers.
The SPFS aquaculture component should be preferably fully integrated with the irrigation component and, as far as possible, with the animal husbandry component if present.
1.3 Positive Aspects of Aquaculture-Irrigation Integration
The integration of aquaculture and irrigation can result, for the smallholder farmer in particular, in a number of varied benefits.
From a practical point of view, the presence of a water storage facility:
* improves domestic water use (closer supply, time saving);
* allows livestock watering;
* allows crop irrigation;
* allows fish farming.
From the social point of view, integrated fish farming:
* improves the household nutritional situation; animal proteins are often lacking in the diet of smallholders, in particular for growing children and child-bearing or breast-feeding women;
* provides fish which can be easily harvested, as required by the household;
* directly improves household food security; farmers with access to irrigation and producing a variety of cash crops generally sell a great part of their horticultural crops and use the largest part of their fish production for home consumption (van der Mheen, 1996);
* contributes to production diversification and risk avoidance.
From the economical point of view, integrated fish farming:
* requires a small investment, mostly for juvenile fish if they are not on-farm produced;
* produces fresh fish, usually a high-value cash crop;
* gives the opportunity for additional income;
* can give fast returns on investment if the production cycle is kept relatively short;
* may be economically more profitable than irrigated crop farming, as observed in southern Africa (van der Mheen, 1996);
* may provide a way to produce a positive economic return in irrigation networks where soil salinization has reduced economic returns of crops below acceptable levels;
* produces a crop with greater marketing flexibility than most other crops, fish being easily stored alive in ponds for as long as necessary.
From the irrigation point of view, integrated pond fish farming:
* optimizes the use of water, its consumption being limited to evaporation and seepage losses from reduced surfaces;
* may allow an irrigation schedule much more flexible and better adapted to the real needs of the crop if irrigation water is obtained from an individual storage pond;
* may allow farmers to use an improved irrigation system, such as overhead or micro-irrigation, if irrigation water is stored at a higher elevation in a pond;
* may assist in regulating periodic excessive water flow or in greatly reducing losses of unused water through intermediate pond storage;
* in irrigation schemes where salt accumulation reduces crop production, fish farming can assist in rehabilitating salinized areas within a few years and on an economical basis;
* is adopted by farmers used to irrigation practices more easily than by dryland farmers as demonstrated in Madagascar, Mozambique and Tanzania (van der Mheen, 1996).
From the farming system point of view, integrated fish farming:
* improves the use of on-farm resources, such as water, inputs and labour;
* allows a more effective recycling of the farm/garden by-products and wastes;
* enhances the overall management and production of smallholder farms;
* contributes to an increased sustainability.
1.4 Constraints to Aquaculture-Irrigation Integration
Integration of aquaculture and irrigation is not always feasible and numerous previous attempts have failed for not taking into consideration the following:
* it is possible only if there is a reliable source of water and suitable soils;
* it should be socially acceptable to the farmer concerned;
* it does not interfere with the existing irrigation system;
* it does not excessively compete with the existing elements of the farming system for scarce land and/or water, or for on-farm produced organic wastes and by-products preferably allocated to agricultural crops and animal husbandry respectively (van der Mheen, 1997).
1.5 Small-water Body Fisheries in Africa
In the context of sub-Saharan Africa, small-water bodies (SWB) are generally defined as small man-made impoundments of water built primarily for domestic use, livestock watering, and/or irrigation, where fish production is usually a secondary use, but can nevertheless produce an important amount of fish for consumption and sale by the local community. They are particularly numerous in northern and southern subtropical African countries.
SWB fisheries differ significantly from natural lake fisheries and are susceptible to enhancement (Section 8.1.3). Seasonally variable water levels and the resulting magnification of environmental variation, artificial assemblages of mainly riverine fish species in a lacustrine environment, and relatively small surface areas are all characteristics which could be exploited through improved management and aquaculture techniques to increase fish production.
Management and enhancement of small water body fisheries has been intensively studied at the SIDA/Belgium/FAO Programme on "Aquatic Resources Management for Local Communities" (Chapter 6, Section 4.1).

2. IRRIGATED AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES DEVELOPMENT: GOVERNMENT POLICIES AND STRATEGIES
2.1 Decentralization Policy
Since 1988, the Government of Ghana (GOG) has introduced decentralization, establishing within the existing 10 administrative Regions (Figure 1) 110 Districts to become focal points for local development. Since then, considerable legislative power has been given to the District Assemblies which have become the second highest legislative body in the country. Assembly decisions are to be executed by the district administration and 22 decentralized government departments.
Each year, 10 per cent of the national budget is attributed to the District Assemblies to support local development, the agriculture sector (incl. fisheries) receiving 20 per cent of this allocation
2.2 Reorganization of Agricultural Extension Services
The Ministry of Food and Agriculture (MOFA) is being completely restructured with assistance from the Agricultural Services Investment Project (ASIP) financed by the World Bank (WB). The latter also finances the National Agricultural Extension Project (NAEP) responsible for reorganizing and reinforcing the MOFA Department of Agricultural Extension Services (DAES). Main activities involve:
* the establishment of a unified extension system in which agriculture extensionists (Frontline Staff - FLS) are polyvalent and responsible for delivering to the rural population messages related to all disciplines relevant to development, such as crops, animal husbandry, human health, capture fisheries and fish farming. Subject Matter Specialists (SMS) should be available at Region and District levels to support the FLS.
* the training of FLS and SMS at Region/District levels
* the establishment of Research - Extension Linkage Committees responsible for the two-way flow of information between farmers, extension staff and researchers.
2.3 Irrigated Agriculture Development
Irrigated agriculture development has been given high priority by GOG for some years. Such priority has been reiterated in the Medium-Term Agricultural Development Plan (1991 - 2000), which also specifies the strategy to be applied for sustainable irrigation agriculture. It includes:
* reduction of operating costs;
* completion of the development of existing irrigation schemes;
* focus on small-scale (less than 100 ha) and micro-scale (a few ha) irrigation schemes;
* giving priority to schemes, mainly rice, with water control in seasonally inundated areas and valley bottoms;
* favouring management of small-scale irrigation schemes by the farmers themselves through the establishment of Cooperative Societies or Farmers Associations;
* promoting expansion of rice growing areas and intensification to meet increas
