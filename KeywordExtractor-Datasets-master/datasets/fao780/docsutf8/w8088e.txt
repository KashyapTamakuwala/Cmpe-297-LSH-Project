<title>Food Quality and Safety Systems - A Training Manual on Food Hygiene and the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) System</title>
<section>1</section>
Foreword
The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) is the principal specialized UN agency dealing with all aspects of food quality and safety throughout each of the stages of food production, storage, transportation, processing and marketing. Work in this area is carried out by the Food Quality and Standards Service of the FAO Food and Nutrition Division. Activities include providing policy advice and executing food quality control and safety development projects, including the development of food standards and technical regulations; food quality and safety assurance programmes for the food industry; establishing national export food certification programmes; monitoring programmes for food contaminants; and conducting regional and national seminars and workshops on food control issues.
One important element of FAO's work is building the capacity of food control personnel, including government authorities and food industry personnel carrying out food quality and safety assurance programmes. Such programmes should include specific food risk control procedures such as the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) system.
In December 1994, FAO held an expert consultation on HACCP principles in food control. The experts recommended that FAO should continue to emphasize high-quality and effective food industry and government HACCP training, based on the development of a core curriculum and the harmonized text and guidelines of the Codex Alimentarius Commission.
In February 1995, an ad hoc working group was formed and a core curriculum was developed for a training of trainers programme. The core curriculum recognizes the importance of the basic quality and safety controls included in the Codex General Principles of Food Hygiene and good manufacturing practices as embodied in the Codex Codes of Practice as a basis for effective implementation of the HACCP system. The training programme has been tested in Thailand, Brazil, Viet Nam and Slovakia. This training manual on food quality and safety systems is a direct result of that work.
The manual is structured to provide essential information in a standardized, logical and systematic manner while adhering to effective teaching and learning strategies. It is composed of three sections. Section 1 reviews principles and methods of training; Section 2 introduces and elucidates the Codex Alimentarius General Principles of Food Hygiene; and Section 3 explains the HACCP system and its implementation. Each section is made up of specific training modules which can be combined and customized to meet the specific needs of the students.
FAO has prepared this manual in an effort to harmonize the approach to training in the HACCP system based on the already harmonized texts and guidelines of the Codex Alimentarius Commission. It is clear that HACCP systems can only be effective when they are a part of a broader food quality and safety programme based on the General Principles of Food Hygiene and good manufacturing practices. Consequently, these aspects of quality and safety controls are incorporated in the training materials. We invite readers' comments and suggestions for improving this manual as part of our continuing effort to provide high-quality advice and reference materials to FAO member countries.

Preface
All countries need adequate food control programmes to ensure that national food supplies are safe, of good quality and available in adequate amounts at affordable prices to ensure an acceptable nutritional and health status for all population groups. Food control includes all activities carried out to ensure the quality, safety and honest presentation of the food at all stages from primary production, through processing and storage, to marketing and consumption. The term has been used to describe a total national effort involving an integrated approach between government and all segments and sectors of the food industry. Food control is linked to improvement in the health of the population, potential for a country's economic development and reduction of spoilage and food losses.
The Codex Alimentarius General Principles of Food Hygiene lay a firm foundation for ensuring effective food control and food hygiene. The General Principles of Food Hygiene follow the food chain from primary production through to the consumer, highlighting the key hygiene controls at each stage. A Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) approach is recommended wherever possible to enhance food safety. The HACCP approach is internationally recognized as being effective in ensuring the safety and suitability of food for human consumption and in international trade.
Recognizing the importance of HACCP to food control, the twentieth session of the Codex Alimentarius Commission, held in Geneva, Switzerland from 28 June to 7 July 1993, adopted Guidelines for the application of the Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) system (ALINORM 93/13A, Appendix II). The revised version of the Recommended International Code of Practice - General Principles of Food Hygiene [CAC/RCP 1-1969, Rev. 3 (1997)], adopted during the twenty-second session of the Codex Alimentarius Commission, held in Geneva from 23 to 28 June 1997, incorporates the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) system and guidelines for its application as Annex.
The HACCP system, as it applies to food safety management, uses the approach of controlling critical points in food handling to prevent food safety problems. Besides enhancing food safety, other benefits of applying HACCP include effective use of resources and timely response to food safety problems. In addition, the application of the HACCP system can result in more focused risk management by food control regulatory authorities and can promote international trade by increasing buyer confidence in food safety.
The HACCP system identities specific hazards and control measures to ensure the safety of food. An HACCP plan is specific to the particular food and processing application. The HACCP system is capable of accommodating change, such as advances in equipment design, new information concerning health hazards or risks, new processing procedures or technological developments.
The successful application of HACCP requires the full commitment and involvement of management and the workforce. It also requires a team approach. The application of the HACCP system is compatible with the implementation of quality management systems, such as the ISO 9000 series, and HACCP is the system of choice for the management of food safety within such systems.
HACCP and trade
Significant implications for the Codex Alimentarius Commission arise from the Final Act of the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT): the Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS Agreement) and the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT Agreement). Codex standards, guidelines and other recommendations have become the specifically identified baseline for consumer protection under the SPS Agreement. In this environment they take on unprecedented importance with respect to consumer protection and international food trade. As a result, the work of the Codex Alimentarius Commission (including the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point [HACCP] system and guidelines for its application) has become the reference for international food safety requirements.
While the improved level of food safety associated with the implementation of HACCP and the leading role taken by the food industry are recognized, the application of HACCP as a public policy requires definition of the role of government in the utilization of the HACCP process and risk analysis. Individual countries need to address the issue of HACCP implementation so that their food export industry can meet the requirement recently adopted by some importing countries related to HACCP application to food products. The mandatory requirement to use HACCP and any subsequent barriers or other constraints to trade, particularly for developing countries, need to be considered and identified. The appropriate application of HACCP to different segments of the food chain and the impact of this application on small and medium-sized food industries also needs to be addressed.
Recent FAO activities
Recognizing the importance of HACCP in food control and the necessity and importance of improving the safety of food in international trade, and to address the issues identified above, FAO convened an expert technical meeting in Vancouver, Canada from 12 to 16 December 1994 to discuss the use of HACCP principles in food control.
The expert technical meeting noted that training in the application and implementation of the HACCP system was of utmost importance and recommended that FAO consider assuming the leadership role in conducting high-quality and effective industry and government HACCP training. In their report, the experts also recommended that FAO establish an inventory of available HACCP models and training reference material and prepare a core curriculum for practical HACCP training courses. It was recommended that the training be focused on developing skills and methods necessary for training government and industry representatives in the requirements of the Codex General Principles of Food Hygiene and the principles and steps in implementation of HACCP. Further, the core curriculum should be modifiable to reflect cultural sensitivities and to address infrastructural problems in individual countries.
As follow-up to the training recommendations of the expert technical meeting, FAO convened a temporary technical working group which met in Rome from 13 to 17 February 1995 to plan a training of trainers course in HACCP for developing countries. The temporary technical working group consisted of representatives from the Centre of Export Inspection and Certification of Agricultural Products, Thailand Department of Agriculture; the Thai Food Industry; and international experts in food sanitation and hygiene, HACCP and training techniques. The working group prepared a tentative agenda for a course on training of trainers in the application of HACCP to be held in Thailand.
The meeting participants agreed that the objectives of the training should be to promote a common approach to the application of HACCP based on the Codex guidelines and to instil trainers where possible with sufficient skills in the theory and application of HACCP to train others. The training should establish agreed terminology and basic understanding of HACCP principles and impart to the trainees those skills necessary for the application of HACCP to food safety in both the public and private sectors.
Two pilot training courses were carried out in Cha Am, Thailand (31 July to 11 August 1995) and Sao Paulo/Brazil (12 to 23 August 1996). It was concluded that the course format achieved its objective of imparting a thorough understanding of the technical information and its application to the participants. Participants completing the course demonstrated practical knowledge of the General Principles of Food Hygiene and the application of the HACCP system and the ability to train other people.
The FAO approach to the HACCP system
There is a tremendous demand for training in the HACCP system and the development and assembly of reference materials to support this training, particularly in developing countries. It is a matter of urgency to provide the necessary clarification with regard to the application of the HACCP system.
The objective of the FAO HACCP training programme is to promote good manufacturing practices (GMPs) and the HACCP system through understanding and application of the Codex General Principles of Food Hygiene, including the Codex guidelines for the application of the HACCP system and other Codex codes of hygienic practice. FAO is working to enhance the role of science and risk analysis in the development of the HACCP system and to create a framework for determining equivalence of food safety control programmes for a harmonized approach to the application of HACCP.
The FAO training programme harmonizes the approach to GMPs and the application of the HACCP system and aims to provide an effective mechanism for delivering the appropriate core curriculum and knowledge to selected segments and sectors of the food industry, individuals involved to varying degrees in the preparation, monitoring, administration and verification of HACCP plans and food control regulators. Included in the FAO training programme is emphasis on training the trainers who are in a position to train others and to apply the knowledge gained and hence to contribute to self-reliance, particularly in developing countries.
To accomplish these objectives, FAO has embarked on a plan to develop further collaboration and partnerships with regional and national counterparts, where possible with other international organizations and with the food industry to review the needs of the developing countries regarding their HACCP system implementation plans and to establish workable strategies.
The training package
Training is not an objective in itself but is linked to improvement in a country's public health and economic development. It is in this context, and recognizing the need to standardize GMPs and HACCP training, that FAO has prepared the training package on the Codex Alimentarius General Principles of Food Hygiene and the application of the HACCP system. In order to harmonize or standardize the approach to training/Sections 2 and 3 of the training package are formatted around the Codex Recommended International Code of Practice - General Principles of Food Hygiene and the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) system and guidelines for its application. The training manual consists of three sections:
· Section 1: Principles and methods of training
· Section 2: Recommended International Code of Practice - General Principles of Food Hygiene
· Section 3: The Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) system
Each section is composed of training modules; this format allows for the training material to be combined and customized as appropriate to the specific trainees. Sections and/or modules can be selected by the instructor as appropriate to the level of knowledge, experience and specific responsibilities of the trainees in a given course.
An introductory section for each module outlines the objective, suggested methods of instruction, teaching aids and/or references, lesson content, presentation suggestions or exercises, anticipated time frame for instruction and anticipated learning outcome for the trainees.
The FAO training programme is not static; because of its modular approach it is sufficiently flexible to adapt to the evolution of food safety programmes and requirements. Modules can be added, deleted or amended as appropriate to remain current and to provide the appropriate training materials.
Content and material have been selected and structured to ensure that the training package provides essential information in a standardized, logical and systematic manner while adhering to effective teaching and learning strategies. The package is intended to standardize the training approach and to reduce the research and preparation time normally required by an instructor offering comprehensive courses of this nature. It should be noted, however, that the contribution of the individual instructor is essential to the success of the training. The instructor may add material as appropriate to the specific training. The instructor's personal experiences, elaboration and discussion of key points, anecdotes, review and questioning opportunities and involvement of the students are the means by which the material will be communicated, absorbed, enjoyed and understood.

Section 1 - PRINCIPLES AND METHODS OF TRAINING
Introduction
Module 1 - Principles of effective communication - "Getting the message across"
Module 2 - Effective oral communication
Module 3 - Why train? The trainer's role and responsibility
Module 4 - Methods of training - The right method
Module 5 - The art of questioning
Module 6 - Types of training aids - How to make and use them
Module 7 - Planning and delivering a presentation
Module 8 - Evaluating training
Module 9 - Testing trainee trainers - Individual presentations
Module 10 - Organizing and managing a training course
Introduction
The objective of Section 1 is to address the basic elements necessary for the effective preparation, implementation and evaluation of training, with the aim of that training being "to get the message across".
To achieve that objective, the modules that follow are intended to provide guidance to trainers in the skills of conveying their message successfully and transferring related information.
Training is essentially the instructing of others in information new to them and its application. It may, and often does, involve the teaching of new skills, methods and procedures.
Very few people are born trainers, and most of those who wish to be trainers require training. Even those few who are born trainers benefit from training, and their effectiveness is enhanced as a result.
The most important element in a training situation is the trainer. The trainer who is enthusiastic, energetic and genuinely interested in both the subject and getting his or her message across will evoke the greatest response from the trainees. The trainer who lacks interest in training, who has little or no enthusiasm for the subject of the training and who merely goes through the motions of training is a failure. Such a trainer wastes not only his or her own time but also that of the trainees. The inept trainer is quickly identified by the trainees, who react with inattention, lassitude, undisciplined behaviour and absence from training sessions.
Successful training - that which produces the desired result - lies almost entirely in the hands of the trainer. In the trainer's hands lies the heavy responsibility for ensuring that the trainees achieve the maximum possible from the training.
A measure of the success of training is the relationship that develops between trainer and trainees. In a sound, productive training situation there is mutual respect and trust between them, with the trainer taking care to ensure that even the weakest trainee performs to the highest possible level, and the trainees feeling a desire within themselves to achieve. In this situation the trainer is the motivator and the trainees are the motivated.
It is intended that the modules that follow will be of assistance to those wishing to train and those already training.
The modules have been arranged as follows:
· Module 1: Principles of effective communication - "Getting the message across"
· Module 2: Effective oral communication
· Module 3: Why train? The trainer's role and responsibility
· Module 4: Methods of training - The right method
· Module 5: The art of questioning
· Module 6: Types of training aids - How to make and use them
· Module 7: Planning and delivering a presentation
· Module 8: Evaluating training
· Module 9: Testing trainee trainers - Individual presentations
· Module 10: Organizing and managing a training course
The above arrangement is systematic. Modules 1 and 2 deal with training theory. Module 3 is transitional in that it links the theory with the applied training methods covered by Modules 4 to 7. Modules 8 and 9 cover the important aspect of measuring and assessing the effectiveness of the training and the trainer. Module 10 is related to the management of training or, in other words, creating a favourable environment in which to train.
It is important that all members of a training team be familiar with the principles espoused in the training modules. This ensures that every presentation in a training course embodies the principles and in itself is a demonstration of the application of those principles: the trainees are not only told how to train, but see how it should be done.
It is stressed that the modules are not intended to constitute a textbook on training. Essentially, their contents are intended as memory joggers for those trained to train others. For this reason, and depending on the nature of the subject, some material is presented in point form while other material is covered by full text.
The training segment of this programme provides only the supports of training theory and practice. This places a heavier than normal responsibility on the trainer, who must in the span of ten hours make the deepest possible impression on the trainees if they are to be turned out as proficient trainers. This means not only that the trainer must be familiar with and skilled in presenting the training information and related methods, but that he or she must be at least familiar with many other aspects of training not covered by the modules, for example, motivation theory, the art of public speaking, conducting discussions, course planning, written communication and so on. A knowledge of these subjects enables the trainer to weave appropriate strands from them into the presentations of the modules, thus broadening the trainees' experience. There are many excellent texts on training as well as training manuals produced by training units in government ministries and departments,
private companies and other organizations. Dedicated trainers make it an essential part of their continuing education as professionals to locate such publications in libraries or elsewhere, and by so doing keep abreast of theory and practice.
Module 1 - Principles of effective communication - "Getting the message across"
Objective
To familiarize the participants with the elementary principles of successful oral communication of information and to heighten awareness of the factors that interfere with communication and reduce its effectiveness
Suggested method of instruction
· Lecture/discussion with maximum trainee participation through questioning and relating of personal experience
Aids
· Overhead transparencies
· Handouts
Time frame
· One hour lecture/discussion
Content
· Effective communication
· Interference
· Ways of avoiding interference
Presentation suggestions
The foregoing module is easily adapted to discussion. The trainer should attempt to elicit from the trainees their experiences with transmission, interference and ways of avoiding interference, which are well within the purview of trainee experience.
Trainees should be asked to tell the course participants about good communicators and poor communicators they have known, describing why they are memorable. The reasons they give should be related to the types of interference and ways in which interference was or could have been avoided.
Such a discussion invariably brings out other indirectly related aspects of spoken communication which provide points of reference when subjects in later modules are being dealt with.
Learning outcome
Participants should be aware of effective communication principles.
EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION
Communication specialists compare the way people communicate to the way a radio transmission takes place. That is to say:
Transmitter (Speaker/writer) ® Message ® Receiver (Listener/reader)
Three types of transmission are identified:
· Spoken
· Written
· Gesture/sometimes referred to as "body language"
Transmission is in code:
· Spoken language
· Written language
· Gestures
In spoken language the unit of code is the word, heavily supported by gestures. Some communication specialists believe that at least 40 percent of the full meaning of messages transmitted by speech is conveyed by body language (gestures). In written language the units of code are words and symbols (e.g. figures, punctuation). In the remainder of this module and the modules that follow reference to communication is to spoken communication only and assumes the transmitter can be seen by the receiver.
Successful communication depends on the message being received by the receiver intact and interpreted by the receiver to have the same meaning as when transmitted
INTERFERENCE
Frequently the message suffers from interference. That is, something interferes with the message between its transmission and reception and distorts it. The following are some types of interference.
Weak transmission
· Speaking too softly
· Speaking in a flat voice (monotone) without inflection
· Not speaking in a direct line with the receiver
· Insufficient volume of transmission to prevail over competing transmissions and localized noise (static)
Garbled transmission
The transmitter (speaker) often scrambles the contents of the message so that the facts it contains are not in logical order and often appear unrelated.
Wrong language
The transmitter may use words, terms and expressions unknown to the receiver.
Pitching message at the wrong level
The speaker may transmit information in a context beyond the experience of the receiver (this may involve the use of wrong language). This is sometimes called "transmitting or talking over the receiver's head". Examples are teaching food control procedures or HACCP to people who have no experience in food safety or food processing, or transmitting detailed and profound scientific messages to a receiver without a scientific background.
Receiver not receiving
· Receiver turned off (gone to sleep!)
· Tuned into another transmitter
· Transmission too weak
· Strength of receiver diminished (lack of interest - boredom)
· Receiver distracted by a competing focus of interest (an attractive person walks by)
· Receiver fatigued
Competing transmissions
The receiver may be unable to select between transmissions (too many people talking at once).
Overloading the message
The receiver does not possess the capacity to retain all of the information contained in the message. This frequently leads to receiver confusion/fatigue and anxiety.
WAYS OF AVOIDING INTERFERENCE
· Speak up and out
· Speak slowly and deliberately
· Use language that the receiver understands
· Do not talk over the receiver's head
· Ensure you have the attention of the receiver
· Only transmit your message in suitable surroundings where there is no, or little, competition
· Make the message succinct (as few words as possible) and transmit it in the simplest terms
· Plan the message in logical order
As a trainer it is essential that you get your message across-otherwise your effort to train will be wasted
SUMMARY
To be a successful communicator
· Use your voice effectively
· Know your subject
· Know what you want to say
· Prepare your message carefully
· Arrange your points logically
· Display interest and enthusiasm
· Sound convincing and sincere
Module 2 - Effective oral communication
Objective
To assist the trainee-trainers to identify and become acquainted with the essential elements of getting the message across and becoming an effective oral communicator
Suggested method of instruction
· Lecture/discussion with maximum trainee participation through questioning
· An exercise in impromptu speaking to an audience
Aids
· Overhead transparencies
· Handouts
Time frame
· One hour lecture/discussion
· One hour of approximately three-minute impromptu speeches (time depends on the number of participants)
Content
· The importance of being an effective oral communicator
· Essential elements in transmitting a message
· Communication hazards
Presentation suggestions
The trainer should put much effort into preparing for presentation of this module.
The presentation should commence with a discussion based on a series of questions carefully devised by the trainer, for example:
· What makes a good communicator? (This question is a link to Module 1 and offers the opportunity for a few minutes revision of the previous module).
· What are the essential characteristics of effective oral communication?
It is important that the trainees identify the characteristics and convert them to elements by themselves. As each is identified it could be discussed in detail.
The trainer can project transparencies showing the elements to reinforce them in the minds of trainees, but only after they have been identified by the trainees.
Exercise
Each trainee is required to give a three- to four-minute impromptu talk. The following are examples of possible subjects:
· My reasons for attending the course
· The aspect of my work I enjoy the most
· Why I think HACCP (or food control) is important
In giving this talk the trainee will be expected to take into account the essential elements in transmitting a message.
A handout sheet may be helpful to assist the trainees with their short presentations. The following is an example:
· Describe your work.
· Why is it important to you?
· Which aspect of your work do you enjoy the most?
· Which aspect do you dislike the most?
· What do you think you are best at?
· What aspect of your work would you like to know more about?
· If you had a choice, which aspect of "Quality control" would you like to specialize in and why?
Learning outcome
The participants should be familiar with the essential elements of effective oral communication.
THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING AN EFFECTIVE ORAL COMMUNICATOR
As a trainer much of your effectiveness is measured by your ability to speak with clarity and conviction in getting your messages across.
Men and women in training positions are expected to be highly competent at presenting ideas, giving directions and explaining procedures. In fact, this quality of being an effective communicator is generally considered to be an essential element of the effective trainer's skills.
The information you communicate as a trainer is often critical to the people you train and to the workings of the organization as a whole. The way you explain procedures or give directions can make the difference between an employee being productive or frustrated. Sometimes clear information from you can make the difference between people doing a job safely or unsafely, working efficiently or inefficiently or doing things correctly or incorrectly.
How you present even an obviously brilliant idea can make the difference between whether or not anyone listens to you. The way in which you interpret and transmit information about agency policies, goals, values and procedures has significant influence on the way your staff or subordinates develop their perceptions and their commitments to the organization.
Communicating clearly - "getting your message across" - is not an inherited ability; people are not born with it. It is a learned skill developed through planning and practice.
ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS IN TRANSMITTING A MESSAGE
State the purpose and main point of your message
This encourages receivers (listeners) to focus on your information and be more receptive. They will not be distracted by trying to guess what your point is, but will be mentally prepared to follow along as you develop your discussion.
Stating your main point right away captures your listeners' attention and helps them remember the most important part of your message.
Introductory phrases like the following help to make your purpose clear at the start.
· My purpose in speaking to you is...
· It is important that I discuss with you...
· The subject of what I have to say to you is...
· As a result of new policies adopted by the organization you should know...
After the main point has been made, it can be highlighted with expressions like:
· Now, what this means in effect is...
· Put in another way, this means...
· You can expect that what will happen next will be...
· My main concern about this proposal is...
· The point that I wish to emphasize is...
Strengthen your main point with supporting points
Your explanations, instructions or ideas are more compelling when supported by clear facts and observations. Your objective is to gain respect and belief from your listeners and for them to gain insight into the details of the message you are communicating. The following guidelines will make the transmission of your message effective.
· Use simple language. Avoid technical jargon unless you are sure that everyone understands it.
· Keep your explanation short so you do not risk boring people. Do not swamp them with unnecessary detail (which is called "overloading").
·
