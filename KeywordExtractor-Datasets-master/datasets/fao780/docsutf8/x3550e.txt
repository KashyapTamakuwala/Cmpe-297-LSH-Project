Foreword
In 1996 world leaders, gathered at the World Food Summit in Rome, committed their countries to halving the number of hungry by the year 2015. Achieving this goal will require concerted action by many, and on a broad front. FAO, which convened the Summit, has a major role to play in encouraging and monitoring progress, and an important and direct contribution to make through its own programmes for providing assistance to Members.
This Strategic Framework was approved by the FAO Conference, at its 30th Session in November 1999, to guide the work of FAO until the year 2015. It provides the authoritative framework for the Organization's future programmes, which will be developed through successive Medium-Term Plans and Programmes of Work and Budget.
It has been formulated through extensive consultations with FAO's stakeholders:
* its Members, through direct correspondence and through no less than 14 inter-governmental meetings, including the Conference that approved it;
* its partners, including UN system and other intergovernmental organizations, and non-governmental and other civil society organizations, through reviews of earlier drafts and participation as observers in FAO meetings;
* its Secretariat staff, whose proposals formed the basis for the first draft and who have contributed to intensive discussions within and between departments as the document has evolved.
Taking into account developments expected in the external environment over the coming years, and in the light of the Organization's mandate and mission, the Strategic Framework for the period 2000-2015 defines a set of strategies that are based on the principles of interdisciplinarity and partnership. These strategies will serve as the platform for our ongoing drive to ensure that, at the beginning of this new millennium, the Organization meets a major challenge: that of combining continuity of purpose with flexibility of approach in a changing world.
I am therefore confident that this document will be viewed by our Members as the blueprint they have set out for the Organization to build upon, by our partners as a statement of FAO's intent to broaden and strengthen mutual links, and by the Secretariat staff - at all levels - as the foundation for a truly corporate approach to our work.

I. Overall strategic framework
Towards 2015
In the year 2015 FAO will celebrate its 70th birthday. What will it be doing then? What should it be doing between now and then? At the turn of the century, and of the millennium, FAO's Members have decided to address these questions through the development of a Strategic Framework to guide the Organization's work over the coming 15 years.
The question of where FAO should be going and what it should be doing by 2015 is inextricably linked to the question of what kind of world it will be part of. In anticipating what the future will hold, the only real certainty is uncertainty. Demographic and economic projections only indicate the likely scenario based on current trends.
According to the latest population projections of the United Nations (UN), the world's population is expected to grow on average by about 75 million per year until 2015, when it is forecast to reach 7.2 billion. Populations living in what is today the developing world will account for over 90 percent of the increase. In 2015, it is estimated that Africa's population will be 55 percent above its 1995 level, while that of the other developing regions combined will be close to one-third above this level.
Economic growth in the medium term (to 2005) is expected to be more sustained in the developing world as a whole than in the developed countries, although with considerable differences between countries. However, change in the global balance of wealth among nations is likely to be slow; at present, 78 percent of world GDP is accounted for by high-income countries, which have 15 percent of the world's population, while only 2.5 percent comes from low-income economies, which have 35 percent of the world's population. Moreover, as recent events leading to regional and global financial instability in 1997/98 demonstrated, there is a risk of economic recessions with consequent adverse effects on employment, agriculture and food security.
Hunger is expected to persist, although at slightly attenuated levels. The number of chronically undernourished people in developing countries is now estimated to be 791 million for the 1995-1997 period. The region with the largest absolute numbers of undernourished (524 million) is Asia, while the region with the largest proportion of its population undernourished (28 percent) is Africa. Unless major efforts are made to improve food supplies and to overcome inequities, in 2015 the incidence of undernourishment in some individual countries may still be as high as 30 percent of the population.
A growing number of the chronically undernourished are likely to be among the urban poor. The world's current population of 6 billion is still predominantly rural. However, the total number of people living in urban areas is expected to increase by more than 60 million per year, and, by 2010, urban areas are expected to have surpassed rural areas in population. By 2015, 26 cities in the world, most of which are in countries now categorized as developing, are expected to have populations of 10 million or more.
National and international action can avert or mitigate the negative consequences of some of these trends, particularly for food security. Political, economic and social systems will be expected to provide the enabling environment necessary to ensure equitable access to food. Agriculture - in the broad definition including fisheries and forestry - will have to meet the needs of growing and increasingly urbanized populations while at the same time protecting the natural resource base for the benefit of future generations.
Within this general scenario, a number of major trends and forces can be considered likely to have a bearing on FAO's future work. They can be summarized as follows:
* Increased emphasis on the state's principal role as that of providing a policy and regulatory framework conducive to sustainable development
* Continuing globalization and liberalization of trade, including food and agricultural trade
* Growth in the number of countries in the middle-income group, and increased reliance on regional and subregional groupings
* Persistence of poverty and mounting inequality - a widening of the gap between the affluent and the poor
* Continued risk of disaster-related and complex emergencies
* Changing demands on agriculture, fisheries and forestry in increasingly urbanized societies
* Changing dietary patterns and increasing public awareness of food (safety and quality) and environmental issues
* Increasing pressure on natural resources and competition for their use
* Steady progress in research and technological development, and continued inequality in access to its benefits
* Increasing impact of information and communications technology on institutions and societies
* Changes in the nature and the composition of funding for agricultural development
* Changing role and public perceptions of the UN system
Each of the trends presents both risks and opportunities for the Organization. A Strategic Framework for FAO's response to the challenges implicit in this scenario must begin with consideration of the Organization's purpose.
Purpose
The fundamental purpose of FAO is set out in the Preamble to the FAO Constitution (Box 1), which affirms the determination of Members "to promote the common welfare by furthering separate and collective action on their part for the purpose of:
* raising levels of nutrition and standards of living of the peoples under their respective jurisdictions;
* securing improvements in the efficiency of the production and distribution of all food and agricultural products;
* bettering the condition of rural populations;
* and thus contributing towards an expanding world economy and ensuring humanity's freedom from hunger".
The order of the elements in the Preamble, and the name given to the Organization, associating food and agriculture, were significant in that they recognized both the imperative of ensuring adequate nutrition and standards of living for all, and the importance of agriculture in doing so. In a report to the first conference - in Quebec City - which established FAO on 16 October 1945, the drafters of the Constitution stated: "If there is one fundamental principle on which FAO is based, it is that the welfare of producers and the welfare of consumers are in the final analysis identical." It was to be the business of FAO to seek and to emphasize the "larger framework" within which the interests of the consumers of food and the interests of agricultural producers were seen to be the same. And, as was made clear in Article I of the Constitution, the term "agriculture" was to be understood in a broad sense, to include fisheries, marine products, forestry and primary forest
products.
That the purpose of FAO remains relevant, vital and valid was reaffirmed at the time of the celebration of FAO's Fiftieth Anniversary in 1995. This was an occasion for both a review of past experience and a look ahead. Two things were clear. The first was that considerable progress had been made in food and agriculture generally and in reducing the proportion of chronically under-nourished in the population of the developing world. The second was that, despite all the progress, the undernourished still amounted to one-fifth of the total, and this in absolute terms meant more than 800 million people without access to enough food to meet their basic requirements.
Box 1
THE FAO CONSTITUTION
The Preamble states:
"The Nations accepting this Constitution, being determined to promote the common welfare by furthering separate and collective action on their part for the purpose of:
* raising levels of nutrition and standards of living of the peoples under their respective jurisdictions;
* securing improvements in the efficiency of the production and distribution of all food and agricultural products;
* bettering the condition of rural populations;
* and thus contributing towards an expanding world economy and ensuring humanity's freedom from hunger;
hereby establish the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, hereinafter referred to as the 'Organization' through which the Members will report to one another on the measures taken and the progress achieved in the field of action set forth above."
Article I defines the mandate of FAO as follows:
1. The Organization shall collect, analyse, interpret and disseminate information relating to nutrition, food and agriculture. In this Constitution, the term "agriculture" and its derivatives include fisheries, marine products, forestry and primary forestry products.
2. The Organization shall promote and, where appropriate, shall recommend national and international action with respect to:
a) scientific, technological, social and economic research relating to nutrition, food and agriculture;
b) the improvement of education and administration relating to nutrition, food and agriculture, and the spread of public knowledge of nutritional and agricultural science and practice;
c) the conservation of natural resources and the adoption of improved methods of agricultural production;
d) the improvement of the processing, marketing and distribution of food and agricultural products;
e) the adoption of policies for the provision of adequate agricultural credit, national and international;
f) the adoption of international policies with respect to agricultural commodity arrangements.
3. It shall also b e the function of the Organization:
a) to furnish such technical assistance as governments may request;
b) to organize, in cooperation with the governments concerned, such missions as may be needed to assist them to fulfil the obligation arising from their acceptance of the recommendations of the United Nations Conference on Food and Agriculture and of this Constitution; and
c) generally to take all necessary and appropriate action to implement the purposes of the Organizations as set forth in the Preamble.
In the Quebec Declaration, approved by the Ministerial Meeting convened in Quebec City, Canada, and subsequently formally adopted by the FAO Conference, Members recalled each of the specific elements of the Preamble and reaffirmed their political support to the Organization in carrying out "its mission to help build a world where all people can live with dignity, confident of food security".
They emphasized the promotion of agriculture, forestry and fisheries as key sectors in the quest for sustainable economic development, the empowerment of food producers and consumers, the sustainable use of natural resources for development and the need to build a global partnership for sustainable development. In its substance, the Quebec Declaration reaffirmed the basic principles on which FAO was founded. It was formulated, however, to reflect changes in perspective based on 50 years of experience and on new paradigms emerging or accepted as a result of that experience.
The new paradigms emerged even more clearly in the outcomes of the series of international conferences and summits convened in the 1990s. These generated a broad-based international consensus on development, as a common response by the international community to the situation at the end of the twentieth century. They drew attention particularly to the need for a concerted attack on poverty and environmental degradation. Still to come, however, was a clearer focus on the imperative of addressing hunger, as the most extreme and unacceptable manifestation of poverty, and on the twin necessities of producing enough food for the people while protecting and sustaining the resources of the planet. It remained for the World Food Summit to build on agreements reached in earlier fora, in order to add the essential dimension of food security to the agenda for action in the twenty-first century.
The World Food Summit - a new point of reference
At the same 1995 session at which it adopted the Quebec Declaration, the FAO Conference decided to convene the World Food Summit. The Summit, held one year later, was the first global gathering at the highest political level to focus solely on food security and, in adopting the Rome Declaration on World Food Security and the World Food Summit Plan of Action, it renewed the commitment of the international community to ensuring food for all. The Declaration enunciates both the ultimate goal and the immediate target: "We pledge our political will and our common and national commitment to achieving food security for all and to an ongoing effort to eradicate hunger in all countries, with an immediate view to reducing the number of undernourished people to half their present level no later than 2015."
A common thread that runs through the declarations and action plans adopted by the global conferences is that of national responsibility and international solidarity. The goals defined are goals that only states can achieve, but the multilateral institutions, each within its own mandate and sphere of competence, are called on to help and support them in that effort.
Thus, FAO has a major role to play in assisting countries in implementing the provisions of the World Food Summit Plan of Action that fall within its mandate, as well as in monitoring, through its Committee on World Food Security (CFS), overall progress in achieving the Summit's goals. In defining FAO's own goals, therefore, the Plan of Action is fundamental.
At the same time, the Organization has significant responsibilities within the UN system for assisting in implementation of parts of Agenda 21, adopted by the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED), and for aspects of the outcome of a number of other UN conferences dealing, inter alia, with women, children, population and social development.
Global goals
Keeping in mind the Basic Texts of FAO, it is possible to define three interrelated global goals that the Organization is specifically dedicated to helping Members achieve:
* Access of all people at all times to sufficient nutritionally adequate and safe food, ensuring that the number of chronically undernourished people is reduced by half by no later than 2015.
* The continued contribution of sustainable agriculture and rural development, including fisheries and forestry, to economic and social progress and the well-being of all.
* The conservation, improvement and sustainable utilization of natural resources, including land, water, forest, fisheries and genetic resources for food and agriculture.
These goals have been formulated taking into account a number of texts agreed at various international conferences, and in particular the World Food Summit and UNCED. It should be stressed that they should not be seen as reopening debates that took place in those fora, nor as encompassing all aspects of the issues discussed in them. Rather, the intention is to highlight those aspects for which a contribution is expected from FAO in view of its mandate and sphere of competence.
In the pursuit of these goals, FAO must rely on a strong set of values that define it as an institution (Box 2). It must also have a clear sense of its mission and a vision of success.
Box 2
VALUES
FAO's field of action touches on the most basic of human rights and needs - that of freedom from hunger - as well as on crucial sectors of the world economy - agriculture, forestry and fisheries.
Certain fundamental values underlie the Constitution, which Members accept on joining the Organization and which are enunciated in the Oath of Office by which the staff of the Secretariat are bound:
* Commitment. With broad global membership, the Organization is dedicated to promoting the common welfare through cooperation among nations; integrity and devotion to this ideal are required of those who serve in the Secretariat.
* Independence. FAO provides a forum in which Members seek to broaden consensus, and an impartial Secretariat is key to assisting them in achieving this.
* Partnerships. FAO belongs to a global family of institutions in the UN system dedicated to the promotion of international economic and social cooperation and brought into relationship with the UN itself under the provision of Article 57 of the Charter, and its staff belong to an International Civil Service that is loyal to common principles.
* Competence. FAO is expected to be a centre of excellence in its field, with a Secretariat dedicated to securing the highest standards of efficiency and technical competence.
* Equality. FAO is committed to the promotion of the full and equal participation of women in development and to the achievement of gender balance in the staff of the Secretariat.
* Diversity. FAO's strength derives from, among other things, respect for diverse approaches and paths to a common destination; its Secretariat therefore recruits personnel on as wide a geographical basis as possible.
* Unity. By coming together in the Organization, nations affirm their belief in the need for collective action and their willingness to take it, and the Secretariat accepts loyally to carry out the decisions of Members.
Mission
FAO's mission, in fulfilment of the purpose for which it was established (Preamble to the Constitution) and in full respect of its mandate (Article 1 of the Constitution), is to help build a food-secure world for present and future generations.
In the coming 15 years FAO will assist Members in: reducing food insecurity and rural poverty; ensuring an enabling policy and regulatory framework for food and agriculture, fisheries and forestry; securing sustainable increases in the supply and availability of food; conserving and enhancing the natural resource base; and generating knowledge of food and agriculture, fisheries and forestry.
Vision
The Organization's vision of success is to remain fully responsive to the ideals and requirements of its Members, and to be recognized for leadership and partnership in helping to build a food-secure world.
In the coming 15 years it will be: a centre of excellence and an authoritative purveyor of knowledge and advice in the sphere of its mandate; a pre-eminent repository and provider of multidisciplinary capacities and services in the areas of its competence; an active partner of organizations, within and also outside the UN system, that share its goals and values; a well-managed, efficient and cost-effective institution; a mobilizer of international will and resources to assist its Members, as well as a responsible manager of the resources entrusted to it; and an effective communicator and advocate for its own goals and those of its Members.
Part II of this document addresses the ways in which FAO will translate this overall strategic orientation into concrete strategies for action. It highlights the challenge facing the Organization, which is to combine continuity of purpose with flexibility of approach in a changing world.

II. Corporate strategies
The corporate strategies that make up the Strategic Framework include both strategies to address Members' needs and strategies to address cross-organizational issues. The former cover what FAO will do to help Members achieve their goals, while the latter deal with the way in which it will carry out its tasks.
Both sets of strategies require consideration of the means of action at the Organization's disposal. These may be roughly grouped into "normative" and "operational", including technical cooperation, activities. However, there is often no rigid demarcation between them because of the synergies inherent in a multidisciplinary programme executed through a decentralized structure.
FAO's Regular Programme is the basis and starting-point for formulation of the Strategic Framework. The strategies to address Members' needs are rooted in normative work, complemented by operational activities, requested by member countries, maintaining an appropriate balance between the two.
The Regular Programme will continue to provide inputs for operational work, notably through the Special Programme for Food Security (SPFS) and the Technical Cooperation Programme (TCP). Nevertheless, the bulk of funding will have to come, as in the past, from extrabudgetary sources. Measures to enhance the effectiveness of the Organization's technical cooperation activities, and to leverage resources for them, are dealt with in the strategies to address cross-organizational issues.
Strategies to address Members' needs
Two basic principles underlie the approach taken in formulating the following five corporate strategies and related strategic objectives:
* interdisciplinarity, to address multisectoral issues through the mobilization of contributions from all relevant disciplines within the Organization, and
* partnership, both among FAO units - at headquarters and in the decentralized offices - and with governments, other organizations (UN and non-UN) and civil society.
The purpose of these corporate strategies is to give clearer focus and direction to the Organization's work in serving its Members, concentrating on the areas in which it has comparative advantages. The assumption underlying the definition of the strategic objectives is that their achievement will depend on the action of member countries as well as on that of FAO. While the Strategic Framework is "resource-neutral", the amount and type of resources made available will be major determinants of success.
Although the strategic orientation of the Organization's work between the years 2000 and 2015 requires interdisciplinary programmes, it does not preclude the formulation of sectoral strategic plans, such as FAO's Strategic Plan for Forestry. The global goals referred to in Part I of this document will continue to have sectoral thematic goals contributing to them and, in many cases, specific plans or programmes of action agreed by countries. Examples include the Kyoto Declaration and Plan of Action on the Sustainable Contribution of Fisheries to Food Security, the Leipzig Declaration and Global Plan of Action for the Conservation and Sustainable Utilization of Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture. Cross-cutting thematic goals and plans, such as the FAO Plan of Action for Women in Development, will also continue to guide FAO's approach
A- Contributing to the eradication of food insecurity and rural poverty
If the global target set by the World Food Summit is to be met, special efforts will have to be made by and on behalf of those countries where the problems are greatest. Generally, these countries are characterized by: widespread poverty, mainly in rural areas; low growth of per caput food production; low and variable per caput food availability; and uneven access to available food. The group also includes countries vulnerable to, or suffering the effects of, natural disasters and humanitarian crises, which are important causes of food insecurity.
This corporate strategy addresses key factors that contribute to certain preoccupying trends in the external environment - the persistence of poverty, the widening of the gap between the affluent and the poor, the inequality in access to the benefits of economic and technological progress, and the continued risk of disaster-related and complex emergencies. Normative means of action will include identification and dissemination of policy and decision support tools, guidelines and information on best practices, and capacity building for both public and non-governmental sectors. In its technical cooperation with member countries, FAO will focus on actions that are both urgent and appropriate in the light of its mandate and comparative advantage. In the response to emergencies, for example, support for aid coordination and planning of rehabilitation in the agricultural sector may be expected to assume increasing importance.
A.1 Sustainable rural livelihoods and more equitable access to resources
Poverty is a major cause of food insecurity. Efforts to increase food supplies and accelerate economic growth will bring overall benefits to the country and society but, unless accompanied by complementary targeted measures, they are unlikely to completely eliminate poverty and food insecurity among rural populations. People living in economically and environmentally marginal areas are at the greatest risk of being left behind, but poverty and food insecurity also exist among the resource-poor in more favourably endowed areas.
More sustainable livelihoods and food security can be ensured for these populations only through efforts to increase individuals' opportunities and choices and improve resource productivity, thereby resulting in higher rural incomes and improved access to food. The promotion of equitable access to natural and economic resources and social services is crucial and may require specific action to address gender disparities. The challenge is to improve rural livelihoods, farm incomes and food security, both in food-deficit and economically marginal areas and among the resource-poor in more favourably endowed areas.
Strategy components
The components include:
* improving the opportunities available to the rural poor to strengthen, diversify and sustain their livelihoods by taking advantage of the potential synergies between farming, fishing, forestry and animal husbandry, including through pre- and post-production income-generating enterprises (e.g. through the TCP and the SPFS);
* supporting efforts to strengthen local institutions and to enact policies and legislation that will provide for more equitable access by both women and men to natural resources (particularly land, water, fisheries and forest) and related economic and social resources;
* improving the efficiency and effectiveness by which the public and private sectors respond to the multiple and differing needs of disadvantaged rural populations, notably of women and youth;
* promoting gender-sensitive, participatory and sustainable strategies and approaches, based on self-help, capacity building and empowerment, to improve the skills of the rural poor and local, civil society and rural people's organizations; and
* assisting in the targeting of investment in the agricultural, fisheries and forestry sectors - from public and private, domestic and international sources - that contributes to food security and poverty eradication.
Comparative advantages and partnerships
In the sphere of integrated rural development, FAO has competence in major areas (food and nutrition, crops, livestock, fisheries and forestry) that are basic to improving rural incomes and employment opportunities. It is the only international agency that deals with all aspects of rural land tenure. It has developed specific capabilities for capacity building and institutional strengthening, developing and applying participatory processes and methods to help the rural poor capture available opportunities and have access to the necessary resources. Particularly innovative approaches have been developed, through the SPFS, for the identification of constraints and the testing, demonstration and replication of strategies for rural livelihood improvements. FAO also has proven expertise in mobilizing investment in the agricultural, fisheries and forestry sectors.
Considering that poverty eradication is a major goal of Members, and that it has stimulated a UN system-wide response, FAO's contributions focused on the rural sector are not provided in isolation but are an integral part of the broader effort. Critical to the attainment of better rural living standards will be investment in improved access to safe water and sanitation, power supplies, health services and education. From this vantage point, FAO will seek further integration of its action within the UN system (notably with WFP, IFAD, WHO, ILO, UNESCO, UNICEF, UNDP, UNFPA, UNEP, UNDCP and UNIFEM). The ACC Network on Rural Development and Food Security will be an important means to promote this at both the headquarters and field levels. Partnerships will also be reinforced with the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) system and academic and national research institutions. New alliances, based on shared objectives and complementarity of action,
will be sought with organizations operating in the sphere of rural development and poverty alleviation, including specialized non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and community-based organizations (particularly those of farmers, rural people, women and youth), as well as with the private sector. Building on the longstanding cooperation with the World Bank, regional development banks and IFAD, attempts will be made to stimulate increased official development assistance (ODA) flows in support of food security.
A.2 Access of vulnerable and disadvantaged groups to sufficient, safe and nutritionally adequate food
While poverty eradication should theoretically result in food security for all, there are compelling reasons for focusing directly and immediately on addressing undernourishment and malnutrition. Inadequate dietary intake that persists over time poses a serious threat to health, prevents normal growth and development in children, reduces mental capacity and lowers productivity of able-bodied adults, thereby contributing significantly to the conditions that prevent individuals from moving out of poverty. Meeting the World Food Summit target implies that countries will need to adopt special measures aimed directly at achieving and sustaining nutritional improvements among the poor and socially disadvantaged. Failure to do so will result in large segments of their populations passing their entire lives underfed and malnourished and unable either to contribute to, or benefit fully from, the development process.
The challenge for countries affected by widespread undernourishment, and for FAO in its efforts to assist them, is to address this need in an era of diminished state intervention and to obtain, allocate and administer resources for "safety nets" and related programmes that ensure access to sufficient, safe and nutritionally adequate food in both urban and rural areas. In this regard, progress made in further developing a rights-based approach to food security would be taken into full account. There is an immediate need to identify more clearly who the food-inse
