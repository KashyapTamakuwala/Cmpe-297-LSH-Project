Introduction There has always been a keen interest in policy formulation and how forest and natural resources policies respond to the needs of the sector in terms of assessment and monitoring. Since 1987, more than 70 policies (departmental administrative orders, memorandum circulars, special orders) have been issued in the forestry sector alone. This does not include national legislation relating to the Clean Air Act, Indigenous People's Rights Act, National Integrated Protected Areas Act, Mining Act and others. Legislation on sustainable forest management and a national land-use policy are under preparation. The Forestry Code of the Philippines (Presidential Decree 705) will be amended. The master plan for the Philippine environment and natural resources is being reviewed and some sections are being revised. A policy is only as good as the information on which it is based. Good policies are able to respond to the needs of the sector and are able to adjust accordingly. That is why the aggregation of data from the field offices to the policy-making office is so vital in the formulation of responsive policies. There must be a conscious, deliberate and institutionalized link between data collection, the generation of information and policy formulation. This study evaluated such a link including the flow of forest and natural resources data and information; the report is organized according to the objectives listed below. The subsequent sections contain a discussion of the objectives and the extent to which these were addressed within the constraints and limitations of the study. The primary objective of the study was to prescribe the most cost-efficient and cost-effective methodology for data transfer and information flow. The specific objectives were to: Assess the type, quality and amount of data and information being collected at the Community Environment and Natural Resource Office (CENRO) level of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR); Evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of data transfer and information flow at environment and natural resources offices (ENROs) from the community ENROs to the provincial ENROs to the regional ENROs and ultimately to the DENR central office; Analyze the gaps in data transfer and information flow; Evaluate the data gathered in terms of attribute data and spatial information as an indication of GIS-readiness; Develop a strategy and methodologies for filling data gaps and for improving the flow of information; and Provide an indicative analysis on the quality of policy formulation as determined by the type, quality and amount of data and information. The study evaluated the data and information flow within the operational mechanism of the DENR. It has two major outputs: methodology for data transfer and information flow for forest and natural resources; and analysis of attribute data and spatial information as indicators of readiness for GIS implementation. Rationale The Government of the Philippines has formulated a comprehensive collection of policies on forestry, environment and natural resources. It is quick to respond to policy needs and as a result, policies embracing and addressing specific issues and problems are drafted. However, this swift response to needs is not necessarily translated into solutions at the ground level and there is a considerable number of overlapping policies. In addition, policies are not implemented based on the performance of the country's forest management sector as required. Over four centuries, the Philippine forestry situation has deteriorated to a situation where the country has become a net importer of timber. From an estimated 27.5 million ha of forest in 1575 (Revilla et al. 2000), the total forest cover (including plantations) has declined to about 6.5 million ha (FAO 2001). Per.
capita forest cover in the Philippines is estimated at 0.072 ha. This is 23 times lower than the average for the Asia-Pacific region (Revilla et al. 2000). The Philippine constitution mandates that forestlands and national parks, including their boundaries shall be marked clearly on the ground. Such forestlands (including national parks) shall be conserved and may not be increased nor diminished, except by law. On this basis, land classification at the national level divides the country into two categories: forestlands and alienable and disposable lands (A&D lands). The classification is based primarily on slope, which assumes that agricultural productivity diminishes in steeper areas. Here, agricultural productivity is defined in terms of the susceptibility of the land to erosion and soil degradation. Areas with slopes of 18 percent or more are not deemed suitable for long-term agricultural production and are classified as forestlands. Areas with slopes less than 18 percent are classified as A&D lands. Of the 30 million ha that comprise the total land area of the country, it is estimated that 53 percent (or 15.88 million ha) belongs to forestlands while the remainder are A&D lands. The irony is that while the policy on land classification has been in place for the past 80 years, the boundaries that separate the forestlands from the A&D lands are not marked on the ground. As a result, human intrusion has proliferated over the years to the extent that citizens have privatized areas that should remain as forestlands. Agriculture and livestock raising occur on certain parts of forestlands. All too often, these are critical watersheds ­ areas so degraded that forest renewal is a priority and must be the only activity. Only recently has the government undertaken a massive effort to delineate and demarcate the boundaries on the ground. According to the 2000 census, the estimated population was 76.5 million. About 26 percent is living in and dependent on the uplands for their livelihoods. Their contribution to forest degradation along with rampant illegal logging and ineffective forest renewal has contributed to the destruction of much of the country's forests. Primary or old growth forest is estimated at only 800 000 ha (see Table 1).

Methodology Data flow diagram approach This study made use of the data flow diagram (DFD) approach following the three most important components of data and information management for the environment and natural resources (ENR) ­ processes, files and flow (see Figure 1). Processes show what systems do. Each process has one or more data inputs and produces one or more outputs. Each process has a unique name and number (Hawryszkiewycz 1994). On the other hand, a file is a repository and contains data that are retained in the system. It refers to a data store and each file contains important data that are transported accordingly between processes and external entities. "Flows" model the passage of data in the system between processes, between a data store and a process, from a source to a sink, or from a process to a sink.
Processes reside within the system boundaries. Those that are outside its boundaries, but are important to the functioning of the system, are called external entities. These are usually beyond the control of the system but are referred to as either sources or sinks. Sources are external entities that supply data to the system while sinks are those that use the data. Processes and files are visualized using a DFD. A DFD shows how data flow within a system. DFDs may be established at different levels of an organization; depending on the requirements of the task, more details can be added to the diagram. For example, a contextual DFD may appear as shown in Figure.
As mentioned earlier, DFDs may be drawn in more detail depending on the requirements of the analysis. Figure 2 shows that an Integrated Forest Management Agreement (IFMA) system may be sub-divided further into its component sub-systems. These components may refer to the following processes: species-site identification, ground validation, IFMA preparation and proposal, monitoring and evaluation. The input and output files are shown by the corresponding arrows which also indicate the flow of data.

Primary data gathering through field visits A combination of primary and secondary data was used in the analysis. Primary data were gathered using an interview schedule that had the following components (see Appendix 1 ­ Survey Guide Questionnaire): duties and responsibilities within the organization vision/mission/objectives of the organization key result areas or priority areas of the office data collected and survey instruments used types of report that the central office requires including · originator of the report · when and where the reports are submitted · frequency of report preparation/submission · manner in which reports are submitted database maintenance problems encountered in terms of data and information management access of other agencies/offices/institutions to the data and information briefings/refresher and training courses conducted for the technical employees of the office Interviews were conducted with officials concerned at the different levels of the organization. Those interviewed at the study sites had a wide range of responsibilities and positions ­ especially the community, provincial and regional ENR officers; they included planning officers and staff from different units such as the timber management unit, the forest protection unit, the reforestation unit, community-based forest management (CBFM), and the protected areas and wildlife service (PAWS) unit. Planning officers at the different offices, including the central office, were also interviewed. A list of those interviewed and their assignments and positions is given in Appendix.
Primary data gathering via a workshop Initial results from field visits and interviews were analyzed at a three-day workshop attended by representatives from six regions and the central office (see Appendix 2). The number of workshop participants was restricted to maximize discussions and interaction. The participants represented various levels of the decision-making hierarchy ­ regional, provincial and community ENR officers, and planning officers, including the director of the Forest Management Bureau (FMB). The workshop was designed to elicit current practices in terms of data gathering and reporting procedures. The workshop was divided into three modules representing processes, files and flow. For each module, guiding questions were distributed and a plenary session was conducted for presentations. Some of the guiding issues or questions that were tackled during the workshop are listed below. Module 1: Processes This referred to the DENR policy and implementing rules and regulations on forest and natural resources. Guiding questions included: What are the responsibilities; accountabilities of each responsible office/unit? What, if any, are the conflicts in terms of responsibilities? Do assignments/reassignments of personnel occur? What is the reporting procedure? Is there an aggregation and disaggregation of data and information from the field offices to the higher levels of management and vice versa?.
Module 2: Files This referred to data and information being surveyed/collected/monitored. Some of the guiding questions included: What are the key result areas or priority activities in your area of jurisdiction? Is there a minimum dataset on ENR that must be generated? What is the format of the reports? Is there a central repository of files in the region, province or community ENR office? Other issues: survey instruments, maps, accuracy/precision standards, data maintenance. Module 3: Flow This referred to the direction of files along the processes concerned. Some guiding questions were: What are the lines of communication in terms of reporting? What is the reporting procedure? What is the frequency of reporting? What is the general route of reports? The DENR divides the country administratively into 16 regions consistent with the political subdivisions of the country. Each region is further sub-divided into districts, provinces, municipalities, barangays (villages) and sitios (hamlets). Two regions namely Cagayan Valley and Caraga were chosen as sample sites. The primary considerations in the choice of the study sites were relative abundance of forest cover, socio-economic setting and accessibility. The first study site is located in the northern part of the country while the second is in the south. Both sites are accessible by land and air. Table 2 shows the forest cover for all regions of the country based on estimates from SPOT imageries by the National Mapping and Resources Information Authority (NAMRIA). On a regional basis, Caraga Region ranks first in terms of forest cover followed by Cagayan Valley.

The study sites are found in the least dense regions of the country with populations exceeding 2.8 million and 2 million in Cagayan Valley and Caraga, respectively. The highest reported population is in Southern Tagalog and the lowest is in the Cordilleras. The average population growth rate from 1990 to 2000 has been steady at 1.73 percent for Caraga and 1.87 percent for Cagayan Valley. Southern Tagalog is the fastest growing region with an average growth rate of 3.62 percent for the same period. In terms of regional accounts, the combined agriculture, fishery and forestry sectors sustained growth of 3.7 percent in 2001 with the highest amounting to Php35.3 million in Southern Tagalog and the lowest in the Cordillera Administrative Region at Php3.5 million. Cagayan Valley and Caraga posted Php11.7 million and Php5.1 million, respectively. The figures for the study sites were slightly higher than the previous year (2000). The gross regional domestic product for 2001 was 2.7 percent and 1.5 percent for Cagayan Valley and Caraga, respectively. Interestingly, the highest was registered in Northern Mindanao at 5 percent while the lowest was posted in Western Mindanao at 0.6 percent. Forest cover was the primary consideration in choosing the study sites. The extent of forested area indicates activities related to forestry. Caraga and Cagayan Valley represent the last forest bastions in the Philippines including Southern Tagalog. More recently, these regions have been identified as biodiversity hotspots, both locally and internationally. They are considered vital corridors for biodiversity conservation. The study sites belong to the least densely populated regions of the country. With 26 percent of the population living in the uplands, social forestry in these regions fares better relative to other regions.
Results and discussion Each ENR office was studied in terms of activities on data gathering, organizing, input and maintenance. The type, quality and amount (including location and extent) of data collected were noted through interviews with personnel. Data transfer and information flow from the CENRO was evaluated as these are transmitted to the PENRO; from PENRO to the regional office; from the regional office to the central office and vice versa. Evaluating the type, quality and amount of data and information collected Files refer to data and information that are gathered and kept at the respective unit/office. Once these files are sent out in compliance with a directive or following a procedure, they become reports. In other words, reports are received and sent out and when they are archived they become files. The data and information collected at the CENRO level are shown in Table 4.
Data and information at the CENRO level Data and information Inventory of private tree plantations Survey of plantation status (including residual inventory) Private geodetic survey Forestland grazing lease agreement (FLGLA) data Price monitoring List of licensees/permittees List of reforestation projects List of people's organization/ cooperative partnerships Reports Report on issuances of forestry tenurial instruments (e.g. CBFM) Confiscation/disposition report Log production and disposition Lumber production/disposition Land report Reforestation report Forest production report Biodiversity monitoring system report ENR profile Sectoral monthly accomplishment report (quarterly, semi-annual, annual) Annual report.
Data collected by CENROs differ from those of PENROs, which collate the data gathered by the CENROs. Its main function is supervisory and it compiles the reports/data/information from the different CENROs under it. Local information is available only at the CENRO level. The central office outlines the programs and activities of the CENROs. For instance, if the CENRO plans to implement activities on maintenance (e.g. timber stand improvement) but the central office intends to carry out roadside planting, adjustments at the CENRO level need to be made specifically in relation to human resources and logistics. That is, CENROs have to adjust their budget because additional funds for roadside planting are not included in their annual budget. In the study, CENROs reported problems in data consolidation. Sometimes data are inadvertently excluded during consolidation. Maps are also used as references. They are drawn by hand and to date no training on computerized mapmaking (i.e. CAD or GIS) has been conducted. Private tree plantation owners and timber license agreement holders are required to submit operational, logging and development maps. Maps are reproduced by blue printing or by requesting hard copies from an independent or non-government office. PENROs and CENROs may request hard copies of maps from the regional office. Maps are also used as supporting documents for complaints on illegal activities to be filed in court. The types of data collected and stored at the PENRO are listed in Table 5.

For data maintenance, some DENR field offices reconstitute/reconstruct maps on tracing paper that bear the recording officer's signature. They also catalogue reports/records in filing cabinets and computers, if available. A list of data and information held at the Regional Environment and Natural Resources Office (RENRO) is provided in Table 6.

PENRO sectoral and annual reports W atershed profiles Survey reports Regular reports such as monthly accomplishments, quarterly, semi-annual, annual reports Statistical reports such as ENR statistical profile, quarterly/annual statistical profile and regional profile.
The DENR field offices prepare the following reports regularly: monthly accomplishments, quarterly, semi-annual, and annual reports (see Figure 3). These reports are prepared on the basis of the data and information that are gathered by the respective ENR offices be they community, provincial or regional. Report submission at the CENRO level occurs at the beginning of the month, the fifteenth of the month, quarterly and by semester. At the PENRO level, CENRO reports are reviewed and consolidated before they are submitted to the regional office on the twentieth of the month. At the end of each month, the regional office submits a consolidated report from all PENROs to the central office. Gaps in data transfer and information flow Reports are submitted via fax, courier, radio, telephone, and e-mail or by hand. Reports are kept in the record section, if there is one. In retrieving files, the record section officer is delegated as the property custodian, but as the need arises, other employees also help. Logbooks are kept for receiving and releasing communications and reports.
In the forestry sector, the community-based forest management information system (CBFMIS) and forest stock monitoring system (FSMS) are used, although the FSMS has not been implemented widely yet owing to a lack of computers. Even if a computer is available, some staff are not familiar with the use of CBFMIS and FSMS. CENROs hold refresher courses and briefings or training for their staff. Training is either hosted by the regional office, PENRO or CENRO. Staff are reoriented on their regular functions and updated on other aspects of their duties. Staff are also briefed on special projects. Through special orders, a forest ranger can be transferred as a log scaler. In such situations, the CENRO implements rescheduling and personnel adjustments to avoid total cessation of their regular functions. Field "truthing" and data discrepancy are also addressed. For example, the data of a particular area submitted to the regional office describe it as forestland but upon field validation the area is discovered to have been converted to a kaingin (slash-and-burn) area. The regional office conducts field validation, and if there are inconsistencies in the data, they return the information to the field office for revalidation. In general, however, there is no standard procedure for data collection, retrieval and overall management. A specific figure, for example on plantation status, may appear in several reports, which makes retrieval and updating a tedious process. Within the context of the existing reporting system, there appear to be no gaps because the reporting system is followed studiously. The problem, for instance, in generating a forecast based on what has been reported, may not lie in the contents of the report, but the data-generation instruments themselves. Attribute data and spatial information as an indication of GIS readiness In the Caraga Regional Office, a GIS database is available in ArcView® format (e.g. shapefiles of municipal roads; national roads; provincial roads; coastlines; rivers/creeks; regional boundaries; provincial boundaries; municipal boundaries; lakes; provinces of Caraga; Caraga Region). Unfortunately, there is no computer specialist for GIS databasing which makes the data vulnerable to corruption and loss. GIS data structures and analytical techniques are being incorporated gradually, however. Although some GIS encoding is pursued through georeferencing of important GPS points, its use is primarily for cartographic presentations. Despite its availability, GIS use lacks analytical form mainly for the following reasons: Lack of understanding on the basic concepts and principles of GIS; No training for personnel; The organization finds it prohibitive to establish a GIS system; Lack of institutional strengthening that integrates GIS within the DENR Usually, GIS processing is contracted out to GIS companies. Unfortunately, the GIS service provided is limited by the requirements imposed by the client organization ­ requirements that are essentially cartographic in nature. In addition, the reports submitted are in paper form and do not permit further analysis. Even if digital files are submitted, the maps are not in GIS format. Improving the flow of information Occasionally the regional office requests a report/data/information from the PENRO but the PENRO passes the retrieval of files to the CENRO, even when the PENRO has its own copy. This problem arises because of the lack of a standard data management system. A system has to be introduced that systematizes data and information collection, retrieval, updating and reporting. Even on a manual basis, if such a system is in place, files and reports can be accessed easily and data duplication and waste of time can be avoided. The importance of a computer-based system similar to CBFMIS or FSMS cannot be overemphasized. Such a system that imposes protocols for.
data and information handling will facilitate work for everyone. At the same time, the flow of information as outlined in Figure 3 can run smoothly.

Quality of policy formulation The current practice for data and information handling makes it difficult to monitor the important activities of the ENR offices. The implementing rules and regulations (IRR) that are based on policies have to be improved, being cognizant of the local situation. Different CENROs have different problems and situations. There are policies applicable in one CENRO that are not applicable in other CENROs. CENROs should set
