1. INTRODUCTION
A Joint Meeting of the FAO Panel of Experts on Pesticide Residues in Food and the Environment and the WHO Core Assessment Group (JMPR) was held in Rome, Italy, from 16 to 25 September 1996. The FAO Panel of Experts had met in preparatory sessions on 11-14 September.
The Meeting was opened by Dr. A. Sawadogo, Assistant Director-General of FAO, and Dr. F. Riveros, Chief of the Crop and Grassland Service of FAO, on behalf of the Directors-General of FAO and WHO.
The opening address recalled that maximum residue limits for pesticide residues in food were recommended for the first time by the Joint FAO/WHO Meeting on Pesticide Residues thirty years ago, and noted a number of salient features of the development of the work of the Joint Meeting since that time.
In the context of current work, the importance of the recent development of methods for estimating more accurately the dietary intake of pesticide residues was stressed. These methods were being applied by the Joint Meeting to facilitate and improve the annual calculations of dietary intakes undertaken by WHO.
A further important aspect of the application of pesticides was the possible risk to the environment from their use. This had been recognized by the inclusion in the Joint Meeting held in Geneva last year of the Environmental Core Assessment Group. Further elaboration of the principle of joint assessment by this Group and the FAO Panel should be encouraged and it was to be hoped that every effort would be made to hold Joint Meetings of all three groups, the Toxicological and Environmental Core Assessment Groups and the FAO Panel, in the future.
The Meeting was held in pursuance of recommendations made by previous Meetings and accepted by the governing bodies of FAO and WHO that studies should be undertaken jointly by experts to evaluate possible hazards to man arising from the occurrence of residues of pesticides in foods. The reports of previous Joint Meetings (see References, Section 7) contain information on acceptable daily intakes (ADIs), maximum residue limits (MRLs) and general principles for the evaluation of the various pesticides. The supporting documents (Residue and Toxicological Evaluations) contain detailed monographs on these pesticides and include comments on analytical methods. The present Meeting was convened to consider a further number of pesticides together with items of a general or a specific nature. These include items for clarification of recommendations made at previous Meetings or for reconsideration of previous evaluations in the light of findings of subsequent research or other
developments.
During the Meeting the FAO Panel of Experts was responsible for reviewing residue and analytical aspects of the pesticides considered, including data on their metabolism, fate in the environment, and use patterns, and for estimating the maximum residue levels that might occur as a result of the use of the pesticides according to good agricultural practices. The WHO Toxicological Core Assessment Group was responsible for reviewing toxicological and related data and for estimating, where possible, ADIs for humans of the pesticides. The recommendations of the Joint Meeting, including those for further research and the provision of additional information, are proposed for use by national governments, international organizations and other interested parties.
The Joint Meeting was saddened to hear of the recent deaths of two former Members of the WHO Expert Group, Professor W. Almeida, University of Campinas, Campinas, São Paulo, and Professor U.G. Ahlborg, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm. Both made significant contributions to the science of toxicology and to the work of the JMPR, which are gratefully acknowledged. They will be missed.

2.2.1 Revised guidelines for predicting the dietary intake of pesticide residues
The WHO Secretariat reviewed the development of methods for predicting the dietary intake of pesticide residues. The revision of existing guidelines (WHO, 1989) was the subject of an FAO/WHO Consultation held 2-6 May 1995 in York, United Kingdom. The report of that Consultation (WHO/FNU/FOS/95.11) contained recommendations for improving estimates of dietary intake, most notably the use of supervised trials median residue (STMR) levels in lieu of MRLs in the calculation of International Estimated Daily Intakes (IEDIs). The Consultation also recommended a method for assessing acute hazards posed by the consumption of large portions of food containing pesticide residues. The report was considered at the twenty-eighth Session of the CCPR, which agreed (ALINORM 97/24, para 23) that the draft revised guidelines be included on the agenda for their Session in 1997. The draft revised guidelines will be available in English, French and Spanish to governments before that time.
The WHO Secretariat provided a draft of the revised guidelines to the JMPR and requested comment on the inclusion of the National Theoretical Maximum Daily Intakes (TMDIs), which parallel the international intake assessments. The Meeting agreed that, conceptually, this would be useful, particularly for developing countries; however, it also emphasized that when information was available a best estimate of intake should be derived, using the IEDI method. The Meeting endorsed the report of the York Consultation and noted that many of the recommendations had already been implemented by the JMPR.
The Meeting was also informed of the report of an FAO Panel Workshop held in The Hague in April 1996, where integration of the recommendations of the York Consultation into the work of the JMPR was discussed. Further details of the recommendations of the Workshop are given in Section 2.2.3.
The WHO Secretariat also reported on planning for a Joint FAO/WHO Consultation on Food Consumption and Exposure Assessment of Chemicals, which will be held 10-14 February 1997 at WHO Headquarters in Geneva. The Consultation will follow up certain recommendations of the York Consultation, particularly in the development of regional diets and in addressing issues related to implementation of the recommendation on intake assessment for acute hazards. In addition, the Consultation will consider approaches for extending the methods used for assessing the intake of pesticides to other chemicals considered by Codex, including food additives, contaminants, veterinary drug residues, and nutrients.
2.2.2 Calculation of dietary intake of pesticide residues
TMDIs were calculated for the JMPR by WHO (GEMS/Food) using the methods described in Guidelines for predicting dietary intake of pesticide residues (WHO, 1989), as revised by the recommendations of the York Consultation. When information was available IEDIs were also calculated. The results are summarized in Annex III and will be made available to the 29th Session of the CCPR in April 1997.
The JMPR has established acute reference doses for eight pesticides. While the York Consultation recommended a simple method for assessing short-term intake to compare with acute reference doses, the data and policy decisions that would allow such calculations require further clarification. The Meeting noted that the topic would be discussed at the Joint FAO/WHO Consultation on Food Consumption and Exposure Assessment of Chemicals to be held in February 1997 in Geneva and looked forward to receiving the recommendations of that Consultation.
The Meeting noted that the risk assessment of acutely toxic pesticides required further refinement and invited governments to make available relevant information on national approaches. The Meeting agreed that, when appropriate, the risk assessment of acute hazards should take into account any variability in the individual units in composite samples on which the MRL is based.
2.2.3 Estimation of supervised trials median residue levels
1. The main objectives of the Joint FAO/WHO Consultation on Guidelines for predicting the Dietary Intake of Pesticide Residues, held in York, United Kingdom, 2-6 May 1995, were to review the existing guidelines and to recommend feasible approaches for improving the reliability and accuracy of methods for predicting the dietary intake of pesticide residues. The final published report of this Consultation became available in February 1996.
2. An informal Workshop was convened in The Hague, Netherlands, 11-12 April 1996, at the request of FAO Panel members, to consider the consequences of the recommendations of the York Consultation for individual reviewers and for the JMPR, and to convert the recommendations into practical methods for evaluating data.
3. The Workshop focused on the reviews of data undertaken by FAO Panel members and the estimation of supervised trials median residue (STMR) levels. Several general recommendations and 27 specific recommendations for the evaluation of data were made.
4. The present Meeting recognized that as pesticides are used in a wide variety of situations methods for evaluating data must be developed to take into account cases that are not already covered by the suggested procedures. The Meeting considered the report of the Workshop and agreed to support its recommendations, while recognizing that data evaluation is evolving. Most of the recommendations have already been implemented in the work of the FAO Panel.
5. On the basis of practical examples, the Meeting concluded that the recommendations on acute dietary intake and ectoparasite treatments of farm animals might require further development. In addition, the Meeting agreed that the recommendation on the estimation of STMRs and MRLs in animal commodities arising from residues in feed required further consideration. The Meeting agreed that examples and more specific guidance in this area should be developed at the 1997 JMPR.
6. The Meeting agreed that STMR levels that had already been estimated should be used by the JMPR in estimating consumer intakes resulting from long-term dietary exposure. The need for more realistic estimates of the dietary intake of pesticide residues was pointed out in the opening address to the Meeting.
7. Methods for presenting estimated STMR levels are still being developed. The aim is to communicate the results as clearly and unambiguously as possible; experience may indicate that further changes are necessary.
8. A copy of the report of the Workshop (Report of an informal workshop on data evaluation in the estimation of dietary intake of pesticide residues for the JMPR) is included as Annex IV to this report. The Meeting agreed that wide availability of the report of the Workshop would improve the transparency of the JMPR evaluation process and would also provide guidance to national governments.
9. The Meeting recommended that both the general and the specific recommendations of the Workshop be included in future FAO and WHO guidelines.
2.2.4 Example of STMR estimation: Parathion-methyl
The 28th Session of the CCPR (ALINORM 97/24, para 46) welcomed the proposal that a fully worked example of intake assessment, prepared by the Codex Secretariat, be presented to the next Session. At the request of the CCPR, the Meeting considered the worked example of parathion-methyl (Parathion-methyl, Estimation of Dietary Intake), which demonstrates the methods used for estimating STMR levels. The STMR levels were combined with information on cultural diets in order to estimate chronic dietary intakes. The example was based on the methods recommended at the Workshop in The Hague, April 1996 (see Section 2.2.3 and Annex IV) and the Meeting confirmed that it reflected the methods used by the FAO Panel at the current Meeting. The Meeting recommended that the example be forwarded to the 1997 Session of the CCPR.
2.3 Relationship between Codex Maximum Residue Limits (MRLs) for pesticide residues, good agricultural practice (GAP), and food safety
The World Trade Organization (WTO) agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures brought the Codex MRLs for pesticides to the attention of a wide range of government officials and representatives of non-governmental organizations. The questions and comments raised during various discussions indicated that the relationship between Codex MRLs for pesticide residues and the safety of food was not always clear. In order to assist the uniform, correct interpretation of the role and the use of MRLs for pesticide residues in food, the Meeting was requested to clarify the matter.
The 'Codex maximum residue limit for pesticide residues' is the maximum concentration of a pesticide residue (expressed as mg/kg) recommended by the Codex Alimentarius Commission to be legally permitted in or on food commodities and animal feeds. MRLs are based on data from trials conducted according to GAP and foods derived from commodities that comply with the respective MRLs are considered to be toxicologically acceptable (Codex Alimentarius Commission procedural manual, 9th ed. p.61.)
Codex standards, one of which is the MRL for pesticide residues, aim to protect the health of consumers and ensure fair practices in food trade.
The Codex MRLs for pesticide residues are elaborated by the Codex Committee on Pesticide Residues on the basis of the advice of the JMPR, which scientifically evaluates all relevant information on pesticides: their toxicology, metabolism in laboratory and farm animals and plants, environmental fate, and residues in food resulting from their use according to national GAP. The JMPR recommends, when possible, ADIs and Acute Reference Doses (acute RfDs) of pesticides for humans and MRLs for pesticide residues in food and feed commodities.
The residue levels that the JMPR recommends for use as MRLs are estimated by identifying the highest population (range and magnitude) of pesticide residues resulting from treatments according to GAP for which sufficient data are available. MRLs generally apply to primary food commodities when they enter the market.
Good Agricultural Practice (GAP) in the use of pesticides includes the nationally authorised safe uses of pesticides under actual conditions necessary for effective pest control. It encompasses a range of levels of pesticide applications up to the highest authorised use, applied in a manner which leaves a residue which is the smallest amount practicable. (Codex Alimentarius Commission procedural manual, 9th ed., p. 60). Owing to differences in pest infestation, the resistance of pests, and growing conditions, the level of residues remaining in or on food and feed commodities may differ significantly according to geographical location.
Codex MRLs are intended primarily to enforce and control compliance with nationally authorized uses of pesticides on commodities moving in international trade. The definition of a residue for enforcement purposes may rely on only one component of the total residue if it sufficiently reflects the use of the given pesticide, while the inclusion of additional residue components may be necessary for estimating dietary intake or assessing risk.
The procedure used for estimating maximum residue levels means that MRLs are based on the registered uses of a pesticide and are not directly related to the ADI or acute RfD of the pesticide. The acceptability of the recommended limits for a pesticide from the point of view of food safety is assessed by the JMPR by estimating the dietary intake of that pesticide. In estimating the dietary intake all relevant information, such as the residues in each individual commodity for which MRLs are recommended, regional diets, and the effects of processing and cooking, is taken into account. The estimated daily intake is compared with the permissible intake of the residue, calculated from the ADI or acute RfD.
The Meeting noted that the WTO had decided to use Codex MRLs as criteria for the acceptability of food in international trade, and emphasized that it would continue to base its recommendations on the critical assessment of all available scientific knowledge and information based on experimental data. One of its basic scientific principles is to protect human health and the quality of the environment by recommending MRLs that are no higher than necessary to reflect national GAP and to keep residue levels as low as practicable in order to reduce the exposure of consumers and the environment resulting from the use of pesticides.
2.4 Estimation of extraneous residue limits (ERLs)
An Extraneous Residue Limit (ERL) for JMPR purposes refers to a pesticide residue arising from environmental sources (including former agricultural uses) other than the use of the pesticide directly or indirectly on the commodity containing the residue. It is the maximum concentration of a pesticide residue that is recommended by the Codex Alimentarius Commission to be legally permitted or recognized as acceptable in or on a food, agricultural commodity, or animal feed (1990 JMPR report, Section 2.7).
The 1995 report of the JMPR (Section 2.8.2) includes a summary of the general JMPR principles for estimating ERLs. Two views were expressed by governments at the 1996 CCPR on the estimation of ERLs (CX/PR 96/5 Add. 1); a conflicting view was subsequently expressed by a third government. The views emphasized the inclusion or exclusion of 'outliers'.
The Meeting concluded that the meaning of the term 'outlier' should be clear in the context of its use. In the context of ERLs, the JMPR does not consider extreme values to be outliers in a statistical sense, because high residue levels are usually not true statistical outliers but values on the tail of a large distribution. The challenge is to decide when it is reasonable to discard those values in order to reflect the expected gradual decline in the levels of chemicals that are typically subject to ERL estimates, while not creating unnecessary barriers to trade.
Generally, the JMPR considers that the databases needed for estimating ERLs should be significantly larger than those required for the estimation of MRLs, because ERL data do not fit a normal distribution. For example, samples from 598 animals are needed to ensure that the estimated ERLs cover 99.5% of a population, allowing a 0.5% violation rate with 95% confidence (Codex Alimentarius, Vol. II, 2nd Ed., p. 372). As ERL data are derived from the random monitoring of different populations, the JMPR does not normally consider a 'world' population of data, but gives independent consideration to different populations, e.g. of different geographical regions or of different animals, before deciding which data populations might be combined. As noted above, the intention is to avoid unnecessary restrictions to trade.
The JMPR compares data distributions in terms of the likely percentages of violations that might occur if a given ERL is proposed. The JMPR is unaware of any internationally agreed level of violations that is recognized as unacceptable. Generally, the JMPR assumes that violation rates of 0.2-0.5% or greater are unacceptable. The JMPR would welcome views from governments on the levels of violation that are considered unacceptable.
For the reasons given above and on the basis of the approaches to estimating ERLs described in the report of the 1995 JMPR, the JMPR chooses not to endorse the country proposals to include or exclude high values. It is unlikely that governments will give consistent guidance on the use of outliers, and the JMPR cannot be a referee. Another reason is that compounds for which ERLs are estimated are no longer approved for use on agricultural commodities because of existing or previous health or environmental concerns.
It is to be expected that there will be a gradual reduction and/or elimination of residues of the chemicals for w
