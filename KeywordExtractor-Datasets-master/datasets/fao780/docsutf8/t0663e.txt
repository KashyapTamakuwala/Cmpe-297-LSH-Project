Organization of the conference
1. The Seventeenth FAO Regional Conference for Africa was held at the Accra International Conference Centre, the Republic of Ghana, from 20 to 24 July 1992, under the theme "Sound Environment for Sustainable Agriculture in Africa."
2. The Conference was attended by 167 delegates from 35 Member Nations of the Region, 28 of which were represented at ministerial level; nine observers from Member Nations outside the Region, representatives of the United Nations Specialized Agencies including Mrs. Catherine Bertini, the Executive Director of the World Food Programme (WFP), and 12 observers from intergovernmental organizations and representatives of national liberation movements recognized by the Organization of African Unity (OAU). A list of participants is given as Appendix B of the Report; while Appendix C contains a list of Conference documents.
3. The Independent Chairman of the FAO Council, Mr Antoine Saintraint, attended the Conference.
Inaugural ceremony
4. The Director-General of FAO, Mr Edouard Saouma, welcomed the delegates on behalf of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. He paid a special tribute to the Chairman of the Provisional National Defence Council and Head of State of the Republic of Ghana, His Excellency Flight Lieutenant Jerry John Rawlings under whose wise leadership Ghana's economy had made remarkable progress in overcoming the structural imbalances that were major obstacles to the economic and social development of the people. He observed that the food and agricultural sector had been accorded high priority in Ghana, and that the sector response to policy measures had been impressive, with cocoa production .doubling in less than a decade.
5. The high-level representation at the Conference, the Director-General observed, was a manifestation of the keen interest of Member Nations in the items on the agenda. He paid tribute to the Ghanaian authorities for all the courtesies and warm hospitality extended to the delegates and for the excellent facilities provided.
6. The Chairman of the PNDC, Flight Lieutenant Jerry John Rawlings extended a hearty and warm welcome to the delegates. In his inaugural address, he regretted the continued pain, indignity and dehumanizing effects of recurrent food shortages in the Africa Region. Referring to the issues to be considered by the Conference, the Head of State acknowledged the relevance of the agenda to Ghana's agricultural situation.
7. He informed the Conference that approximately seventy percent of Ghanaians were engaged in agriculture. Since they were illiterate, however, they could not take full advantage of the Conference deliberations and recommendations. He expressed the hope that ways would be found to bring the rich knowledge of the Conference within the reach of small-scale farmers, whose labours continued to ensure the nation's survival.
8. The Chairman observed that since the Conference was taking place after the recent United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, the theme chosen for the Conference, "Sound Environment for Sustainable Agriculture in Africa", was pertinent. He invited delegates to prescribe simple solutions that addressed the basic issues and not just the symptoms.
9. He regretted that the hopes generated by the "Earth Summit" had been frustrated by its failure to address the problem of reconciling environmental preservation with the legitimate concerns of poor countries. He underscored that future generations should not be deprived of the opportunity to enjoy their lives on an earth capable of sustaining and enhancing their well-being. He referred to the menaces created by soil erosion, desertification, deforestation, declining rainfall, bushfires, crop failure, over-grazing, hunger and malnutrition which hampered man's legitimate-pursuit of a normal means of livelihood.
10. The Chairman, in conclusion, regretted the perpetuation of unfair international economic relations. He appealed for rational exploitation of resources that would preserve the environment. He further appealed for substantial amounts of resources to support research endeavours, and for the implementation of appropriate development policies, strategies and programmes that would best transform African traditional agriculture into a modern system incorporating improved technological packages for sustainable agriculture without degrading the environment. The full statement is given in Appendix E.
Election of chairman, vice-chairmen and rapporteur
11. At its first working session, the Conference elected, by acclamation, Mr Ibrahim Adam, Acting PNDC Secretary for Agriculture of the Republic of Ghana, as its Chairman. In a short acceptance speech, the Minister expressed his appreciation to the delegates for the honour bestowed upon his country in presiding over the Conference. He stated that the Conference was being held at a very important moment for the African Region since it had followed the "Earth Summit" held in Rio de Janeiro. He appealed to delegates for their cooperation in discharging the responsibilities conferred on him.
12. The Conference then elected, by acclamation, the Honourable Louis Nduwimana, Minister of Development, Tourism and Environment of the Republic of Burundi, and the Honourable Themba N. Masuku, Minister of Agriculture and Cooperatives of Swaziland as its First and Second Vice-Chairmen, respectively. Mr Assefa Yilala, Alternate Permanent Representative of Ethiopia to FAO, was elected Rapporteur.
Adoption of the agenda and timetable
13. The Conference considered and adopted its agenda, as reproduced in Appendix A to this Report.
Statement by the director-general of FAO
14. In his keynote address, Mr Edouard Saouma, the Director-General of FAO, praised the pioneering leadership role played by Ghana, since its independence, in promoting the notion of African nationalism leading to the attainment of political independence in many African countries. He recalled that it was in Ghana that Pan Africanism and the establishment of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) had been promoted. It was with similar sentiment that the meeting which led to the establishment of the FAO Regional Office for Africa had been held in Accra some 30 years ago.
15. The Director-General recalled that since the last Regional Conference in 1990, several measures had been adopted. The move towards democracy, the changing political situation in South Africa, the willingness of certain major creditor nations to alleviate or even to cancel the debts of several African countries raised expectations for rapid economic and social progress. He commended both the World Bank and the African Development Bank that had also increased their allocation of resources for African development projects and were assisting many countries in managing their economies. He stated that FAO was pleased to associate itself with these endeavours by making effective contributions in their achievements. In particular, FAO had supported measures to conserve and to rehabilitate African lands, to develop technical cooperation among developing countries, and to strengthen regional cooperation and integration efforts.
16. The Director-General regretted that the expectations for rapid economic and social development had been frustrated. He observed that Africa had been facing devastating challenges, in particular, as related to high population growth, environmental degradation, the unfavourable economic climate, and adverse human activity. The consequences of these unmet challenges had resulted in widespread social dislocation, and were unfortunately leading to social conflicts. Emigration had reached alarming proportions; while African economies as a whole continued to depend exclusively on raw materials to enhance their development and pay for their imports. He stated that while exports in volume terms grew by four percent a year, export earnings declined by six percent annually due to declining export prices. There were no immediate prospects for improvement in the effort international terms of trade. Governments did not have the means to manage their surpluses or to subsidize
agriculture. Likewise, African farmers continued to receive inadequate assistance and could raise their incomes only by producing more by utilizing methods that, in the absence of inputs, gradually undermined the resource base. He said aid was obviously not a viable solution, and only served as a derisory palliative.
17. Referring to Structural Adjustment Programmes (SAP) currently being implemented in many African countries with the support of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, the Director-General doubted their effectiveness because of conflicting aims to reduce expenditures and contain demand on the one hand, while increasing output supply and effort earnings on the other. However, weak economies and national poverty levels had prevented a reversal of the course of events, and the adverse impact on vulnerable population groups had been particularly devastating, especially in undermining food security. International aid had mitigated the consequences of this situation, but the level of overall assistance had been modest. The Director-General also cautioned against wars, tensions and destabilizing domestic conflicts as destructive human actions that threatened the fate and future of Africans.
18. The Director-General observed that Africa, nevertheless, had its winning cards: the countless small-scale farmers and its natural resources. A prerequisite for success, however, was the political commitment to achieve sustained growth in the agriculture and food production sectors through incentives, inputs, institutions and infrastructures.
19. In conclusion, the Director-General appealed to the international community to recognize Africa's importance to the world and to assist the continent in overcoming its economic depression. FAO was proud to feature among the most fervent defenders of African interests and he requested that care, flexibility and delicacy be used in understanding the African situation. The full text of the Director-General's statement is attached as Appendix E.

Country statements and general debate on the food and agriculture situation in Africa
20. Country statements were presented by Delegates from the folowing 23 countries (in order of presentation): Ethiopia, Mauritius, Togo, Nigeria, Cote d'Ivoire, Malawi, Gambia, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Senegal, Mali, Botswana, Niger, Sierra Leone, Swaziland, Ghana, Namibia, Benin, Angola, Morocco, Congo and Mauritania. The country statements of the delegation of the Republic of Cape Verde and Algeria were filed with the Regional Conference. The Conference also listened to statements by observers from the Organization of African Unity, the African National Congress and by the representative of the United Nations.
21. Mrs Catherine Bertini, Executive Director of the World Food Programme (WFP), briefed the Conference on the activities of the WFP most of which contributed to the protection of the environment and increased food and agricultural production in Africa in addition to providing emergency food relief. The Executive Director informed the Conference that Africa received about forty percent of WFP resources.
22. In his brief address, the Independent Chairman of the FAO Council, Mr Antoine Saintraint, recalled the role and functions of FAO. He underlined the interdependence of countries and the fundamental need for cooperation and coordination among UN institutions and other development agencies to reinforce efficiency in project implementation.
23. The Conference expressed appreciation for Africa's large share in the FAO budgetary allocation and paid tribute to the Director-General for his untiring efforts in bringing the critical economic situation in the Region to the attention of the international community. It was recalled that FAO, at both local and national levels, carried out intensive programmes over a wide range of activities in the fields of agriculture, and in the fishery and forestry sectors, including support for institution building inasmuch as resources permitted. The Conference appreciated that,, environmental concerns had recently become a major focus of the Organization's programme in Africa. It also appreciated the promotion of technical cooperation among African countries, as well as the establishment of technical cooperation networks.
24. The Conference regretted that the implementation of the Organization's programme of work was being hamstrung by budgetary shortfalls and instability. The Conference, therefore, appealed to all Member Nations who had not yet paid their assessed statutory contributions for the current year, including arrears, to honour their obligations to the Organization. In particular, it recalled the compelling need for Member Nations in arrears to meet their obligations so that the Programme of Work and Budget approved by the Twenty-sixth Session of the Conference of FAO in 1991 could be fully implemented.
25. Delegations reported on their countries' ongoing policies, programmes and strategies aimed at improving overall agricultural and socio-economic development. The efforts made involved management of natural resources and the disengagement of the state from some major economic activities in favour of the private sector. Delegations also reported on their active preparations for the forthcoming International Conference on Nutrition (ICN) to be held in Rome in early December 1992. The importance of the Conference in addressing nutritional and diet-related problems, especially among the poor and other vulnerable groups, was stressed.
26. The Conference indicated that the problem of environmental degradation was crucial since past development initiatives, especially food production and related activities, had failed to address the issue firmly. The Conference acknowledged that as the natural resource base was the principal source of productive activities, the increasing degradation of arable and rangelands in many parts of Africa was posing a very serious ecological threat.
27. Delegations reported on a variety of environmental deteriorations in their countries. Delegates from Eastern and Southern Africa reported that the sub-region was suffering from the severest drought in living memory. The drought had had devastating consequences for both human, livestock and wildlife population primarily due to acute shortfalls in food production and there had been widespread hunger, malnutrition, outright famine and abject poverty. The sub-region which used to enjoy a reasonable self-sufficiency in food supply was relying on emergency food aid. The Conference appreciated relief and other forms of assistance being provided by the international community and appealed for more aid to mitigate the human suffering through long-term development programmes. It expressed appreciation for FAO's Global Information and Early Warning System (GIEWS) which had been instrumental in alerting the international community to the plight of the sub-region. The Conference
appealed to the Director-General to assist Member Nations in developing their water resources, especially as regarded the expansion in irrigation to compensate for variations in weather conditions. The Conference also appealed to the Director-General of FAO to provide support to Member Nations of the Region in strengthening their institutional capacity regarding Early Warning Programmes.
28. The Sahel sub-region which had been afflicted by recurrent drought in the 1970's and 1980's, generally enjoyed relatively good weather conditions, and sporadic drought was only experienced in a few areas. However, delegations from the sub-region expressed concern with the resurgence of insect pests, especially locusts. The Conference, therefore, appealed to the Director-General to assist in the reactivation of OCLALAV. Despite some of these environmental problems, one Member Nation in the sub-region reported a bumper harvest of millet in 1991 and was able to export the cereal.
29. The Conference expressed concern with the adverse weather conditions in the eastern, southern and the Sahel sub-regions, and with deforestation in the forest-belt. Concern was expressed by several delegations about the combined effects of environmental stress which, apart from degrading the resource base, was encouraging a large-scale drift of young people from rural to urban centres to escape increasing rural poverty.
30. Many delegations also referred to the dual effects of Structural Adjustment Programmes (SAP) which many countries were implementing with the support of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. While monetary, fiscal, trade and exchange rate policies being implemented under SAP had improved the incentives, eliminated distortions in the economies and had potential beneficial effects on the performance of the agricultural sector, the benefits had been outweighed by the economic and social costs of adjustment. Delegations recalled that protection of the environment, for instance, would require the adoption of improved technological packages using technical and productive inputs such as organic and mineral fertilizers, insecticide and improved seeds. The Conference regretted that as the sharp increase in the imported input prices had not been matched by a corresponding increase in output prices, there had been a steep decline in relative profitability of input use.
The Conference therefore regretted that the removal of fiscal incentives (subsidies) from these input prices, and budgetary reduction would have deleterious effects on the performance of the agricultural sector.
31. The Conference noted that the use of these inputs required a well-organized system of financial intermediation in rural areas with sufficient resources (agricultural credit). However, the Conference regretted that the prohibitively high interest rates had increased the cost of borrowing beyond the means of small-scale farmers.
32. The Conference, therefore, requested the Director-General to continue to intensify FAO studies on the contractionary effects of some measures being implemented under SAP, especially as regarded their effects on food security. Furthermore, many delegations requested the FAO to assist Member Nations of the Region in formulating their agricultural policies under SAP framework.
33. Commenting on the organization of the Regional Conference, the Conference urged FAO to reintroduce the practice of convening the Technical Committee before the Plenary Session to permit in-depth analysis of issues before the Conference. The Conference felt that the two meetings could still be held within a week - devoting three days to the Technical Committee proceedings and two to the Plenary Session.
Report on FAO activities in the region 1990-91
34. The Assistant Director-General and Regional Representative for Africa introduced this Agenda item. ^1 He briefly described the adverse political and economic situation under which the agricultural sector's performance had to be evaluated in the Region.
^1 ARC/92/2
35. He stressed that despite some improvements during the biennium, the food and agriculture situation in the Region continued to face such serious problems as environmental degradation, deforestation and unfavourable climatic conditions. Therefore, the Region's food self-sufficiency rate did not register appreciable and durable improvement.
36. FAO continued to give high priority to the Region's agricultural and rural development, allocating more than half of its limited resources to Africa. Although the Organization's capacity to respond to the needs of the African farmer was further eroded during the biennium by persistent financial constraints, FAO had endeavoured to support Member Governments' efforts in such priority areas as management and conservation of land and water resources, policy analysis and advice in key sectors, strengthening of agricultural research capacity at national and regional levels, promotion of rural development including the enhancement of women's role in rural activities, assessment of the nutritional impact of agricultural policies and improvement of the nutritional status of the rural population. Forestry had also received attention, in particular afforestation for fuelwood and multi-purpose management of vegetation cover in dryland areas. In fisheries, action had been taken
according to the strategy adopted by the World Fisheries Conference, and fish consumption in human nutrition was promoted.
37. The Regional Representative then summarized FAO activities in the Region during the biennium under the Regular Programme, Field Programme and Special Action Programmes. He emphasized that cooperation between FAO and the regional and sub-regional inter-governmental organizations, as well as with non-governmental organizations, had been strengthened during the past biennium and he made particular reference to efforts in promoting technical and economic cooperation among developing countries.
38. The Conference expressed appreciation for the wide range of programmes being implemented in the Region, but regretted that continued financial shortfalls and instability were hampering the expansion of urgently-needed programmes. It repeated its appeal for assessed contributions to FAO to be paid promptly. The Conference re-echoed its recommendations made during past Regional Conferences for the Regional Office for Africa to be strengthened, provided with adequate financial resources, and delegated with sufficient authority to promote economic and technical cooperation among African countries especially as regarded common resources shared by several countries, pests and disease control, and such special programmes as the International Scheme for the Conservation and Rehabilitation of African Lands.
FAO medium-term plan 1994-99: Regional dimensions
39. The Assistant Director-General and Regional Representative for Africa also introduced this item. ^2 He recalled the severe problems faced by the Africa Region in meeting its economic and social development objectives. He emphasized the daunting challenges which the agricultural scene throughout the Region was facing, especially as regarded soil fertility depletion, erratic rainfall and recurrent drought, underdeveloped irrigation potentials, poor animal husbandry practices, and low priority and inadequate resource allocations to the fisheries sector. Desertification in semi-arid and sub-humid lands and the destruction of tropical forests also remained two major problems facing the Region.
^2 ARC/92/2-Sup. l
40. Rural areas were still beset by problems of unemployment, inadequate education, poor social services and nutritional status. Policy formulation and planning in all the sectors were hampered by the general lack of reliable data, inadequate knowledge of traditional farming systems and insufficient manpower training. In concluding his introduction, the Regional Representative informed the Conference that the Medium-Term Plan's main focus would be to support the efforts of African Member Nations in addressing these issues globally through environmental and resource management activities that promoted sustainable development objectives. In this connection research capacities would be upgraded to meet the needs of small-scale farmers while reconciling conservation and rehabilitation goals. The Organization of African Unity (OAU), regional and sub-regional economic groupings and Non-Governmental Organizations (NGO) would continue to be major partners in this endeavour.
Implementation of the programme of action of the World Conference on Agrarian Reform and Rural Development
41. In presenting this agenda item ^3, the Senior Officer (Production Systems) traced the history of WCARRD whose origins dated back to the pervasive and persistent deterioration in the conditions of life of rural population throughout the developing world since the 1960s. Since then, Africa had emerged as the continent with the worst symptoms of economic crisis, characterized by severe food deficits, and weak and deficient agrarian structures and policies. He enumerated the tasks assigned to Governments and International Agencies in the implementation of the Declaration of Principle and Programme of Action. The implementation of WCARRD could have achieved sustained growth and development only if material progress had been associated with social justice and the deliberate involvement of the poorer segment of the rural populations.
^3 ARC/92/3
42. He summarized progress achieved at the national level by FAO and other United Nations Agencies in the implementation of the Plan of Action. The weaknesses discovered were summarized as: (a) the absence at the national level of a WCARRD strategy that would facilitate the implementation of a Government programme to achieve set objectives; (b) priority given to economic policy reforms under structural adjustment programmes that overshadowed and detracted official attention from WCARRD principles and that relegated it to the level of peripheral interest by some Governments; (c) awareness of WCARRD and the Peasant's Charter confined to a limited number of government officials, while coupled with minimal awareness by still fewer of the most active NGO's.
43. He invited the Conference to consider the need to decide on the adoption of a Minimum Action Plan to be executed over the next four years at sub-regional and regional levels. He concluded by reconfirming FAO's commitment and resolve to mobilize its technical competence in support of African Governments and its endeavour to achieve the objectives set out in the Peasant's Charter.
44. The Conference expressed grave concern a
