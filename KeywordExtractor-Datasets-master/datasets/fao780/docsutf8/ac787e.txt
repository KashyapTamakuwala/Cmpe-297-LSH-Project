The major challenge in projecting wood and fibre supplies is to estimate the future availability of tree and forest resources that will continue to be used for production and to calculate the volume of roundwood that might be produced from such areas. A basic input for any projection is the area of production forests and forest plantations. Unfortunately, comprehensive forest inventory information of national forest plantation resources, particularly those owned by the private sector is generally scarce. Available figures are often weak and unreliable and improving the underlying statistics requires continuous efforts. Developing new and refining existing data collection frameworks remain a priority. The question as to what role forest plantations might play in meeting the future demand for forest products is linked closely to past, current and future patterns in forest plantation development. As most projections can only rely on provisional or indicative data, tentative analyses and ballpark figures or guesstimates are common. There are numerous reasons for this shortcoming. One is that most forest departments concentrate their efforts on collecting data and presenting information on public sector plantations only. Until recently, this approach was justified. However, a global shift towards privatization has led to increasing investments in plantation development by the private sector. In relative terms the plantation areas administered and managed by the public sector ­ the state forest department in the case of Peninsular Malaysia ­ are shrinking, although in many countries the public sector continues to dominate the plantation sector. In Peninsular Malaysia, it is expected that the private sector will play a more important role in the development of plantations. The government encourages private sector involvement and promotes the privatization of its own plantations. While demand is increasing and the commercial sector is also increasingly interested in forest plantation development to secure raw materials for its processing plants, there is no information on the status of the spatial extent and quality of private plantations in Peninsular Malaysia. As a case study of the involvement of the private sector in Peninsular Malaysia, this study will assess the status of private forest plantations.
Approach and methodology.
For this study a thorough survey approach was adopted to prepare a database on private sector forest plantations. In Peninsular Malaysia, such a study is possible within a few months because the nation is small compared to countries such as India or China. The total land area in Peninsular Malaysia is 13 million ha. About six million ha constitute natural forests with protection and production functions. Forest plantations are located in the non-forest areas. As Peninsular Malaysia is divided into 11 states, a state-wise survey approach therefore seemed logical. Using this approach, the survey was carried out via visits to each state where data were recorded in the field. This ensured that the extent of forest plantations could be documented accurately. Initially, the relevant data to be collected were identified. A uniform data collection sheet was developed (Appendix 1) that detailed data on location, species planted, spatial extent, planting system employed and ownership, cultural practices, reason for planting timber species and plantation terrain. Each state was combed systematically and all the existing forest plantations, established by small- and large-scale investors, were documented. Most of the information was obtained through interviews with representatives of relevant companies, farmers and state authorities. To facilitate and accelerate data collection, individual state forest departments and agricultural departments and the various agencies involved were informed in writing of the study objectives and asked to assist the data collecting team during the field work. Before visiting the field, several meetings were held with these departments and other agencies such as the Federal Land.
Development Authority (FELDA) and the Rubber Industry Smallholders Development Authority (RISDA) to refine the survey design. Where possible, the departments were asked to appoint one officer to assist the team. Time permitting, the field officers were also asked to start data collection before the team arrived. Similar requests were also sent to FELDA and RISDA who have land banks with the potential for forest plantation development. Following this notification, the data collection team ­ consisting of seven members ­ was briefed on the survey procedures. A survey plan was prepared and the team was divided into three groups, each comprising one assistant research officer and one research assistant. Several states were allotted to each of the groups. To ensure the team had understood the nature of the task, the survey was tested in the state of Selangor. After adjusting the survey forms (see Appendix 1), the three groups visited the respective states, and the survey was completed in four months (Table 1). Teams had approximately one month for each state. In each state they met with the state forestry officer assigned to the study. The team visited various state agencies and district offices to locate areas assigned or planted with forest plantations before interviewing plantation owners during the field visits.

Data analysis.
The data were analysed at the Forest Research Institute Malaysia (FRIM). Some background information on current plantation status was first collated from the records available at FRIM and Forest Department, Peninsular Malaysia. This included: Records of plantations established between 1915 and 1982 and their locations; Updated information on Acacia mangium plantations; and Reference to previous records of plantations to verify the new data collected. Next, the data collected during the survey were keyed into Excel spreadsheets for each state. Summaries were then generated for the whole of Peninsular Malaysia. All information presented in this report was derived from the data analysis.
Survey cost.
Costs included the wages of the field officers and the assistant research officers (AROs) for a period of four months. The monthly wages of each accompanying state officer were also taken into account for a period of one month per officer. Lodging and food expenses for each ARO amounted to RM100 per day. For the assistants the rate was RM60 per day. Vehicle rental came to RM150 per day, which included fuel costs and the daily wage of the driver. As this was the first survey of its kind the costs for each hectare of plantation surveyed were quite high. However, if the total non-forest area is considered, the costs are fairly low (Table 2).

Experience gained.
If the land area of a particular country is small, it may be possible to carry out the initial ground survey to develop the first database with few errors and relatively quickly. Once the database is established, data sheets of the existing plantations can be distributed to the respective state forestry office. Providing additional data sheets allows for regular updates in each state. In this way, the state forestry offices can then be charged to furnish updated information on private plantations at the end of each year to the central agency, which is responsible for updating the main database. In large countries such as India and China and when funds are limited, it may not be feasible for a single agency to conduct a ground survey as this would be time consuming and costly. In such cases, a standard format for data collection has to be developed. This facilitates the consolidation of data collected by different agencies in an effective and accurate way. In each state, province or district an officer ­ probably from the forestry department ­ should be appointed to carry out the survey and to manage the collected data. The data can then be transmitted to a single agency that can then build up a database. Following the survey carried out in Peninsular Malaysia during this study, it is proposed that the state forestry departments take the responsibility to update the database on an annual basis. Related activities will become part of their daily duties, which would reduce costs substantially. Guidelines for cost-effective data collection and database development.
Identify a central agency or unit responsible for data collection and database maintenance.
The agency should prepare a standard survey form for data collection incorporating all the required details for supporting the private sector in plantation development and for predicting future wood supplies.
The agency should request the appointment of state, provincial or district officers who are tasked with conducting the survey.
Appointed officers are trained on data collection in the field during a pre-test.
Subsequently, appointed officers carry out the surveys. The first survey will be intensive to capture all available data on forest plantations.
All costs incurred by the officers will have to be borne by the respective state, provincial or district office.
The appointed officers are responsible for preparing the data before they are sent to the central agency for consolidation into a single database; they are then keyed into the central database.
Records need to be updated on an annual or biannual basis.
Status of forest plantations Introduction.
The total hectarage of forest plantations in the country is shown in Appendix.
This section (a) discusses the distribution of private forest plantations by state, (b) traces species inter-cropping, (c) traces the types of planting designs adopted and (d) highlights a few case studies on commercial tree planting by private investors.
Year of forest plantation establishment, distribution and species choice.
According to information released by the Forest Department, Peninsular Malaysia, forest plantations covered 74 022 ha in 2000. The data obtained by the survey conducted under this study indicate a slightly higher area of 75 672 ha for 2001. More than 15 000 ha were planted in 1988 and more than 10 000 ha in 1985, which is 20 and 15 percent of the total plantation areas, respectively. Most of the plantations were established during the first phase of the Compensatory Forest Plantation Programme between 1982 and 1988. Since 1989, annual planting rates have not exceeded 7 000 ha.

The figures in Table 3 and Figure 1 indicate that interest in planting forest species has changed over the years. Interest tended to increase whenever there was a campaign to plant trees and slowed down thereafter. The planting of sentang and teak increased immediately after FRIM organized a road show on the two species in 1996 and 1997. Planting rates declined the following year. In addition, planting rates were affected by the financial crisis that has slowed down economic growth across Southeast Asia since late 1997. The economic as well as political impacts of the crisis most likely explain the dramatic drop in planting rates since 1998. The role that individual planters played in forest plantation development was as important as that of private companies (Table 4). For example, the total area planted by individuals until the end of 2001 was 11 823 ha (15.6 percent), whereas the area planted by companies was 11 404 ha (15.1 percent). What distinguishes the two private sector groups is the area planted individually,.
which usually is much larger for a company than for individual planters. Johore, Pahang and Terengganu account for the largest area under forest plantations with more than 6 000 ha, 2 000 ha and 1 000 ha planted, respectively (Table 4).

Besides area planted, another important variable for assessing the wood supply and market potential of plantations is species distribution. In Peninsular Malaysia, the species preferred by all planters is obviously Acacia mangium. For example, of the 6 600 ha established in Johore, 6 470 ha were planted with Acacia mangium, whereas another 38 ha, 54 ha and 2 ha were planted with teak (Tectona grandis), sentang (Azadirachta excelsa), and sentang and rubber, respectively (Appendix 2). Of the 64 348 ha planted with Acacia mangium, 8 554 have been planted by private companies, 49 919 ha by government agencies and 5 875 ha by individual planters (Table 5). Sentang and teak plantations cover an area of 3 676 ha and 3 107 ha, respectively (Table 6). With regard to other species (e.g. Khaya spp. and Araucaria spp.), the total area planted is too small to have an effect on the international timber market. The volume to be produced will be too small to effectively create a market for the species. It is probably also not economic to extract small quantities of timber because of the high logging and transport costs.

About 30 percent of the plantations are located in Pahang (Table 6). Other states with considerable areas under forest plantations include Johore (20 688 ha), Selangor (10 161 ha), N. Sembilan (5 590 ha) and Terengganu (5 168 ha). The planting of forest species such as teak and sentang together with agricultural crops (e.g. rubber or oil palm) is low. For instance, the area inter-cropped with sentang and rubber totalled only 900 ha for all of Peninsular Malaysia. There is even less interest in inter-cropping with oil palm, durian, teak and other species.

Timber production from forest plantations.
A discussion on the development of forest plantations would be incomplete without considering the production of timber derived from the plantations. According to official statistics (Table 7), forest plantations were able to produce timber only on two occasions, namely in 1997 (35 030 m3) and 1998 (26 556 m3) (Forestry Department, Peninsular Malaysia 2001). There is no information on species and the destination of logs for further processing. Assuming a 15-year rotation, the total documented production probably consisted of Acacia mangium only, which was planted as early as 1985. Trees planted in 1988 have not been felled, as they are only between 12 and 13 years old. Even fast-growing species such as Acacia mangium will not be logged before 2004. Slower-growing species such as sentang and teak will not be logged before 2008 (Ahmad Zuhaidi et al. 1997) and the volumes obtained in the first years of logging can be assumed to be quite low. Hence, with.
regard to wood production forest plantations will continue to play an insignificant role compared to production from natural forests in the foreseeable future.

Planting design.
To date, forest plantations consist of single species or are mixed with agricultural crops, such as rubber and oil palm. In some cases forest species are planted as perimeter crops rather than as the main crop. Forest species usually are planted as perimeter crops on land that is either too steep ­ to reduce soil erosion and prevent landslips ­ or not fertile enough for agricultural crops. Examples of forest species planted as monocrops include Acacia mangium, teak, Khaya sp. and sentang. Species planted as mixed and perimeter crops include rubber, sentang, teak and oil palm. The planting design is related closely to the arrangement of the crops planted. It can be triangular or square. The tree arrangement and the distances between trees depend on terrain characteristics and soil type. The recommended spacing for sentang, if planted as a monocrop, is 4 x 3 m (Figure 2), and as a hedge or perimeter it is 3 x 3 m (Figure 3).

If sentang is planted as a monocrop, the common spacing in addition to 3 x 3 m and 3 x 4 m is 2 x 2 m, 3 x 8 m (Tables 8 and 9). A planting distance of 2 x 2 m is not recommended, as the ratio between height and stem diameter for a sentang tree is usually more than one. Trees that have a height-to-diameter ratio of one are usually more stable and are not blown down easily by strong winds (Ahmad Zuhaidi et al. 1997).

Case studies.
A private company The first case study involves a respondent from the southern state of the peninsula. He was optimistic about forest plantations. Originally, the respondent planted Maesopsis eminii on 96 ha. His optimism has encouraged his company to extend the plantation area with the same species.
For plantation related activities the company employs about seven management staff and five contract workers. The main plantation management objective is income generation. The company has faced various challenges, such as shortage of land and labour, and uncertainty of the market price for the final product, i.e. logs. To ensure profitability, the trees will be cut when they are 10 years old. Maesopsis eminii was chosen because it is fast growing and exhibits a uniform growth. This means that the rotations can be short and the final crop volume is more predictable than other species. The planting distance chosen for Maesopsis eminii was 4 x 4 m. Measurements taken during the field visit indicated that the average diameter was 15.4 cm and the average height was 8.1 m. The largest diameter recorded was 20.5 cm. Trees were about three years old. The excellent growth performance is probably because the area used to be a fruit orchard. The gentle slope of between six and 15 percent, together with a sandy-loamy soil type also makes the site suitable for tree planting. Nitrogen phosphate (nitrophoska) 15-15-15 and Sunbear 12-12-17 fertilizers were applied several times. Ease of application, low price and availability in the market were reasons for selecting these two fertilizers. Roundup Transorb was used as a herbicide. Weeding, climber cutting and fertilizer application were carried out during the first several years after tree planting (i.e. between year 1 and year 4). These activities are crucial for seedlings to establish a root system and adapt to the new environment. The excellent growth noted also indicates that managing the planted species from seedlings promises a better output at the end of the planting period. Individual planters Individual planters are persons who plant trees on a small piece of land (0.4 ha or less). Usually, these so-called forest plantations are located close to the owners' homes and management is on a part-time basis. However, some individual planters are fully occupied by forest plantation activities. For such planters, the growth performance of their trees has been encouraging. The two respondents selected for the case study came from Johore. Both had chosen teak as the main species. They owned forest plantations of 4 ha and 8 ha, respectively. Most tasks are performed by the respondents themselves. The first respondent indicated that he needed at least one day per month to take care of the plantation, while the second respondent (the planter with slightly more than 8 ha) spends approximately five days per month looking after his plantation. Similar to other private planters, the main objective of these respondents in tree planting was to generate additional income. They did not view shortage of land, marketing of final products, procurement of seedlings, species selection, planting skills and other related issues as problems; limited land availability may constrain extension of the plantations. The respondent with the 4 ha plot that was planted in 1995 reported that the average height and stem diameters were 16 m and 16 cm, respectively. The second planter indicated a similar average height of 16 m and a slightly lower average diameter of 13 cm. This slightly lower average diameter is to be expected because the trees were one year younger. The planting distances of the respondents with 4 and 8 ha plots were 3 x 2.4 m and 3.8 x 2.5 m, respectively. Although they lacked a detailed understanding of potential planting designs, both planters thought that the selected spacing was the most suitable for their teak. Both respondents stated that their areas were originally rubber plantations on Class I soil. Both plantations were located on terrain with between 0 and 5 percent slope, and an altitude below 100 m. The type of soil for both project areas was clay. It was also observed that both respondents used chicken manure as fertilizer, which was cheap and readily available. Both respondents declared that they had to apply fertilizer two to three times per year to boost the growth of the teak trees. Most planters interviewed had some ideas of the market for and end-uses of the species planted. For instance, teak can be used for interior finishing, panels, high-class furniture and fancy plywood, whereas sentang can be used for joinery, interior finishing and sliced veneer. The majority of the planters also expected that species such as sentang would penetrate the international market if the quantity produced was sufficient to make an impact.
Conclusions.
The database developed from the survey results provides information on not only the various agencies involved in the development of forest plantations by state but also the species planted and the age of plantations. Private forest plantations in Peninsular Malaysia are small and widely scattered. The size of the existing forest plantations is not large enough to significantly reduce the pressure on the natural forest. Plantation development in Peninsular Malaysia needs to be supported by incentives and a planting campaign. Socio-economic and biophysical aspects of private forest plantations.
Introduction.
Socio-economic and biophysical aspects of forest plantations established by private companies and individual planters cover basic information on: type of planter, land use, labour utilization, reasons for planting, problems faced in planting, future plans, planting characteristics (type of species planted, use of fertilizer, area planted, planting year, spacing, previous crops), tending and growth performance (land preparation, weeding, climber cutting, survival rate, replanting) and market perception (potential market, buyers and end-usage). The information presented here is derived from interviews with representatives of six companies and 21 individual planters who provided complete data to all the questions asked.1.
Basic information of the respondents.
Type of planter Most planters are individuals and only a minority are companies (Table 10). The six companies involved in forest plantation development are located in Pahang, Negeri Sembilan, Johore and Perlis. Among the individual planters, Malacca and Johore comprised two-thirds of the total individual planters.

Land use The pattern of agricultural land use indicates the extent of importance placed on tree planting by companies and individuals. Of the total 4 803 ha of agricultural land owned, 495 ha (10 percent) were planted with forest tree species. This is a new phenomenon considering the fact that in the 1980s not many people were seriously considering planting forest trees on private land. This change in land use is most noticeable among the individual planters. Of the 100 ha of agricultural.
The total number of companies and individuals surveyed was 157 and 1 575, respectively.
land owned, about 47 ha (46.5 percent) were planted with forest trees. Private companies allocated only 449 ha (9.5 percent) of the 4 702 ha of the agricultural land they owned to forest tree planting (Table 11). Two main reasons explain the difference. The younger people prefer to work in urban areas, which translates into labour shortages for agriculture. As most areas are small, it is not economic to employ local or foreign workers. As owners become older, they prefer to grow trees, which require less labour than annual crops, and are expected to provide income in the future. Private companies on the other hand are more cautious with regard to long-term investments in forest plantations.
