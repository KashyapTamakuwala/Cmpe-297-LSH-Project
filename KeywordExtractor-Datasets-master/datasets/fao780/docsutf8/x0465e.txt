Cato, J.C. Economic values associated with seafood safety and implementation of seafood Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) programmes. FAO Fisheries Technical Paper. No. 381. Rome, FAO. 1998. 70p. ABSTRACT Seventy percent of the world's catch of fish and fishery products is consumed as food. Fish and shellfish products represent 15.6 percent of animal protein supply and 5.6 percent of total protein supply on a worldwide basis. Developing countries account for almost 50 percent of global fish exports. Seafood-borne disease or illness outbreaks affect consumers both physically and financially, and create regulatory problems for both importing and exporting countries. Seafood safety as a commodity cannot be purchased in the marketplace and government intervenes to regulate the safety and quality of seafood. Theoretical issues and data limitations create problems in estimating what consumers will pay for seafood safety and quality. The costs and benefits of seafood safety must be considered at all levels, including the fishers, fish farmers, input suppliers to fishing, processing and trade, seafood processors, seafood distributors, consumers and government. Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) programmes are being implemented on a worldwide basis for seafood. Studies have been completed to estimate the cost of HACCP in various shrimp, fish and shellfish plants in the United States, and are underway for some seafood plants in the United Kingdom, Canada and Africa. Major developments within the last two decades have created a set of complex trading situations for seafood. Current events indicate that seafood safety and quality can be used as non-tariff barriers to free trade. Research priorities necessary to estimate the economic value and impacts of achieving safer seafood are outlined at the consumer, seafood production and processing, trade and government levels. An extensive list of references on the economics of seafood safety and quality is presented.

INTRODUCTION.
This paper1 focuses on the economic values associated with seafood safety.2 Data are provided on the production, trade and consumption of seafood as a worldwide food commodity. A review is provided of the market for seafood safety, the economic concepts of valuing seafood safety and estimation methods that can be used to assign monetary values for safer seafood. Practical approaches to valuing seafood safety which include measuring risks, data problems and policy issues are discussed. Issues covered include HACCP benefits and costs including how HACCP can affect seafood market structure. Available estimates of seafood HACCP implementation costs at the industry and firm level are summarized. The economic and policy issues of using HACCP to increase the safety of seafood are presented. Using HACCP as an international trade standard for insuring safe seafood is discussed, including the way impacts differ among developed versus developing countries. Different designs for seafood safety regulatory regimes also create different economic impacts among countries and the seafood industry. Recent studies valuing seafood safety are presented, including estimation techniques used, safety and quality assurances measured, willingness-to-pay by consumers for safer seafood and the effect of consumer education on seafood consumption. Research priorities for the future are suggested.
SEAFOOD PRODUCTION, CONSUMPTION AND TRADE.
Estimates in the early 1970s predicted the potential for traditionally exploited marine species was about 100 million tonnes per year (FAO 1997a). Despite development of non-traditional species, marine fishery production by 1994 reached only 90 million tonnes with capture fisheries accounting for 84 million tonnes. In 1994, the world's 200 major fishery resources accounted for 77 percent of marine fish production. About 35 percent of these resources are showing declining yields, about 25 percent are leveled at high exploitation rates, 40 percent are still developing and none remain at an undeveloped level (FAO 1997b). Thus, about 60 percent of the.

Email: jcc@gnv.ifas.ufl.edu The term seafood safety describes the implication of seafood in transmitting seafood-borne disease or illness to humans. Thus, a "safer" seafood implies a lowered risk of contracting a disease or illness from consuming the seafood. Seafood can be low quality, but not implicated in disease or illness transmittal. However, safe but low quality seafood is sometimes rejected in use or in international trade. Safety, used in the context of this paper includes both safety and quality, when one or the other creates economic gains or losses in the trade and consumption of seafood. The section of the paper on seafood safety and quality contains a more detailed discussion of this distinction.
-2world's major fisheries resources are mature or declining, and there is a need to establish more effective management controls, reduce overall fishing effort and rebuild overfished stocks. In a few remaining areas of the world, it is possible to increase effort and landings. FAO estimates indicate that an increase of 10 million tonnes to a world total production of 93 million tonnes is possible only through management improvements and further fishery development of the capture sector (FAO 1997b). Another prediction indicates an additional 20 million tonnes is possible, but only if degraded resources are rehabilitated, under-developed resources are exploited further, overfishing is avoided in these as well as in those resources currently fully exploited, and discarding and waste are reduced (FAO 1997a). This creates important implications regarding the world's supply of food, since about 70 percent of the world catch of fish and fishery products is consumed as food. On a worldwide basis, the total food supply of fish and fishery products was 74 million metric tonnes (live weight of fish) in 1993. This is the largest amount recorded, and represents an amount almost 2.5 times greater than in the early 1960s. Food fish and fishery product supply on a per capita basis was 13.4 kilograms (live weight of fish) in 1993. The 1991-1993 average was 13.0 kilograms, compared to the 1961-1963 average of 9.2 kilograms. Increases since the early 1960s have been steady and gradual, with the principal growth in demand for fish as food coming through population increases. For low-income food-deficit countries, per capita supply was 9.6 kilograms in 1993. The 1991-93 average of 9.0 kilograms per capita was slightly double the 1961-1963 average of 4.3 kilograms per capita. On a relative basis, fish and fishery products has become a more important food product for low-income fooddeficit countries. Fish represent 20.6 percent of all animal proteins and 4.7 percent of all proteins consumed per capita in low-income food-deficit countries. Fish and fishery products represent 15.6 percent of animal protein supply and about 5.6 percent of total protein supply on a worldwide basis. This percentage has been stable over the last 33 years, ranging from a low of 13.8 percent to a high of 16.0 percent (FAO 1996). International trade in fish and fishery products has grown substantially over the last three decades. The value of fish entering the world export market has increased over twenty times from the 1968 value of US$2.2 billion to the 1993-1995 average annual value of US$46.95 billion (Table 1). Adjusting for inflation to measure the increase in real value terms, the 1993-1995 value is still five times greater that the 1968 value3. Today, more than 30 percent of the fish caught for direct human consumption enters international trade. Developing countries account for almost 50 percent of global fish exports (Karnicki 1997). The share of exports from developing countries reached an all-time high of 51 percent with their net receipts from foreign exchange increasing from US$10.4 billion in 1990 to US$18.0 billion in 1995 (Lem and Shehadeh 1997). Sixteen different countries averaged exports over US$1.0 billion annually from 1991 to 1993. These 16 countries accounted for 66 percent of world exports with 50 countries exporting 96 percent of the world total. Thailand was the leading exporter at US$4.0 billion. The others were as follows (all US$): United States, $3.3 billion; Norway, $2.7 billion; Denmark $2.3 billion; China Taiwan, $2.3 billion; China Mainland, $2.2 billion; Indonesia, $1.6 billion; Russian Federation,.

Asia is the leading exporting region with 36.5 percent of the total, followed by Europe at 28.9 percent and North America at 14.7 percent. The European Community is the leading fish exporting organized bloc with 21.3 percent of the world total,.
-4followed by the NAFTA countries at 12.8 percent. In the case of Asia, Japan has a minor role in exports, indicating the importance of the dependence on seafood exports by the remaining Asian countries. This is significant in that a large number of countries who rely individually on exports to the European Union, the United States and Japan, will need to clearly comply with recently reorganized seafood safety and quality standards of those counties in order to continue this export position. The average annual value of fish commodities imported worldwide from 1993 to 1995 was US$50.56 billion (Table 1). Fifty countries accounted for almost 98 percent of imports. Japan was the leading country with US$16.1 billion in fish commodity imports (32 percent of world total), followed by the United States with US$6.8 billion (14 percent of world total). Eight other countries each had over US$1.0 billion in imports: France, $2.9 billion; Spain, $2.8 billion; Germany, $2.2 billion; Italy, $2.2 billion; United Kingdom, $1.8 billion; Hong Kong, $1.6 billion; Denmark, $1.4 billion and the Netherlands, $1.0 billion. The influence of Japan makes Asia the leading fish importing region, followed by Europe and North America (Table 1). Excluding Japan, the rest of the countries in Asia together import only US$6.1 billion. It is also interesting to note that the lowincome food deficit countries import only 3.6 percent of the fish worldwide and export 17.9 percent. Fish are clearly a source of hard currency for many low-income food deficit countries. Finally, the importance of organized trading blocs and arrangements can again be seen from these data. As a group, the members of the European Community are the leading fish importing bloc in the world, with 33.7 percent of total imports. Japan is second at 31.8 percent with the loose confederation of NAFTA counties third at 15.6 percent.
SEAFOOD-BORNE DISEASE AND ILLNESS.
Responsibility for the collection and recording of data on disease and illness when seafood is implicated on a worldwide basis is spread among a large number of agencies across many countries. Even within countries, multiple agencies or organizations are often involved. In Europe, data on food-borne illnesses is collected and reported by member country participants of the European World Health Organization (WHO) Surveillance Programme for Control of Food-borne Infections and Intoxication's (FAO/WHO 1995, 1992, 1990). The quality and detail of the data are dependent on each reporting member country. For the European Union, all member countries participate, with the most complete data for seafood-borne disease and illness reported by Denmark, Finland, Germany, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom. The European Union has also initiated a Rapid Alert System for food. This system is used to notify all member countries of the European Union when any member country detects unsafe food products. The food product, the cause of the danger and the country of origin are reported. In the United States, the major sources of information on seafood-borne disease and illness are the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Food-borne Disease Outbreak Surveillance Program and a data base on shellfish-associated food-borne cases maintained by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Northeast Technical Support Unit. The CDC data are derived from reports of food-borne outbreaks.
-5submitted by state health departments to the CDC. The FDA data come from books, news accounts, CDC reports, city and state health department files, Public Health Service regional files, case histories and archival reports (Ahmed 1991). Seafoodborne illness data for Japan are published annually by the Veterinary Sanitation Division, Environmental Health Bureau, Ministry of Health and Welfare, as part of the annual statistics for all food-borne illnesses. The number of incidents (outbreaks), patients (cases), and deaths are recorded (Japan Ministry of Health and Welfare 19871996). Data for Canada are collected by the Fish Inspection Directorate, Canadian Food Inspection Agency, Government of Canada. The data report annually the cause of illness, description of product causing the illness, product type, country of origin and the numbers of incidents and cases. Seafood-borne disease and illnesses reported by each reporting area or system represent the minimum number of actual seafood-borne cases that occur. It is highly likely that many seafood-borne illnesses (like all food-borne illnesses) are not reported by the patient nor recognized as a food-borne illness. However, these data collection agencies provide the only reliable sets of data available. 3.1 European Union.
Available data for the European Union (FAO/WHO 1995, 1992, 1990) for those member countries with more complete data usually report the number of outbreaks when fish and shellfish are implicated as the source of the outbreak4. The data reported do not usually attribute the number of cases5 of disease and illness resulting from the outbreaks. Disease or illness outbreaks from fish and shellfish between 1983 and 1992 ranged from 1.9 percent of total food-borne outbreaks in United Kingdom (Scotland) to 12.4 percent in Denmark. When the known food source was identified the range of fish and shellfish outbreaks was from 4.4 percent in the United Kingdom (England/Wales) to 16.1 percent in Finland (Table 2). The Food and Veterinary Office of the European Union has also initiated a Rapid Alert System for food. This system is used to notify all member countries of the European Union when food products are detected that are a source of danger to health. The source of danger and the country of origin are reported. Between 1992 and November 1997, the 71 seafood alerts from this system represented 42.5 percent of all food alerts. Seafood products implicated and the number of the 71 alerts in which each was implicated were: live mussels (14), tuna fish products (9), fish products, oysters, squid, and chilled raw sole (4 each), shrimp, octopus and seafood (3 each), shellfish, crawfish, scallops, cuttlefish, anchovy and frog legs (2 each), and Nile perch, frozen mussels, frozen perch, bivalve molluscs, king prawn, salmon, chilled raw mullet fillets, fish brochettes, canned fish, clams, frozen mussels (1 each).

When the cause of the food-borne illness is known, 18 percent of the outbreaks are from all fish and shellfish sources resulting in nine percent of the cases. Twentysix percent of food-borne illness deaths in Japan are from all fish and shellfish and products of fish and shellfish (See Table 4). For fish and shellfish, most illnesses caused by bacteria are from Vibrio parahaemolyticus at 75 percent of bacterial disease cases. Salmonella, Staphylocococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Clostridium perfringens are the other major sources of illness. For products of fish and shellfish, these same five bacteria are the leading causes of illness but the distribution of cases among the bacteria is more evenly spread (Table 5). Natural poisons and chemical substances rank six and seven among both fish and shellfish-borne diseases and fish and shellfish product-borne illnesses.

A total of 29 different species of fish and shellfish and or seafood products were implicated in seafood-borne illnesses. The top six in number of outbreaks were mussels (13), clams (12), tuna (10), barracuda (5), and marlin (3). These six represented 56 percent of the outbreaks. The top seven in number of cases were tuna (37), mussels (28), clams (20), barracuda (13), lobster tails (12), marlin (9) and oysters (9), representing 76 percent of all outbreaks. All other species or products implicated (one to three outbreaks; one to six cases) were whelk, mahi mahi, mackerel, swordfish, crab meat, salmon, oysters/quahogs, clams and dips, haddock and clams, halibut, sole fillets, sharks, scallops, salmon/shrimp/scallops, pollock, chicken haddie, shrimp, quahogs, kippers and parrotfish/doctorfish. Seafood products causing illnesses in Canada from 1991 to 1997 came from 13 different countries or groups of countries. The top three countries in products causing outbreaks were Canada (40) and the United States (19), representing 76 percent of the outbreaks. Other countries implicated in one to four outbreaks.
- 10 and/or one to six cases were Singapore, Ecuador, Thailand, China, Canada/United States, Peru, India, Cuba, Fiji, Guyana and Trinidad/Tobago. Four outbreaks (six cases) could not be traced to the product source. 3.4 United States.
In the United States, seafood-borne disease or illness reported by the Centers for Disease Control from 1978 to 1987 totaled 558 outbreaks involving 5 980 cases. However, fish and shellfish constituted only 10.5 percent of all outbreaks and 3.6 percent of all cases when food-borne illnesses from all foods are considered. The number of people made ill from beef (4 percent) and turkey (3.7 percent) exceeds the seafood total, whereas pork (2.7 percent) and chicken (2.6 percent) are slightly lower. If fish and shellfish (2.3 percent) and fish (1.2 percent) are considered separately, the number of reported cases from each is lower than for any animal meat product. However, when only muscle foods (red meat, fish, poultry) are consumed, seafoodborne illness represent 56 percent of all outbreaks and 21 percent of all cases when incidents of unknown etiology are included. These data and those following for the United States are available in more detail (Ahmed 1991). From 1978 to 1987, the CDC reported 38 seafood-associated outbreaks (351 cases) related to finfish and other non-shellfish sources. All but three outbreaks were from infectious agents associated with processing and preparing the seafood. Unknown agents caused another 16 outbreaks (203 cases). Forty shellfish-associated outbreaks (476 cases) were reported from known pathogenic sources. Another 88 outbreaks (3 271 cases) were from unknown sources. Forty-nine percent were due to infectious agents generally associated with fecal pollution, and 46 percent were from infectious agents generally associated with processing and preparation. From 1978 to 1987, the NETSU reported 2 198 cases of shellfish-associated outbreaks. Naturally occurring aquatic agents caused 15 percent of the outbreaks and 85 percent were due to infectious agents generally associated with fecal pollution. An additional 5 098 cases could not be associated with a known agent (Ahmed 1991). CDC reported shellfish outbreaks (40 when etiology known) were associated with Vibrio parahaemolyticus (15), Hepatitis A. virus (7), Shigella (4), Salmonella (3), Vibrio cholerae O1, other viral, Non-O1 V. cholerae, Clostridium perfringens, Bacillus cereus (2 each) and Staphylococcus (1). Cases (476 when etiology known) were associated with V. parahaemolyticus (176), Salmonella, non-typhi (80), Shigella (77), other viral (42), Hepatitis A. virus (33), Clostridium perfringens (28), V. cholerae O1 (14), Non-O1 V. cholerae (11), Staphylococcus aureaus (9), and Bacillus cereus (6). NETSU cases (2 182 when etiology known) were associated with unspecified hepatitis (1 645), Non-O1 V. cholerae (120), V. vulnificus (100), Shigella (84), Norwalk and related viruses (82), V. parahaemolyticus (52), Hepatitis A. virus (45), Plesiomonas (18), Campylobacter (16), V. cholerae O1 (13), Aeromonas (7), Vibrio mimicu
