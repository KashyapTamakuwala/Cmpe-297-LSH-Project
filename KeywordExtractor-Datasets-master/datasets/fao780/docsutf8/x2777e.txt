Executive Summary
At the dawn of the 21^st Century, dramatic developments are continuing to transform global agriculture and rural economies. Continued growth in the world population, demands to feed and improve the quality of life of that population, the reach of human influence to the remotest corners of the Earth, direct manipulation of nature at the genetic level, increasing globalisation of the world economy, and the immediacy and profound impact of communication and information technologies are among the most striking examples.
Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, international interest focused on developments in agriculture that could directly address growing concerns about future food security, productivity and sustainability. Thinking crystallised in the 1990s as an approach that became known as "Sustainable Agriculture and Rural Development (SARD)." The SARD approach aims to foster sustainable development (in the agricultural, fisheries and forestry sectors) that "conserves land, water, plant and animal genetic resources, is environmentally non-degrading, technically appropriate, economically viable and socially acceptable."
More recently, a new analytical approach and interpretative framework built on an understanding of the Multifunctional Character of Agriculture and Land (MFCAL) has emerged which helps to capture the complexity and continuing importance of the new agricultural patterns and land-use systems that have emerged throughout the world and assess their relationships with other sectors of the economy and society. The concept of MFCAL has evolved from and builds upon SARD. It encompasses the entire range of environmental, economic and social functions associated with agriculture and related land-use. Analysis of the multifunctional character of agriculture contributes to understanding the potential linkages, synergies and trade-offs necessary to achieve sustainability in agriculture and rural development. The MFCAL approach provides a policy-oriented analytical framework for the achievement of SARD goals.
THE MULTIPLE FUNCTIONS OF AGRICULTURE AND LAND
The first and foremost role of agriculture remains the production of food and other primary goods and contributing to food security. Attaining food security is a complex task which requires an enabling environment and policies that ensure social, cultural, political and economic stability and equity. Combining the economic, social, and environmental functions of agriculture can help to achieve these goals. Agricultural activity and related land use also result in a wide range of non-food goods and services, shape the environment, affect social and cultural systems and contribute to economic growth.
Agriculture and related land use have several major functions:
The Environmental Function. Agriculture and related land use can have beneficial or harmful effects on the environment. The MFCAL approach can help to identify opportunities to optimise the linkages between agriculture and the biological and physical properties of the natural environment. It is relevant to a number of critical global environmental problems including biodiversity, climate change, desertification, water quality and availability, and pollution.
The Economic Function. Agriculture remains a principal force in sustaining the operation and growth of the whole economy, even in highly industrialised countries. Valuation of the various economic functions requires assessment of short, medium and long-term benefits. Important determinants of the economic function include the complexity and maturity of market development and the level of institutional development.
The Social Function. The maintenance and dynamism of rural communities is basic to sustaining agro-ecology and improving the quality of life (and assuring the very survival) of rural residents, particularly of the young. On another level, the capitalisation of local knowledge and the forging of relationships between local and external sources of expertise, information and advice are fundamental to the future of existing rural communities. Social viability includes maintenance of the cultural heritage. Societies still identify intensely with their historical origins in agrarian communities and rural lifestyles.
The three functions are clearly inter-related. Their relative importance depends on strategic choices at the local and national levels. The multiple functions may be relevant at many scales, from local, through national and regional, to global. Different functions and their implications may operate over different time horizons - indeed some innovations and transformations may have short-term disadvantages, such as lower productivity, before leading to longer-term, overall economic and environmental benefits. At a further level of complexity, multiple functions may generate various impacts that vary in time and space. Informed decision-making requires a transparent assessment of the advantages of possible synergies as well as trade-offs between options for agriculture and land.
For example, in an industrialised country with established industries, increasing emphasis on the service economy and a small rural population, a local agricultural system can still have multiple functions. In a mountainous region, seasonal crops continue to have economic value for food and fodder, while animal husbandry can furnish a variety of goods. The landscape has value as a place of leisure and recreation for visitors from near and far. The watershed has an environmental function to maintain water quality and quantity, and prevent downstream erosion. Forested areas provide gathered products, timber and benefits to the air and soil. Finally, the continuing vitality of the overall rural economy preserves the common cultural heritage and guarantees the availability of labour for managing natural resources. Choices about land use and employment generation involve striking a balance between short and longer-term economic benefits, and considerations of scale in land use -
changes at the top of a watershed can affect activities and resources far downstream.
In a developing country, agriculture may remain central to the economy as a source of goods for national consumption and processing, and for trade, as raw materials and finished goods. The employment of much of the population is tied mainly to these activities, but also extends to management of local resources that affect the environment. The economic function also extends to the longer-term care and sustainable use of natural resources, and increasingly to other activities such as cottage industries and tourism. Decisions on investment in new forms of land use involve striking a balance between short and long-term costs and benefits (for example, immediate revenue for export crops as compared to loss of natural habitats and their capacities), and considerations of the social implications of some developments (for example, the conversion of smallholder fields to large-scale plantation, mechanised or irrigated agriculture).
A CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK
Although agriculture and related land use have long been recognised as inherently multifunctional, the paper proposes a new, coherent framework for the comparative assessment and valuation of the multiple functions in order to achieve sustainability in agriculture and rural development. The framework charts relationships between the market, institutional, and geographic and resource-based aspects of multifunctional agriculture. Dimensions of space, scale and time can be incorporated. Regions with different characteristics can be located within this framework, to assist in the development of optimal policies which take local circumstances and preferences into account. A general relationship is postulated between the development of institutional capacity and the potential contribution of multifunctional agriculture and land use to sustainable development.
Use of the conceptual framework in the light of case studies allows three conclusions to be drawn for further empirical confirmation:
* in environmental terms, the multifunctional character of agriculture and land is used to a lesser degree when natural resources are more abundant and the cultivated ecosystems are resilient; multiple functions are relied upon to a greater degree when the environment has limited potential;
* in economic terms, the multifunctional character is used more when structures associated with the market economy are present and work satisfactorily, which entails sound functioning in parallel of public institutions and mechanisms for decision-making;
* in social terms, the multifunctional character can be optimised when information flow between stakeholders at all levels is direct and transparent.
THE WAY FORWARD
Our understanding of the factors crucial to achieving greater sustainability in agriculture has increased through building on the potential scope of multiple functions in rural areas. This requires the involvement of all stakeholders and effective mechanisms to co-ordinate action and make decisions, collaborating with other actors at the local level and from civil society. Residents of rural communities, in particular farmers, continue to play a central role as stewards of agricultural land and the environment. An appreciation of their vital contribution has progressively permeated government and private agencies in urbanised, industrialised and developing countries. However, ultimate responsibility for ensuring the viability of agricultural systems and the environment remains in the public arena, and there must be mechanisms for addressing competing interests, immediate needs and conditions for long-term sustainability that take proper account of the general goals of equity
and poverty reduction.
Possible domains of action include:
* More public and private sector research would help to develop more productive, environmentally friendly and equitable agriculture allowing for more sustainable management of natural resources (water, soils, biodiversity). Organisations with appropriate technical and scientific expertise can assist governments and stakeholders with the tools needed to optimise the potential of the multiple functions of agriculture and land.
* at national levels can channel revenues towards food security and production in countries where agriculture is the main sector, help to match labour supply coming from agriculture with the urban capacity for labour, and progressively decentralise responsibility for management and planning as local institutions become stronger.
* Market forces can be an incentive for sound resource management and best use of the diverse functions of agriculture, given the absence of market imbalances, conditions of fairness and equity, freedom of association and action, and transparency in transactions.
Processes at the National and International Levels
The ability to distinguish the functions of agriculture in precise contexts offers insights into possible directions for future policy and activities. Contribution to the overall objective of sustainable development encompasses improving food security and strengthening the synergies between the environmental, economic and social functions of agriculture and related land use. National priorities and processes for establishing these priorities will vary, and choices between options will depend on public decision-making processes. National bodies for governance and management will continue to shoulder the primary responsibility for arriving at and executing such decisions.
Regional and international bodies will play an increasing role in formulating joint policies that focus on comparative advantages for trade and development, with explicit social goals affecting equity and gender issues and access to resources. Perhaps the greatest challenge to the development of sustainable agriculture and related land use is to reconcile the primary objective of achieving food security with environmental objectives. Both have an inherently international character. The Commission on Sustainable Development (CSD) process offers a common venue to recognise the enduring and irreplaceable role of agriculture for the future, building on possible synergies between the environment and different sectors of economy and society.
However, this may not be sufficient. There is a need to collaborate on ways forward that combine global mechanisms and institutions that are responsible for all dimensions of land use. The relevant mechanisms and institutions also encompass macro-economy, public policy and overall planning. Initiatives must also be developed in the context of the many relevant Conventions regulating international concerns about the environment, commerce and society.
Particular areas of continuing concern for the future include:
* influencing public awareness in societies that are still dependent on, but no longer have roots or practical experience in the countryside;
* developing better understanding of the dramatic transformations in human relations to agriculture and the environment;
* achieving greater social equity and increasing opportunities for rural societies.
Distinguishing the environmental, economic and social functions of agriculture and land already add significantly to appreciation of changes in the traditional role of agriculture. Further progress towards sustainability will require closer collaboration between institutions responsible for agriculture and land use, the economy, public policy and overall planning. As a neutral platform for international debate, FAO will continue to dedicate its efforts to issues critical to the future of food and agriculture.

Chapter 1
Introduction
The relationships between human society and the land have been progressively transformed as a result of dramatic changes in the course of the 20^th Century, particularly by increasing industrialisation, the mechanisation of agriculture, immediacy in global trade and communication, rapid increases in population size and densities, and the expanding use of biotechnologies. National, regional and international perspectives on agriculture must examine these and other factors in order to provide the best possible basis for allocating resources, establishing rules, formulating policy and making decisions. The emerging awareness that agriculture contributes in many varied forms to societal goals leads to a need for better understanding of the "multiple functions of agriculture." Other economic activities have strong relationships to land use, but agriculture also has unique social and environmental dimensions.
The first and foremost function of agriculture remains to provide food security, defined by FAO as "the access for all people at all times to enough food for an active, healthy life." The 1996 World Food Summit emphasised access to sufficient and adequate food as a universal human right. Clearly permanent availability, reliability of supply, relative autonomy, and population access and equity are all critical issues.
In addition to producing food, agriculture also produces a wide range of non-food goods and services, shapes the environment, affects social and cultural systems and contributes to economic growth. All these functions of agriculture can contribute to the achievement of sustainable development.
But agriculture also presents major challenges to sustainable development, among which the most important are:
* pollution, contributions to the greenhouse effect, depletion of water sources, erosion and degradation of soils and reduced biodiversity;
* damage to ecologically fragile areas, and in some cases destruction of entire ecosystems, as a result of more intensive and extensive agriculture driven by economic development and demographic growth, resulting in increasing food requirements;
* pressures on fragile or precarious rural livelihoods, with people unable to live off their land, migrating to other regions at the risk of increasing competition for land, increasing pressure on natural resources, and land tenure conflicts, contributing in turn to problems of urbanisation as well as to social and military conflict.
FAO and other institutions focused attention in the 1970s and 1980s on emerging developments in agriculture that could address concerns about future food security, productivity and sustainability. Thinking was crystallised as an approach to "Sustainable Agriculture and Rural Development (SARD)," with the principal characteristics being that "such sustainable development (in the agricultural, fisheries and forestry sectors) conserves land, water, plant and animal genetic resources, is environmentally non-degrading, technically appropriate, economically viable and socially acceptable." Significant accomplishments have included support to improvements in farm-level information, technology and organization as well as a better understanding of the linkages between rural areas and external institutional and commercial forces.
Evolving from SARD, the concept of the Multifunctional Character of Agriculture and Land (MFCAL ) is defined as the entire range of associated environmental, economic and social functions of agriculture. The concept encompasses all the multiple goods and services generated by agriculture and related land-use. Analysis of the multifunctional character contributes to understanding the combination of potential synergies and trade-offs necessary to achieve sustainability in agriculture and rural development.
The concept of multiple functions captures the complexity, scope and significance of this wide range of inter-relationships and interactions between the agricultural sector (assumed to include forestry and fish farming) and the environmental, economic and social domains, helping to describe and understand the multiple and often combined functions of agriculture. A multifunctional analysis can furnish a description of current conditions and sufficient information to determine the likely impacts of specific actions. The approach can thus inform discussion on critical issues such as trade, food security, biodiversity and rural employment and help to identify potential synergies and trade-offs and formulate better policies to achieve the ultimate goal of sustainability in agriculture within the related resource base.
This paper covers MFCAL concepts, issues and policies. Along with the accompanying Taking Stock Paper and six Background Papers, the paper constitutes the principal input to the FAO/Netherlands Conference on the Multifunctional Character of Agriculture and Land at Maastricht in the Netherlands from 12-17 September 1999. The Conference is expected to contribute to the Eighth Session of the United Nations Commission on Sustainable Development (CSD-8), which will take place in April, 2000, by assessing progress in terms of success stories, contributing factors, best practices and lessons learned, and determine how best to continue progress towards implementing Agenda 21 globally in the next century.
The overall objective of the Conference is to identify the new practices and the necessary enabling environments that will lead to increased agricultural sustainability. Its particular emphasis is on raising international, national and local awareness of the range, diversity and positive potential of the multiple contributions that agriculture and related land use can make to improving both food security and sustainability in the broad sense.
The principal tasks of the Conference are to:
* review progress, in the context of agriculture and related land use, towards the principles contained in the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development and Agenda 21: Programme of Action for Sustainable Development;
* identify the main issues to be addressed, taking into consideration the continually evolving nature of agriculture and related land use.
The context for the Conference and this series of input papers is set out in the boxes below.

Principle 3
The right to development must be fulfilled so as to equitably meet developmental and environmental needs of present and future generations.
Principle 4
In order to achieve sustainable development, environmental protection shall constitute an integral part of the development process and cannot be considered in isolation from it."
Principle 5
All States and all people shall cooperate in the essential task of eradicating poverty as an indispensable requirement for sustainable development, in order to decrease the disparities in standards of living and better meet the needs of the majority of the people of the world.
Principle 8

BOX 2: THE ROME DECLARATION ON WORLD FOOD SECURITY
"Convinced that the multifaceted character of food security necessitates concerted national action, and effective international efforts to supplement and reinforce national action, we make the following commitments:
* we will ensure that an enabling political, social, and economic environment designed to create the best conditions for the eradication of poverty and for durable peace, based on full and equal participation of women and men, which is most conducive to achieving sustainable food security for all;
* we will implement policies aimed at eradicating poverty and inequality and improving physical and economic access by all, at all times, to sufficient, nutritionally adequate and safe food and its effective utilization;
* we will pursue participatory and sustainable food, agriculture, fisheries, forestry and rural development policies and practices in high and low potential areas, which are essential to adequate and reliable food supplies at the household, national, regional and global levels, and combat pests, drought and desertification, considering the multifunctional character of agriculture;
* we will strive to ensure that food, agricultural trade and overall trade policies are conducive to fostering food security for all through a fair and market-oriented world trade system;
* we will endeavour to prevent and be prepared for natural disasters and man-made emergencies and to meet transitory and emergency food requirements in ways that encourage recovery, rehabilitation, development and a capacity to satisfy future needs;
* we will promote optimal allocation and use of public and private investments to foster human resources, sustainable food, agriculture, fisheries and forestry systems, and rural development, in high and low potential areas;
* we will implement, monitor, and follow-up this Plan of Action at all levels in co-operation with the international community.
We pledge our actions and support to implement the World Food Summit Plan of Action."
The next chapter of this paper describes the MFCAL concept and its origins and sets out the main relationships and interactions between agriculture and related land use and the environmental, economic, social and cultural domains, both in terms of benefits and challenges. Chapter 3 discusses the findings of the series of case studies presented in the Taking Stock Paper and uses these to illustrate particular features of the concept of the multifunctional character of agriculture. This is followed by a chapter describing a conceptual framework which charts the complex sets of relationships and interactions in terms of geographical dimensions, such as the locations of agricultural potential and resilience, and institutional dimensions, such as the levels of development of markets, institutions and public capacity. The final chapter looks at possible ways forward, in terms of the actions, collaboration and partnerships needed to realise the potential contribution of MFCAL and
other relevant concepts to the achievement of sustainability.
Together, the Issues and the Taking Stock Papers provide a broad, integrated and thematically coherent examination of MFCAL issues for the benefit of policy-makers, technicians, practitioners and other interested parties. The analysis seeks to inform and guide but not prescribe national and international policies and actions.

The MFCAL Concept
2.1 THE MULTIFUNCTIONAL CHARACTER OF AGRICULTURE AND LAND
Previous approaches to agriculture and related land-use issues have developed sophisticated tools that help to understand the complexity and diversity of rural areas. Since the Den Bosch Conference in 1991 and the Rio Summit in 1992, proponents of "Sustainable Agriculture and Rural Development" (SARD) have developed a comprehensive view of topics including rural extension and research, science and technology, infrastructure, human capital and sustainable livelihoods. SARD encompasses a wide range of economic, socio-cultural and environmental questions related to agriculture.
The concept of multiple functions builds on these previous approaches by:
* widening focus to include services from the agricultural sector to society as a whole;
* providing a framework for comparative appreciation of trade-offs and synergies between the different functions of agriculture and related land use;
* examining the dynamic relationships between rural and urban areas at different scales;
* incorporating the global range of conditions, from predominantly rural societies with emphasis on primary production for food or other goods, to highly industrialised nations with a small rural population and limited importance attributed to primary production in the national economy.
Thus the concept facilitates understanding of the complex interactions between agriculture and related land use, the multiple goods and services (food and non-food) produced by agriculture, the contribution that these goods and services make to the achievement of wider societal goals, and, in turn, the impacts on agriculture of the environmental, economic and social domains, including demography and the increasing globalisation of markets and trade.
While the multifunctional character of agriculture is intrinsic, the agenda for food and agriculture has only recently started to focus on the policy challenges relating to reinforcing a range of functions.
* From the 1950s to the late 1970s, the primary focus in agricultural policy was increasing food supplies. There was an evolution in approaches starting with the Green Revolution but later broadening to farming systems approaches, participation, attention to gender, etc.
* During the early 1980s, the dimension of food security was added to the policy agenda, based on the recognition that access to food was as essential as food supply in achieving household and national food security. It was also increasingly recognised that strong policy and institutional support systems were a necessary complement to technologies for agricultural development.
* In the late 1980s and early 1990s, increasing concern over the environment was accompanied by greater policy commitment to sustainable agriculture. Concern was first expressed in developed countries but was also embraced in lower income countries within the broader framework of sustainable agriculture and rural development.
After nearly a decade of focusing on a sustainable agriculture agenda, there has been some progress in translating sustainable agriculture concepts and priorities into practice. However, resource managers need appropriate incentives if greater use is to be made of sustainable practices. The incentive structures should offer farmers opportunities and interests which go well beyond agriculture and subsistence food production. Increasing understanding of the many opportunities and constraints affecting success in improving sustainability underlies the present concern with a broader policy agenda for food and agriculture.
A broadening of the policy agenda also arose from a reassessment, in many countries and regions, of the role of agriculture in economic development. In different contexts and for quite divergent reasons, there is increasing policy awareness of the continuing role of agriculture and land in development for low-income and high-income countries in all regions.
* In Africa, the contribution of agriculture to meeting food needs for contributing to economic development has been a major global concern for at least two decades. Agriculture continues to be an essential sector for development, even apart from food production. With few prospects for rapid industrialisation, most African countries will continue to rely on agriculture as an engine of development for the foreseeable future.
* In Asia, there were high expectations that agriculture would play a declining role in national development as countries rapidly industrialised. With the Asian economic crisis, many countries are reconsidering the role that agriculture can play in meeting domestic consumption requirements, providing agro-industrial inputs, and serving as a cushion for rural employment. Agriculture can play the role of an economic "buffer" in times of crisis for employment and food supply.
* In Latin America, critical issues are the vertical integration of agriculture and the shift in sectoral composition from primary production to agro-industries, for which Latin American countries have a long-term comparative advantage. At the same time, countries continue to have dual-sector agricultural economies with large pockets of resource-poor farmers and rural poor who need better and more secure land-based livelihoods.
* In Eastern and Central Europe, a dominant focus of agricultural policy during the past decade has been dealing with privatisation and preparations for entering the EU. At the same time, millions of small family farms are struggling to survive and sustainable agriculture practices remain to many a luxury.
* In Western Europe, North America, the Asian-Pacific Rim and highly industrialised countries elsewhere, relatively few people rely directly on agriculture or land resources. In these countries, priority is given to a complex combination of functions, including food production, environmental, recreational and cultural.
Increasing regional differentiation in agriculture, and associated divergences in developmental goals and priorities, are yet other factors stimulating interest in the specification of mult
