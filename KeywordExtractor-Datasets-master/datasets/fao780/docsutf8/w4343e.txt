<title>Basic finance for marketers (Marketing and agribusiness texts - 1)</title>
<section>1</section>
Preface
This book, Basic Finance For Marketers, was prepared by the project, Network and Centre for Agricultural Marketing Training in Eastern and Southern Africa. The project, funded by the Government of Japan and executed by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, was based in Zimbabwe and ran for five years from May 1990. Its overall objective was to strengthen agricultural marketing training in eastern and southern Africa.
Approach and objectives
This book, is one of a series of texts prepared by the Network and Centre. It is written in a style intended to provide basic, practical knowledge and techniques for marketers, untrained in the discipline of finance and accounting. It is not intended to give an all embracing discussion on the intricacies of the principles of accounting and finance but to provide sufficient knowledge for the marketer to be aware of the financial implications of decision making, and aid in the following activities of marketing:
· an assessment of how well marketing strategy is working;
· an evaluation of alternative marketing activities
· the development of future marketing plans, and
· controlling marketing activities.
The text is kept to a minimum in order to put over the principles in a concise way, but it includes both numerous worked and unworked examples in order to achieve maximum understanding and reinforcement.
The text is primarily designed as a teaching aid for marketing or agribusiness lecturers or trainers and is aimed at undergraduate or diploma students studying agricultural marketing, agricultural economics, agribusiness, management or business studies and certain professional qualifications like the Chartered Institute of Marketing Diploma. It can also be used as material for short courses, as a refresher or basic text for post graduates, for in service training of managers and as a self learning aid.
The learning process
The learning process is assisted within the text through the provision of a number of learning aids. These are:
· Chapter objectives; Each chapter has specific objectives which prepare the learner for the chapter material and outline the learning outcomes.
· Figures and tables; Each chapter is illustrated with relevant figures and tables which illustrate, encapsulate or summarize the text.
· Examples; Each chapter contains examples which serve to illustrate the text and reinforce understanding of the principles.
· Exercises; Each chapter contains both worked and unworked exercises intended to ensure the learner's understanding of both the concepts and the use of practical techniques involved in financial analysis.
· Key terms; Key terms are included at the end of each chapter and are intended to act as an aide-memoire.
· Index; A subject index is included at the end of the text to assist with quick reference.
Additional texts
The text is complemented by an additional set of learning and teaching aids as follows:
· Basic Finance For Marketers - Tutors Manual
This text contains all the exercises referred to in the text together with their solutions.
· Transparency Masters
The Transparency Masters contain a series of full colour overhead transparency masters which include all the subject matter, examples, and their solution in summarised or full format. These can be photocopied and used as additional student notes.

Key terms
Whilst it is not necessary to be a qualified accountant or bookkeeper, a basic understanding of what is involved in financial analysis is essential for anyone in marketing. It is too enticing, and often too easy, to use "blue skies" thinking in planning marketing activities. It is even easier to spend money without fully realising the return one is getting for it. It is behoven, therefore, on marketers, to be more disciplined and analytical in the way they go about planning, executing and evaluating marketing plans and strategy. One way of introducing more discipline into the process is by having a basic understanding of the financial implications of decision making, and how financial measures can be used to monitor and control marketing operations. The purpose of this text is to provide exactly that, and the first chapter deals basically with an introduction to the activities involved in financial analysis.
Chapter objectives
This chapter is intended to provide:
· An understanding of financial analysis in marketing
· An explanation of the various activities associated with marketing financial analysis
· A brief introduction to the various financial analysis methods.
Structure of the chapter
The chapter introduces the way in which financial analysis can be used in marketing, and gives a brief overview of the areas in marketing where a knowledge of finance can be very useful, particularly in helping marketers gauge how well strategy is working, in evaluating marketing research alternatives, developing future plans and in marketing control.
The marketing financial analysis circle
Financial analysis can be used to serve many purposes in an organisation but in the area of marketing it has four main functions:
a) to gauge how well marketing strategy is working (situation analysis)
b) to evaluate marketing decision alternatives
c) to develop plans for the future
d) to control activities on a short term or-day to-day basis.
In effect these four functions comprise what can be called the "Marketing Financial Analysis Circle" (see figure 1.1)
Figure 1.1 The marketing-financial analysis circle
Activities associated with marketing financial analysis functions
For each of the four functional areas where financial analysis is useful in marketing, there are a number of associated activities viz:
a) Financial situation analysis (how well marketing strategy is working)
This involves the study of:
· the study of trends
· comparative analysis
· assessment of present financial strengths and limitations for the whole business, brand or component of the business, e.g. transportation.
b) Financial evaluation of alternatives
This involves the study of a number of factors like the market place, competitors etc., and is used for decisions whether to:
· introduce new products/delete mature products
· expand the sales force or do more advertising
· delete a market operation e.g. close a Dairy Board depot or increase the sales fleet
· move into a new market or markets
· build a new grain depot or silo.
c) Financial planning (projections concerning activities which marketing management has decided to undertake)
Financial planning is used for a number of activities like:
· the introduction of a new range of products
· the forecasting of sales and costs
· market liberalisation.
d) Financial control (actual compared to planned results)
This activity is mainly centered around keeping plans on course.
Methods involved in marketing financial analysis
There are a variety of methods used in each of the four functional areas. Some of these include the following:
a) Financial situation analysis
· Ratio analysis
· Profit and contribution analysis
· Sales and cost analysis.
b) Financial evaluation of alternatives
· Sales and costs analysis
· Break even analysis
· Profit contribution, cash flow analysis, profit projections
· Return on investment
· Return on capital employed
· Sustainable growth rates.
c) Financial planning
· Sales and costs forecasts
· Budgets
· Proforma income statements.
d) Financial control
· Sales and costs forecasts
· Actual results compared to budgets (analysis of variance)
· Profit performance.
What is analysed in marketing financial analysis
Two factors influence the choice of unit of analysis:
a) the purpose of the analysis
b) the cost of the information needed to perform the analysis.
Several possible units can be used in marketing financial analysis and cost or sales data can be used. These units are listed in table 1.1. which is by no means exhaustive. Units can be chosen which suit the particular situation or organisation.

Basic financial analysis methods
These will be expanded on in later chapters, so this section serves as an introduction only.
Use of ratios
Ratios can be used to judge the organisation's "liquidity", i.e. can it pay its bills, its "leverage", i.e. how is it financed and its "activities", i.e. the productivity and efficiency of the organisation. Taking liquidity analysis only, this has a bearing on new product planning, marketing budgets and the marketing decisions. Liquidity analysis is drawn from the balance sheet, e.g.:
Cash
Current
Accounts receivable
Short term debt
Stock
Long term debt
Total current assets
Total liabilities
Property and equipment
Net worth
Other assets
Total assets
Total liabilities and net worth
Current and quick ratios
These are used to judge a firm's short term capacity to meet its financial responsibilities.
(i) Current ratio
ii) Quick ratio
Debt ratios
These are used to measure long term liquidity
This ratio shows the extent of leverage (debt) in total capitalisation.
Profit analysis
Breakeven analysis is a method used to estimate the number of units (volume) or sales value required to make neither profit or losses. In other words, it is the point where costs of production and sales volume are equal.
Sales and cost information are used to calculate the breakeven point. Without getting into the argument as to what constitutes fixed or variable costs, fixed costs are defined as those which do not vary with output e.g. rent, rates, whereas variable costs do vary with increased or decreased output, e.g. labour, materials. Breakeven assumes fixed costs are constant, variable costs vary at a constant rate and there is only one selling price. However, with a higher or lower price, the breakeven point will be lower or higher respectively. Breakeven is calculated by the formula:
By rearranging the formula breakeven costs or sales can be calculated. Note that profit level intentions should be added to the fixed costs as this is a "charge" to the company. Also, if one wishes to recover all new investment (value) immediately it should be added to fixed cost.
Breakeven can be calculated by the formula or by graphical methods. Figure 1.2 shows an example of both.
Figure 1.2 Formula and graphical solution for breakeven analysis
i) Formula
Price/Unit =
Variable cost/Unit =
Fixed costs =
= 65, 000 units (volume)
or $120, 000
Figure 1.2 Graphical solution
Contribution analysis: When performance of products, market segments and other marketing units is being analysed, an examination of the profit contribution generated by a unit is often very useful to management.
CONTRIBUTION = SALES (REVENUE) - VARIABLE COSTS
So, contribution represents the amount of money available to cover fixed costs and the excess available is net income.
For example, suppose a product is generating a positive contribution margin. If the product is dropped, the remaining products would have to cover fixed costs that are not directly traceable to it.
In the example below if X was eliminated, $50, 000 of product net income would be lost. If the product was retained the $50, 000 could be used to contribute to other fixed costs and/or net income (see figure 1.3.).
Gross and net profit margins: Contribution margin is useful for examining the financial performance of products, market segments and other marketing, planning and control units. However, marketing executives should be familiar with the calculation of gross and net profit margins, which is useful to gauge company and business unit financial performance and to budget for future operations. The profit and loss statement is useful for reporting performance to stockholders and to compute taxes. Figure 1.4 gives an example

Financial analysis models
Many models, often computerised, have been developed to aid marketers see the effects on the "bottom line" of a change in an organisation. One such programme is the Dupont Analysis The model allows executives to input data into blank boxes and by manipulating any figure find the resulting outcome. One of the advantages of computer based models is that one can work "backward" or "forward" through the model, setting desired levels of cost or outcomes and calculating the results.
Figure 1.5 Sample printout of the Dupont analysis
Other performance measures
Various other performance measures can be used; these include productivity measures, which, say, for a supermarket would be:
Other measures include inventory turnover:
Budgeting and forecasting
These two activities are essential to marketing planning and are often done via pro forma statements.
a) Marketing budgets
Field sales expense, advertising expense, product development expense, market research expense, distribution expense (trade and administration), promotion expense (trade, consumer).
b) Pro forma financial statement
Annual profit and loss statement, next year pro forma/quarter, current year budget/quarter, last year actual/quarter, annual revision of 5 year pro forma profit and loss statement (expense detail for broad categories).
N.B. In all figures watch for inflation and information gaps (use approximation).
Spreadsheets
Spreadsheets are often used in budgeting and forecasting exercises. Spreadsheets use the memory of a computer as if it were a large piece of paper divided up into a matrix of cells. Into these cells may be entered numbers, text and formulae. The power of these systems is that the data held in any one cell can be made dependent on that held in other cells and changing a value in one cell can set (if wanted) a chain reaction of changes through other related cells. This means that a model can be built in which the effect of changing key parameters may be observed. A term often used to describe spreadsheets is "what if software". It can be used, for example, to evaluate the effect of changing the sales commission rate. Simply entering a new value in the commission rate cell will lead to the automatic re-calculation of all dependent cells. Figure 1.6 shows an example of a spreadsheet used in accounting.

Note: The formatting of the 'cells' to display numerical fields to two decimal places/values for commission in the lower half are found by multiplying the sales figures by 1.5%; totals are stored as the SUM (column or row); the borders showing column letters and row numbers may be omitted.
Spreadsheets are powerful personal decision support tools. In addition, programming facilities such as IF...THEN...ELSE greatly extend the control that may be built into the model.

Key terms
The two principle statements which form a set of accounts are:-
a) The profit and toss account defined as a summary of a business's transactions for a given period.
b) The balance sheet defined as a statement of the financial position of the business at a given date (usually the end of that period).
Other less important statements are the manufacturing account and the trading account. It is absolutely essential to any marketer to understand what the profit and loss statement and balance sheet mean. Both documents are vital, not only to show the corporate health of the organisation, but also as an indication to various shareholders of how well or badly the organisation is performing, as proof to potential investors or lenders for the raising of capital and as a statutory record for taxation and other purposes.
Chapter objectives
This chapter is intended to provide:
· An introduction to the basic principles of the accounting equation
· An introduction to, and the construction of, manufacturing, trading and profit and loss accounts and their use
· An understanding of the principles and construction of a balance sheet and its interpretation
· A detailed explanation of the interpretation of company accounts using ratio analyses and the uses of these.
Structure of the chapter
This chapter is structured in a logical way, building up from the basic tenets of financial analysis - the dual effect and the accounting equation. From this, the chapter looks at the construction of manufacturing, trading and profit and loss accounts and the drawing up of a balance sheet. Ratio analysis is a particularly powerful technique aimed at helping marketers to compare sets of figures over time and between companies. This is dealt with in considerable detail.
The basic principles
All aspects of accounts are governed by these two principles.
a) First principle: Dual effect
Every transaction has two effects, not one, e.g. if a Cerial Marketing Board (C.M.B.) purchases grain it has:
· more stock
· less cash.
If the Dairiboard Company of Zimbabwe sells milk to a retailer, it has:
· less stock
· an amount owed by the customer if he does not pay immediately.
b) Second principle: The accounting equation
The second principle stems from the first. Every transaction has two effects; these two are equal and balance each other. Thus, at any given moment the net assets of a business are equal to the funds which the owner or proprietor has invested in the business.
Net Assets = Proprietor's funds
is the ultimate accounting equation. An explanation of the terms is as follows;
· Net assets are defined as a business's total assets less total liabilities.
· An asset is defined as something owned by a business, available for use in the business.
· A liability is defined as the amount owed by the business, i.e. an obligation to pay money at a future date.
· Proprietor's funds represents the total amount which the business owes to its owner or proprietor. This consists of:
Capital: (amount proprietor invested in the business)
plus
Profits: (funds generated by the business)
or minus
Losses: (funds lost by the business) minus
Drawings: (amounts taken out of the business).
Use of the accounting equation to find profit
We normally arrive at a business's profit or loss by means of a profit and loss account, but where information about income and expenditure is lacking, the accounting equation can be a useful way of finding profit. If:
Net assets = Proprietor's funds
then an increase in net assets = an increase in a proprietor's funds.
Considering what causes an increase in the proprietor's funds, we can say that INCREASE IN NET ASSETS (from the beginning of a period to the end) is equal to:
New capital introduced + Profit - Drawings
during the same period. If three of these four amounts are known, the fourth can be calculated.
Manufacturing account
There are many firms, whether parastatal, sole trader, partnership or limited company, which manufacture the final product to be sold from raw materials, e.g. a fertiliser company uses phosphates, ammonia and so on to produce finished fertiliser pellets.
In this instance, a manufacturing account is required in order to arrive at the final cost of manufacture. The manufacturing organisation will still need a trading and profit and loss account. The only major difference is that, in the trading account, the entry for purchases is replaced by the cost of manufacture. The cost of manufacture is calculated using a manufacturing account. Two important factors need to be taken into account:
a) Different types of cost
The costs needed to prepare a manufacturing account can be broken down into two main categories known as direct and indirect costs.
The main or direct costs are those of raw materials and labour which together are known as the prime cost, although any expense which can be traced directly to any unit of production is also a direct cost. The indirect costs are those associated with production but cannot be traced directly to a particular production unit. These costs will include the general factory overheads such as light, heat and power, rent, rates, insurance, depreciation of production machinery, etc. Certain labour costs, such as supervision by foremen or factory managers, will also be indirect costs because they are not directly traceable to a production unit but are absorbed as a general overhead.
b) The effect of stocks
One complication in constructing the manufacturing account is to remember that there may be opening and closing stocks of raw materials and opening and closing values to attach to partly completed items (work in progress).

Trading account
The purpose of the trading account is to show the gross profit on the sale of goods. Gross profit is the difference between the sale proceeds of goods and what those goods cost the seller to buy, or cost of sales. The cost of sales for this purpose includes the amount which has been debited for them to the purchases account plus the cost of getting them to the place of sale, which is usually the seller's premises, i.e. the carriage inwards of those goods.
Preparing a trading account
The trading account is calculated by using a sequence of steps. It is essential that these steps are carried out in the order indicated.
a) The first step is to transfer the balance on the sales account to the trading account:
Dr: Sales A/c
Cr: Trading A/c.
b) Next, debit the trading account with the cost of goods sold, starting with the opening stock:
Dr: Trading A/c
Cr: Stock A/c.
The opening stock is obviously the same as the closing stock of the previous period; in the first year of trading, of course, there will be no opening stock.
c) The balance on the purchases account is then transferred to the trading account and added to the opening stock figure:
Dr: Trading A/c
Cr: Purchases A/c.
d) Transfer any balance on the carriage inwards account to the trading account:
Dr: Trading A/c
Cr: Carriage Inwards A/c.
Add the carriage to the total arrived at in c) above. This gives the total cost of goods available for sale.
e) Deduct the value of closing stock from the cost of goods available for sale. Any item deducted from the debit side of an account is, in effect, credited to the account. Deducting closing stock from the debit side of the trading account is therefore crediting it to that account. The corresponding double entry will therefore be to the debit of stock account:
Dr: Stock A/c
Cr: Trading A/c
(by deduction from the debit side).
We have now arrived at the cost of sales.
f) The balance on the trading account will be the difference between sales and cost of sales, i.e. gross profit, which is carried down to the profit and loss account.
Point to Note:
The debit to stock account for closing stock is the value of the current asset of closing stock which will be included in the balance sheet, as we shall see later. When the opening stock is credited to the stock account in the next period, it will balance off the stock account.
Net sales (turnover) and net purchases: Goods which have been returned by customers are represented by a debit balance on the sales return account. This must be transferred to the trading account, otherwise the sales and gross profit in that account will both be overstated.
Following the same reasoning that allows us to deduct closing stock on the debit side of the trading account, we may deduct the debit balance on the sales returns account from the sales credited in the trading account. In this way, we show the net sales for the year. Net sales are known as turnover. Similarly, we show the credit balance on the purchases returns account as a deduction from purchases in the trading account to show the net cost of purchases. Goods which have been returned to suppliers must not be included in the cost of sales.
Point to Note:
The order of items is most important. Sales returns must be deducted from sales; purchases returns must be deducted from purchases; carriage inwards, if any, must be debited in the account before closing stock is deducted. Figure 2.2 shows a pro forma trading account.

The profit and loss account
Introduction: The remaining nominal accounts in the ledger represent non-trading income, gains and profits of the business in the case of credit balances, e.g. rent, discount and interest receivable. Debit balances represent expenses and losses of the business and are known as overheads, e.g. salaries and wages, rent and rates payable, lighting, heating, cleaning and sundry office expenses. These must now be transferred to the profit and loss account so that we can calculate the net profit of the business from all its activities.
The profit and loss (income) statement presents a summary of the revenues and costs for an organisation over a specific period of time. Such a statement is generally developed on a monthly, quarterly and yearly basis. The profit and loss statement enables a marketer to examine overall and specific revenues and costs over similar time periods and analyses the organisation's profitability. Monthly and quarterly statements enable the firm to monitor progress towards goals and revise performance standards if necessary.
When examining a profit and loss statement, it is important to recognise one difference between manufacturers and retailers. For manufacturers the cost of goods sold involves the cost of manufacturing products (raw materials, labour and overheads). For retailers, the cost of goods sold involves the cost of merchandise purchased for resale (purchase price plus freight charges).
The balance sheet shows that the profit for an accounting period increases proprietor's funds. The trading and profit and loss account shows, in detail, how that profit or loss has arisen. The profit and loss statement consists of these major components:-
· Gross sales - the total resources generated by the firm's products and services
· Net sales - the revenues received by the firm after subtracting returns and discounts (such as trade, quantity, cash)
· Cost of goods sold - the cost of merchandise sold by the manufacturer or retailer.
· Gross margin (profit) - the difference between sales and the cost of goods sold: consists of operating expenses plus net profits
· Operating expenses - the costs of running a business, including marketing
· Net profit before taxes - the profit earned after all costs have been deducted. Figure 2.3 shows a pro forma trading and profit and loss account.
