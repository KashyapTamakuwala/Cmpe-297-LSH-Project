<title>Understanding the Codex Alimentarius</title>
<section>1</section>
PREFACE
The Codex Alimentarius, or the food code, has become the seminal global reference point for consumers, food producers and processors, national food control agencies and the international food trade. The code has had an enormous impact on the thinking of food producers and processors as well as on the awareness of the end users - the consumers. Its influence extends to every continent, and its contribution to the protection of public health and fair practices in the food trade is immeasurable.
The Codex Alimentarius system presents a unique opportunity for all countries to join the international community in formulating and harmonizing food standards and ensuring their global implementation.
It also allows them a role in the development of codes governing hygienic processing practices and recommendations relating to compliance with
those standards.
The significance of the food code for consumer health protection was underscored in 1985 by the United Nations Resolution 39/248, whereby guidelines were adopted for use in the elaboration and reinforcement of consumer protection policies. The guidelines advise that "Governments should take into account the need of all consumers for food security and should support and, as far as possible, adopt standards from the ... Codex Alimentarius" of FAO and the World Health Organization.
The Codex Alimentarius has relevance to the international food trade. With respect to the ever-increasing global market, in particular, the advantages of having universally uniform food standards for the protection of consumers are self-evident. It is not surprising, therefore, that the Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS) and the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) both encourage the international harmonization of food standards. A product of the Uruguay Round of multinational trade negotiations, the SPS Agreement cites Codex standards, guidelines and recommendations as the preferred international measures for facilitating international trade in food. As such, Codex standards have become the benchmarks against which national food measures and regulations are evaluated within the legal parameters of the Uruguay Round Agreements.
The purpose of this booklet is to foster a wider understanding of the evolving food code and of the activities carried out by the Codex Alimentarius Commission - the body responsible for compiling the standards, codes of practice, guidelines and recommendations that constitute the Codex Alimentarius.

The Codex achievement
A SINGLE INTERNATIONAL REFERENCE POINT
Since the first steps were taken in 1961 to establish a Codex Alimentarius, the Codex Alimentarius Commission - the body charged with developing a food code - has drawn world attention to the field of food quality and safety. During the past three decades or more, all important aspects of food pertaining to the protection of consumer health and fair practices in the food trade have come under the Commission's scrutiny. In the best traditions of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the World Health Organization (WHO), as part of its persistent endeavours to develop the Codex Alimentarius the Commission has encouraged food-related scientific and technological research as well as discussion. In doing so, it has lifted the world community's awareness of food safety and related issues to unprecedented heights and has consequently become the single most important international reference point for developments associated with food standards.
GREATER GLOBAL AND NATIONAL AWARENESS
Throughout much of the world, an increasing number of consumers and most governments are becoming aware of food quality and safety issues and are realizing the need to be selective about the foods people eat. It is now common for consumers to demand that their governments take legislative action to ensure that only safe food of acceptable quality is sold and that the risk of food-borne health hazards is minimized. It is fair to say that, through its elaboration of Codex standards and its consideration of all related issues, the Codex Alimentarius Commission has helped significantly to put food as an entity on political agendas. In fact, governments are extremely conscious of the political consequences to be expected should they fail to heed consumers' concerns regarding the food they eat.
INCREASED CONSUMER PROTECTION
The Codex Alimentarius Commission has been supported in its work by the now universally accepted maxim that people have the right to expect their food to be safe, of good quality and suitable for consumption. Food-borne illnesses are at best unpleasant - at worst they can be fatal. But there are other consequences. Outbreaks of food-borne illness can damage trade and tourism and can lead
to loss of earnings, unemployment and litigation. Poor-quality food can destroy the commercial credibility of suppliers, both nationally and internationally, while food spoilage is wasteful and costly and can adversely affect trade and consumer confidence.
The positive effect of the Commission's work has also been enhanced by the declarations produced by international conferences and meetings which have, themselves, been influenced by the Commission's activities. In recent years, national representatives to the United Nations General Assembly, the FAO/WHO Conference on Food Standards, Chemicals in Food and Food Trade (held in cooperation with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade), the FAO/WHO International Conference on Nutrition and the FAO World Food Summit have either encouraged or committed their countries to adopt measures ensuring the safety and quality of foods.
FOSTERING CONSUMER PROTECTION WORLDWIDE
The United Nations General Assembly Guidelines for Consumer Protection
Stated that:
"When formulating national policies and plans with regard to food, Governments should take into account the need of all consumers for food security and should support and, as far as possible, adopt standards from the Food and Agriculture Organization's ... and the World Health Organization's Codex Alimentarius ...".
The FAO/WHO Conference on Food Standards, Chemicals in Food and Food Trade (in cooperation with GATT)
Agreed that:
... "The process of harmonizing national food regulations to bring them into line with inter-national standards and recommendations was an urgent one, which needed to be accelerated ..."
and that:
"Provisions essential for consumer protection (health, safety of food, etc.) should be the focus of emphasis in Codex standards ...".
The FAO/WHO International Conference on Nutrition
Recognized that:
"Access to nutritionally adequate and safe food is a right of each individual."
and that:
"Food regulations ... should fully take into account the recommended international standards of the Codex Alimentarius Commission."
The Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures and the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade
Formally recognized:
International standards, guidelines and recommendations, including the Codex Alimentarius, as reference points for facilitating international trade and resolving trade disputes in international law.
The FAO World Food Summit
Committed itself to:
"Implement policies aimed at ... improving physical and economic access by all, at all times, to sufficient, nutritionally adequate and safe food and its effective utilization."
and to:
"Apply measures, in conformity with the Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures and other relevant international agreements, that ensure the quality and safety of food supply ... ".
BROAD COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT
The role of the Codex Alimentarius Commission has evolved with development of the Codex itself. The task of creating a food code is immense and, because of continuing research and product development, virtually endless. The finalization of food standards and their compilation into a code that is credible and authoritative requires extensive consultation as well as the collection and evaluation of information, followed up by confirmation of final results and sometimes objective compromise to satisfy differing sound, scientifically based views.
Creating standards that at once protect consumers, ensure fair practices in the sale of food and facilitate trade is a process that involves specialists in numerous food-related scientific disciplines, together with consumers' organizations, production and processing industries, food control administrators and traders. As more people become involved in the formulation of standards and as the Codex Alimentarius - including related codes and recommendations - covers further ground, so the Commission's activities are becoming better known and its influence strengthened and widened.
Codex Alimentarius - what it comprises
- Food standards for commodities (237)
- Codes of hygienic or technological practice (41)
- Pesticides evaluated (185)
- Limits for pesticide residues (3 274)
- Guidelines for contaminants (25)
- Food additives evaluated (1 005)
- Veterinary drugs evaluated (54)
A CODE OF SCIENTIFICALLY SOUND STANDARDS
While the Codex Alimentarius as it stands is a remarkable achievement, it would be quite wrong to see it as the only product of the Codex Alimentarius Commission, although it is the most important. Resulting from the creation of the Codex, another major accomplishment has been to sensitize the global community to the danger of food hazards as well as to the importance of food quality and hence to the need for food standards. By providing an international focal point and forum for informed dialogue on issues relevant to food, the Codex Alimentarius Commission fulfils a crucial role. In support of its work on food standards and codes of practice, it generates reputable scientific texts, convenes numerous expert committees and consultations as well as international meetings attended by the best-informed individuals and organizations concerned with food and related fields. Countries have responded by introducing long-overdue food legislation and Codex-based standards and by
establishing or strengthening food control agencies to monitor compliance with such regulations.
The Codex Alimentarius now has such a well-established reputation as an international reference that it has become customary for health authorities, government food control officials, manufacturers, scientists and consumer advocates to ask first of all: What does the Codex Alimentarius have to say? - a notable achievement indeed.

Origins of the Codex Alimentarius
ANCIENT TIMES
Evidence from the earliest historical writings indicates that governing authorities were already then concerned with codifying rules to protect consumers from dishonest practices in the sale of food. Assyrian tablets described the method to be used in determining the correct weights and measures for foodgrains, and Egyptian scrolls prescribed the labelling to be applied to certain foods. In ancient Athens, beer and wines were inspected for purity and soundness, and the Romans had a well-organized state food control system to protect consumers from fraud or bad produce. In Europe during the Middle Ages, individual countries passed laws concerning the quality and safety of eggs, sausages, cheese, beer, wine and bread. Some of these ancient statutes still exist today.
A SCIENTIFIC BASE
The second half of the nineteenth century saw the first general food laws adopted and basic food control systems put in place to monitor compliance. During the same period, food chemistry came to be recognized as a reputable discipline and the determination of the "purity" of a food was primarily based on the chemical parameters of simple food composition. When harmful industrial chemicals were used to disguise the true colour or nature of food, the concept of "adulteration" was extended to include the use of hazardous chemicals in food. Science had begun providing tools with which to disclose dishonest practices in the sale of food and to distinguish between safe and unsafe edible products.
Report of the First Meeting of the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Nutrition, 1950 - an extract
"Food regulations in different countries are often conflicting and contradictory. Legislation governing preservation, nomenclature and acceptable food standards often varies widely from country to country. New legislation not based on scientific knowledge is often introduced, and little account may be taken of nutritional principles in formulating regulations."
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
In the Austro-Hungarian Empire between 1897 and 1911, a collection of standards and product descriptions for a wide variety of foods was developed as the Codex Alimentarius Austriacus. Although lacking legal force, it was used as a reference by the courts to determine standards of identity for specific foods. The present-day Codex Alimentarius draws its name from the Austrian code.

TRADE CONCERNS
The different sets of standards arising from the spontaneous and independent development of food laws and standards by different countries inevitably gave rise to trade barriers that were of increasing concern to food traders in the early twentieth century. Trade associations that were formed as a reaction to such barriers pressured governments to harmonize their various food standards so as to facilitate trade in safe foods of a defined quality. The International Dairy Federation (IDF), founded in 1903, was one such association. Its work on standards for milk and milk products later provided a catalyst in the establishment of the Codex Alimentarius Commission and in the setting of its procedures for elaborating standards.
When FAO and WHO were founded in the late 1940s, there was heightened international concern about the direction being taken in the field of food regulation. Countries were acting independently and there was little, if any, consultation among them with a view to harmonization. This situation is reflected in the observations of international meetings of the time.
CONSUMERS' CONCERNS
In the 1940s, rapid progress was made in food science and technology. With the advent of more sensitive analytical tools, knowledge about the nature of food, its quality and associated health hazards also grew quickly. There was intense interest in food microbiology, food chemistry and associated disciplines, and new discoveries were considered newsworthy. Articles about food at all levels flourished and consumers were bombarded with messages in popular magazines, in the tabloid press and on the radio. Some were correct, some incorrect - but all were intended to absorb interest and many were overly sensational.
Despite the questionable quality of some of the information disseminated, however, the outcome was an increase
in the public's food consciousness and, consequently, knowledge about food safety gradually grew.
At the same time, as more and more information about food and related matters became available, there was greater apprehension on the part of consumers. Whereas, previously, consumers' concerns had extended only as far as the "visibles"- underweight contents, size variations, misleading labelling and poor quality - they now embraced a fear of the "invisibles",
i.e. health hazards could not be seen, smelled or tasted, such as micro-organisms, pesticide residues, environmental contaminants and food additives. With the blossoming of well-organized and informed consumers' groups, both internationally and nationally, there was growing pressure
on governments worldwide to protect communities from poor-quality and hazardous foods.
The problem of food additives
In 1955, the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Nutrition recorded that:
"... the increasing, and sometimes insufficiently controlled, use of food additives has become a matter of public and administrative concern."
The Committee also noted that the means of solving problems arising from the use of food additives may differ from country to country and stated that this fact:
"... must in itself occasion concern, since the existence of widely differing control measures may well form an undesirable deterrent to international trade."
A DESIRE FOR LEADERSHIP
Food regulators, traders, consumers and experts were looking increasingly to FAO and WHO for leadership in unravelling the skein of food regulations that were impeding trade and providing mostly inadequate protection for consumers. In 1953, WHO's governing body, the World Health Assembly, stated that the widening use of chemicals in food presented a new public health problem, and it was proposed that the two organizations should conduct relevant studies. One such study identified the use of food additives as a critical factor.
As a result, FAO and WHO convened the first joint FAO/WHO Conference on Food Additives in 1955. From that Conference eventuated the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) which, more than 40 years after its inception, still meets regularly. JECFA's work continues to be of fundamental importance to the activities of the Codex Committee on Food Additives and Contaminants as well as to the Codex Commission's deliberations on standards for food additives.
The development of food commodity standards in the 1950s*^
- Stresa Convention - Introduced the practice of naming and specifying the composition of particular cheeses
- ECE Committee on Inland Transport - Set quality standards for fresh fruits and vegetables moving in trade in Europe
- FAO and ECE - Set requirements and analytical procedures for determining the purity of fruit juices
- ECE - Set standards for quick-frozen fruits and vegetables
- IDF - Set standards and labelling requirements for milk and milk products
*All the activities listed here have since been taken up by the Codex Alimentarius Commission.
INTEGRATING NON-GOVERNMENTAL ACTIVITIES
While FAO and WHO furthered their involvement in food-related matters, a variety of committees set up by international non-governmental organizations (NGOs) also began working in earnest on standards for food commodities. In time, the work of those NGO committees was either assumed by or continued jointly with the appropriate Codex Alimentarius commodity committees and, in some cases, the non-governmental committees themselves became Codex committees.
A demonstrated need for harmonization
The Codex Alimentarius came into being in response to a widely recognized need. It did not just happen. It was the product of a long evolutionary process involving a wide cross-section of the global community. Many people representing many interests and disciplines were involved in the process, and it is not unreasonable to suppose that, as long as the need perceived by those people remains, so the Codex Alimentarius will remain.
INTERNATIONAL CONSULTATION AND COOPERATION
Two landmark years in the foundation of the Codex Alimentarius were 1960 and 1961. In October 1960, the first FAO Regional Conference for Europe crystallized a widely held view when it recognized:
"The desirability of international agreement on minimum food standards and related questions (including labelling requirements, methods of analysis, etc.) ... as an important means of protecting the consumer's health, of ensuring quality and of reducing trade barriers, particularly in the rapidly integrating market of Europe."
The Conference also felt that:
"... coordination of the growing number of food standards programmes undertaken by many organizations presented a particular problem."
Within four months of the regional conference, FAO entered into discussions with WHO, ECE, OECD and the Council of the Codex Alimentarius Europeaus with proposals that would lead to the establishment of an international food standards programme.
In November 1961, the Eleventh Session of the Conference of FAO passed a resolution to set up the Codex Alimentarius Commission.
In May 1963, the Sixteenth World Health Assembly approved the establishment of the Joint FAO/WHO Food Standards Programme and adopted the statutes of the Codex Alimentarius Commission.

The Codex system: FAO, WHO and the Codex Alimentarius Commission
The Codex Alimentarius Commission was born of necessity.
Its carefully crafted Statutes and Rules of Procedure ensure it pursues its clearly defined objectives in a disciplined, dispassionate and scientific way.
THE COMMISSION
The Eleventh Session of the Conference of FAO in 1961 and the Sixteenth World Health Assembly in 1963 both passed resolutions to establish the Codex Alimentarius Commission. The two bodies also adopted the Statutes and Rules of Procedure for the Commission.
The Statutes provide the legal basis for the Commission's work and formally reflect the concepts behind and reasons for its establishment. Article 1 of the Statutes provides the Commission with its purposes, terms of reference and objectives. Article 2 defines eligibility for membership of the Commission which is open to all Member Nations and Associate Members of FAO and WHO. In 1998, membership comprised 163 countries, representing 97 percent of the world's population.
The Rules of Procedure of the Codex Alimentarius Commission describe and formalize working procedures appropriate to an intergovernmental body. They provide for:
* conditions of membership of the Commission;
* the appointment of Commission officers, including the chairperson, three vice-chairpersons, regional coordinators and a secretary, and prescribe their responsibilities;
* the establishment of an executive committee to meet between Commission sessions, to act on behalf of the Commission as its executive organ;
* the frequency and operation of Commission sessions;
* the nature of agendas for Commission sessions;
* voting procedures;
* observers;
* preparation of Commission records and reports;
* the establishment of subsidiary bodies;
* the procedures to be adopted in the elaboration of standards;
* the allocation of a budget and estimates of expenditure;
* languages to be used by the Commission.
Representation. The Commission is truly an international body. Since it was formed, it has held 22 sessions, with chairpersons from Canada, France, Germany, Hungary, Indonesia, Mexico, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Thailand, the United Kingdom and the United States. Vice-chairpersons have been drawn from Australia, Canada, Costa Rica, Denmark, France, Ghana, Hungary, Indonesia, Iraq, Kenya, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Nigeria, Norway, Poland, Senegal, the Sudan, Switzerland, Thailand, the United Kingdom and the United States.
Regional representatives to the Commission have been provided by the Governments of Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Cameroon, Canada, Cuba, the former Czechoslovakia, France, Germany, Ghana, India, Kenya, the Republic of Korea, Malaysia, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Poland, Senegal, Thailand, Tunisia, the United Kingdom, the United States and the former USSR.
The Commission meets every two years, alternately at FAO headquarters in Rome and at WHO headquarters in Geneva. Plenary sessions are attended by as many as 500 people. Representation at sessions is on a country basis. National delegations are led by senior officials appointed by their governments. Delegations may, and often do, include representatives of industry, consumers' organizations and academic institutes. Countries that are not yet members of the Commission sometimes attend in an observer capacity.
A number of international governmental organizations and international NGOs also attend in an observer capacity. Although they are "observers", the tradition of the Codex Alimentarius Commission allows such organizations to put forward their points of view at every stage except in the final decision, which is the exclusive prerogative of Member Governments.
To facilitate continuous contact with member countries, the Commission, in collaboration with national governments, has established country Codex Contact Points and many member countries have National Codex Committees to coordinate activities nationally.
Interest in Codex Alimentarius activities has been growing steadily since the Commission began, and the increasing involvement of developing countries in its work has been a highlight of the progress made as well as a vindication of the foresight shown by the founders of the Commission.
Statutes of the Codex Alimentarius Commission
ARTICLE 1
The Codex Alimentarius Commission shall ... be responsible for making proposals to, and shall be consulted by, the Directors-General of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the World Health Organization (WHO) on all matters pertaining to the implementation of the Joint FAO/WHO Food Standards Programme, the purpose of which is:
(a) protecting the health of consumers and ensuring fair practices in the food trade;
(b) promoting coordination of all food stan-dards work undertaken by international governmental and non-governmental organizations;
(c) determining priorities and initiating and guiding the preparation of draft standards through and with the aid of appropriate organizations;
(d) finalizing standards elaborated under (c) above and, after acceptance by governments, publishing them in a Codex Alimentarius either as regional or world wide standards, together with international standards already finalized by other bodies under (b) above, wherever this is practicable;
(e) amending published standards, after appropriate survey in the light of developments.
The purposes or objectives embraced by Article 1 resulted from a long process of fashioning and refining. Based on a deep insight into and understanding of events that led to the Commission's establishment, they encapsulate the intentions of the Commission's founders.
Who comes to Codex?
THE COMMISSION'S OPERATIONS
Compiling the Codex Alimentarius
As stated in Article 1 of the Commission's statutes, one of the principal purposes of the Commission is the preparation of food standards and their publication in the Codex Alimentarius.
The legal base for the Commission's operations and the procedures it is required to follow are published in the Codex Alimentarius - procedural manual, currently in its tenth edition. Like all other aspects of the Commission's work, the procedures for preparing standards are well defined, open and transparent. In essence they involve:
* The submission of a proposal for a standard to be developed by a national government or a subsidiary committee of the Commission.
* A decision by the Commission or the Executive Committee that a standard be developed as proposed. "Formal Criteria for the Establishment of Work Priorities and for the Establishment of Subsidiary Bodies" exist to assist the Commission or Executive Committee in their decision-making and in selecting or creating the subsidiary body to be responsible for steering the standard through its development.
* The preparation of a proposed draft standard is arranged by the Commission Secretariat and circulated to Member Governments for comment.
* Comments are considered by the subsidiary body that has been allocated responsibility for the development of the proposed draft standard, and this subsidiary body may present the text to the Commission as a draft standard.
* If the Commission adopts the draft standard, it is sent to governments a number of times in a step procedure which, if completed satisfactorily, results in the draft becoming a Codex standard. In an accelerated procedure, the number of steps required for the development of a standard varies from a maximum of eight to a minimum of five. In some circumstances, steps may be repeated. Most standards take a number of years to develop.
* Once adopted by the Commission, a Codex standard is added to the Codex Alimentarius.
A "Format for Codex Commodity Standards and their Content" is provided by the General Principles of the Codex Alimentarius. It includes the following categories of information:
* Scope - including the name of the standard;
* Description, essential composition and quality factors - defining the minimum standard for the food;
* Food additives - only those cleared by FAO and WHO may be used;
* Contaminants;
* Hygiene and weights and measures;
* Labelling - in accordance with the Codex General Standard for the Labelling of Prepackaged Foods;
* Methods of analysis and sampling.
In addition to commodity standards, the Codex Alimentarius includes general standards, which have across-the-board application to all foods and are not product-specific. There are general standards or recommendations for:
* food labelling;
* food additives;
* contaminants;
* methods of analysis and sampling;
* food hygiene;
* nutrition and foods for special dietary uses;
* food import and export inspection and certification systems;
* residues of veterinary drugs in foods;
* pesticide residues in foods.
Revision of Codex standards. The Commission and its subsidiary bodies are committed to revision of Codex standards and related texts as necessary to ensure they are consistent with and reflect current scientific knowledge. Each member of the Commission is responsible for identifying and presenting to the appropriate committee any new scientific and other relevant information that may warrant revision of existing Codex standards or related texts. The procedure for revision follows that used for the initial preparation of standards (outlined at the beginning of this section).
