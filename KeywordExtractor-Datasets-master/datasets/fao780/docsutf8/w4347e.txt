<title>Irrigation potential in Africa: A basin approach</title>
<section>1</section>
Foreword
Irrigation is viewed as a key factor in progress towards achieving food security in Africa. While nearly 40% of the world's agricultural production comes from irrigated land, the figure for sub-Saharan Africa is only 10%. For most countries of the region, including some poorly endowed with water, only a small part of the available water is withdrawn for use, owing to the state of underdevelopment of water management infrastructure.
Assessment of irrigation potential is of prime importance for planning of sustainable food production in the continent. Considerable information on irrigation potential exists in the African countries, but because of the large numbers of international rivers the regional dimension of the African water resources requires an approach ensuring consistency both within the country and among countries within each river basin.
The present study combines a review of existing information on irrigation potential by country with an approach using a geographic information system to assess land and water availability for irrigation on the basis of river basins. The ever-present environmental issues related to water management highlight some of the major challenges to irrigation development on the continent.
The results of this study and the methodology developed in the report should be useful to researchers and planners at national and regional levels for work aiming at sustainable water resources development in Africa.

Chapter 1: Introduction
There is growing concern about food security in Africa and especially in sub-Saharan Africa. While the aggregate global food supply/demand picture is relatively good, there will be a worsening in food security in sub-Saharan Africa and cereal imports are projected to triple between 1990 and 2020; imports for which the region will not be able to pay. Although the food situation is less severe in north Africa, projections here too indicate increasing cereal imports to 2020 [24].
Africa, with the exception of the Congo/Zaire river basin, is the driest continent (apart from Australia) and suffers from the most unstable rainfall regime. Droughts are frequent in most African countries and each year more people are at risk from the effects of inevitable droughts of greater or lesser severity. Furthermore, Africa's water resources are relatively less developed than those in other regions.
Agricultural productivity per caput in sub-Saharan Africa has not kept pace with population increase, and the region is now in a worse position nutritionally than it was 30 years ago: food production has achieved a growth of about 2.5% per year, while population has risen at a rate of over 3% per year. In the past, additional food in Africa came from increase in the area cultivated, but as good land becomes less available, the region will be forced to increase yields. Both rainfed and irrigated agriculture will need to be intensified, but irrigated agriculture has a higher potential for intensification.
Global estimates indicate that irrigated agriculture produces nearly 40 % of food and agriculture commodities on 17% of agricultural land. At present in Africa, about 12.2 million hectares benefit from irrigation^1, which is equal to only about 8.5% of the cultivated land [21a]. In sub-Saharan Africa, only about 10% of the agricultural production comes from irrigated land. Trends in irrigated land expansion over the last 30 years show that, on average, irrigation in Africa increased at a rate of 1.2% per year. However, this rate began to fall in the mid-1980s and is now below 1% per year, but varies widely from country to country [8].
^1This includes irrigation schemes with full or partial control (11.5 million ha), spate irrigation (0.5 million ha) and wetland and inland valley bottoms, that are equipped for water control (0.2 million ha). Another 2 million hectares benefit from other minor kinds of water management, mainly flood recession cropping (1 million ha) and wetland cropping (1 million ha). In addition, water harvesting methods are becoming more widespread.
While it is true that there still exists considerable potential for the future expansion of irrigation, it is also true that water is growing scarcer in those regions where the need for irrigation is greatest. Over half of the total water withdrawal takes place in the northern, drier part of Africa. Moreover, in this part the withdrawal for domestic and industrial uses will grow fastest, though it will also grow in sub-Saharan Africa in the coming years, as a result of the rapid urbanization.
To enable careful planning of the development of the water resources, especially for agriculture, which is by far the largest water user, a good knowledge of the irrigation potential for the African continent is necessary. This is the subject of the present study.
In the past, several studies have already attempted to assess the irrigation potential for Africa.
In 1987 FAO conducted a study to assess the land and water resources potential for irrigation for Africa on the basis of river basins and countries [20]. It was one of the first GIS-based studies of its kind at continental level. It proposed a natural resources based approach to assessing irrigation potential. Its main limitation was in the sensitivity of the criteria for defining land suitability for irrigation and in the water allocation scenarios needed for the computation of the potential.
In 1995 another study was conducted by FAO as part of the AQUASTAT programme, which is a programme of collection of secondary information on water resources and irrigation by country. A survey was carried out for all African countries, in which information on irrigation potential was systematically collected from master plans and sectoral studies [21a]. Such an approach integrates many more considerations than a simple physical approach to assessing irrigation potential. However, it cannot account for the possible double counting of water resources shared by several countries.
The present study has taken the above limitations into consideration. It concentrates mainly on a quantitative assessment based on physical criteria (land and water), but relies heavily on information collected from the countries. A river basin approach has been used to ensure consistency at river basin level. Where country information was unavailable or incomplete, potential was assessed on the basis of available information on land and water resources at regional and continental level. The FAO Geographic Information System (GIS) facilities were extensively used for this purpose.
A physical approach to irrigation potential must be understood as setting the global limit for irrigation development. Future developments will be dictated by a whole set of factors, including political choices, investment capacity, technological improvement . and environmental requirements.
Chapter 2 of this report describes the methodology and data used for the assessment of the irrigation potential. Chapters 3 to 7 refer to a series of detailed studies conducted in the framework of this study. Chapter 3 summarizes the assessment of the soil and terrain suitability for irrigation. Chapter 4 gives a brief review of the African water resources [21]. The computation of irrigation water requirements is summarized in Chapter 5. The main component of the present study, the review of existing information on irrigation potential by basin and country and its cross-checking with the results of the studies of Chapters 3, 4 and 5, is summarized in Chapter 6. Chapter 7 summarizes some environmental considerations in the development of irrigation, though without presuming to be exhaustive on these complex issues. The general results and conclusions are presented in Chapter 8. Finally, a list of the main sources of information is presented by country.

Review of existing information on irrigation potential
Environmental considerations
Interpretation of the results
This chapter gives an overview of the methodology used for assessing the irrigation potential and of the different steps followed (Figure 1).
Definition of irrigation potential
This study refers to irrigation as the process by which water is diverted from a river or pumped from a well and used for the purpose of agricultural production. Areas under irrigation thus include areas equipped for full and partial control irrigation, spate irrigation areas, equipped wetland and inland valley bottoms (including fadamas), irrespective of their size or management type. It does not consider techniques related to on-farm water conservation like water harvesting.
The area which can potentially be irrigated depends on the physical resources 'soil' and 'water', combined with the irrigation water requirements as determined by the cropping patterns and climate. In this study it is called 'physical irrigation potential'. However, environmental and socioeconomic constraints also have to be taken into consideration in order to guarantee a sustainable use of the available physical resources. This means that in most cases the possibilities for irrigation development would be less than the physical irrigation potential.
Definition of the basic units
Planning for water use can only be carried out on the basis of river basins. On the other hand, land use is usually computed or planned according to political boundaries. These two divisions of the continent were therefore combined to obtain the basic units used in this study.
First, the African continent was divided into 24 major hydrological units or basin groups, the ones defined in the previous study [20], and classified according to four main categories (Figure 2):
o 8 major river basins, draining to the sea: Senegal River, Niger River, Nile, Shebelli-Juba, Congo/Zaire River, Zambezi, Limpopo and Orange;
o 9 coastal regions grouping several small rivers, draining to the sea: Mediterranean, North-West, West, West Central, South-West, South Atlantic, Indian Ocean, East Central and North-East;
o 5 regions grouping several endorheic drainage basins: Lake Chad, Rift Valley, Okavango, South Interior and North Interior;
o 2 units grouping the islands: one unit is Madagascar and the other unit groups the islands of Cape Verde, Comoros, Mauritius, S√£o Tome and Principe and Seychelles.
The last three categories group several small, independent drainage basins in order to limit the study to a workable number of units.
These 24 major hydrological units were combined with the 53 African countries (in GIS) to obtain 136 land units. These units form the basis of all computation and of the information gathered and analysed in this study and are referred to as 'basic units' (Tables 1 and 2).
Identification of the physical resources
Land resources
Water resources
Irrigation water requirements
Land resources
Criteria were established to determine the soil and terrain suitability for irrigation on the basis of the information from the FAO-UNESCO soil map of the world.
The type of irrigation considered was surface irrigation. Introducing sprinkler irrigation or micro-irrigation on a large scale would require a revision of several of these criteria, probably leading to an increase in land suitable for irrigation.
Water resources
In 1995 FAO has conducted a review of the annual renewable water resources of the African countries [21]. These figures were used as a basis for the present study and completed with more detailed information on the variation in water discharges in space and time. This information was compared with surface runoff estimates, calculated for each of the 136 basic units (in GIS) and based on the surface runoff map of Africa [28].
All calculations were based on renewable water resources, and mainly on surface water resources, except for arid countries where renewable groundwater already plays an important role in irrigation development. Non renewable groundwater resources (fossil water) were not taken into consideration. For arid countries, this may result in a relatively low irrigation potential, sometimes even lower than the area already under irrigation.
Irrigation water requirements
Assessment of the irrigation potential, based on soil and water resources, can only be done by simultaneously assessing the irrigation water requirements, which in turn depend on the cropping pattern and climate (rainfall and potential evapotranspiration). For this reason, irrigation cropping pattern zones were defined for current and potential scenarios and water requirements were computed using the FAO CROPWAT model [3]. The climate data used were the ones available on the FAOCLIM cd-rom [7]. From the resulting net water requirements, figures of gross irrigation water requirements (including water losses) were computed for each of the 136 basic units. These figures were then compared with those available from individual country studies.
Review of existing information on irrigation potential
The main component of the present study is the review of existing information on irrigation potential, mainly based on physical criteria, though other criteria are sometimes implicitly included as well, as explained in Chapter 6.
In the framework of the AQUASTAT programme, a library has been created containing all kinds of information related to irrigation and indexed by country: national water master plans, agricultural and/or irrigation sector reviews, project documents, country studies, statistics, etc. All these documents were reviewed for the present study.
In addition, more in-depth research on irrigation potential at country, basin and regional level was conducted in the various FAO libraries and connected information systems.
Two river basins, the Nile and the Niger, were subjected to detailed study, while in view of time constraints the other basins and regions were studied at a more global level. To the extent possible, information was collected for each of the 136 basic units. Where it was impossible to have exact figures at these levels, interpolations and/or estimates were made. All the information gathered from the literature was systematically cross-checked with the results of the studies of Chapters 3, 4 and 5.
This study concentrates on water use for agricultural purposes. Where national water master plans exist, water demand by other sectors (domestic, livestock, industrial, hydropower, navigation, etc.) was taken into consideration in assessing water availability for agricultural purposes. Especially in drier regions, competition for water may arise among the different sectors. In general, the quantity of water available for agriculture is the difference between the total quantity of water available and the water demands of other sectors.
Environmental considerations
The chief concern of the present study is the physical potential. It is impossible to integrate complex issues, like economic, political, social and environmental aspects into a purely quantitative assessment exercise. Nonetheless these issues are critical to a holistic vision of irrigation potential at continental level. The impact of the choice of one or the other land use, for instance, could radically modify the assessment of land which could be allocated for irrigation. A qualitative assessment of the environmental aspects is presented, highlighting the most relevant issues concerning irrigation development, though without presuming to be exhaustive.

Interpretation of the results
After collating all the information, the figures resulting from the country studies were analysed and compared with the figures resulting from the basin studies in order to develop regional tables. The importance of the issue of water sharing between countries emerges clearly from this confrontation.

Chapter 3: Soil and terrain suitability for surface irrigation
General methodology
Results
The evaluation of soil qualities and terrain conditions to predict the performance for specific crops is an essential part of a land evaluation and land use planning exercise applied to agriculture. In the framework of the study, emphasis was placed on the suitability of soils and terrains for irrigation development.
General methodology
Soil requirements for irrigation
Evaluation techniques
In order to compare soil and terrain conditions with specific crop requirements for optimum growth and production, soil and terrain qualities or characteristics, as derived from the FAO - UNESCO soil map of the world [1], were matched against specific crop requirements derived from agricultural experiments and literature review.
Given the small scale of the soil map of the world (1:5000000), the approach to evaluating soil and topography effects is the one used in the continental agro-ecological zones study [16]. This method expresses in a qualitative way, using three suitability classes, the estimated performance and suitability of a given land use type, for specific soil and terrain conditions, assuming climatic conditions to be optimum. It proceeds in four steps:
1. Matching crop requirements with the inherent fertility and physical characteristics of each soil unit in the FAO - UNESCO legend of the soil map of the world.
2. Downgrading, if necessary, the soil unit by a factor which takes account of its texture.
3. Downgrading, if necessary, the suitability class obtained after steps I and 2 for terrain influences, such as slopes.
4. Downgrading, if necessary, for soil phases such as effective soil depth, the presence of gravel and stones, the presence of high levels of sodium, depending on the specific crop requirements in this respect.
Soil requirements for irrigation
Qualitative land evaluation for irrigation is generally based on interpretation of environmental characteristics, of which slope, soil and groundwater are the most important.
The evaluation criteria adopted here consider surface irrigation using water of good quality (Table 3). Accordingly, some soils considered not suitable for such a development could be suitable for sprinkler irrigation or micro-irrigation. It was also assumed that the irrigation infrastructure is in place and that an adequate level of inputs is applied.

(3) Salinity and alkalinity:
The criteria refer to salinity and alkalinity conditions that can be accepted for irrigation and possibly improved by irrigation management. The choice of crops has to be made with regard to the local salinity and alkalinity situation.
(4) Alkalinity:
ESP = Exchangeable Sodium Percentage.
Two main land utilization types have been considered: the whole group of upland crops and rice under irrigation. It was decided that, where the soil is suitable for both upland crops and rice, priority be given to rice. This choice is necessary to avoid counting the same land in both categories, thereby artificially increasing the area suitable for irrigation. This approach differs from the 1987 study [20] where the same land was accounted for in both categories.
The attributes of the FAO-UNESCO Soil Map of the World which were used for irrigation appraisal are: topography, drainage, texture, surface and subsurface stoniness, depth, calcium carbonate level, gypsum status salinity and alkalinity conditions. Criteria were established for evaluating each of these characteristics in relation to the specific requirements for upland crops and flooded rice.
Evaluation techniques
The evaluation of the soil units for irrigation is performed in the same way as the evaluation for rainfed crops [16], namely:
o evaluation of soil units;
o texture modifications;
o slope modifications;
o phase modifications.

Results
Figure 3 shows the detailed map of soil and terrain suitability for surface irrigation per type of crop as a result of the above methodology. Tables 4 and 5 give the extent of suitable land for both types of crops per major basin group and per country respectively. Figure 4 shows the total area of land (rice plus upland crops) suitable for surface irrigation as a percentage of the total area of each of the 24 major basin groups, Figure 5 as a percentage of the area of each of the 53 African countries. As the figures show, the land in the northern part and the southern desert zones is less suitable for surface irrigation than in the rest of Africa.

Summary of environmental impact hazard related to irrigation development
Irrigation has contributed significantly to poverty alleviation, food security, and improving the quality of life for rural populations. However, the sustainability of irrigated agriculture is being questioned, both economically and environmentally. The increased dependence on irrigation has not been without its negative environmental effects.
Inadequate attention to factors other than the technical engineering and projected economic implications of large-scale irrigation or drainage schemes in Africa has all too frequently led to great difficulties. Decisions to embark on these costly projects have often been made in the absence of sound objective assessments of their environmental and social implications. Major capital intensive water engineering schemes have been proposed without a proper evaluation of their environmental impact and without realistic assessments of the true costs and benefits that are likely to result.
The sustainability of irrigation projects depends on the taking into consideration of environmental effects as well as on the availability of funds for the maintenance of the implemented schemes. Negative environmental impacts could have a serious effect on the investments in the irrigation sector. Adequate maintenance funds should be provided to the implementing organizations to carry out both regular and emergency maintenance.
It is essential that irrigation projects be planned and managed in the context of overall river basin and regional development plans, including both the upland catchment areas and the catchment areas downstream.
This chapter reviews the most important environmental issues related to irrigation and drainage development.
Potential environmental impacts of irrigation development
Waterlogging and salinization
Water-borne and water-related diseases
Potential environmental impacts of darns and reservoirs
Socio-economic impacts irrigation schemes
Alternatives to mitigate the negative impacts of irrigation projects
The expansion and intensification of agriculture made possible by irrigation has the potential for causing: increased erosion; pollution of surface water and groundwater from agricultural biocides; deterioration of water quality; increased nutrient levels in the irrigation and drainage water resulting in algal blooms, proliferation of aquatic weeds and eutrophication in irrigation canals and downstream waterways. Poor water quality below an irrigation project may render the water unfit for other users, harm aquatic species and, because of high nutrient content, result in aquatic weed growth that obstructs waterways and has health, navigation and ecological consequences. Elimination of dry season die-back and the creation of a more humid microclimate may result in an increase of agricultural pests an plant diseases.
Large irrigation projects which impound or divert river water have the potential to cause major environmental disturbances, resulting from changes in the hydrology and limnology of river basins. Reducing the river flow changes flood plain land use and ecology and can cause salt water intrusion in the river and into the groundwater of adjacent lands. Diversion of water through irrigation further reduces the water supply for downstream users, including municipalities, industries and agriculture. A reduction in river base flow also decreases the dilution of municipal and industrial wastes added downstream, posing pollution and health hazards.
The potential direct negative environmental impacts of the use of groundwater for irrigation arise from over-extraction (withdrawing water in excess of the recharge rate). This can result in the lowering of the water table, land subsidence, decreased water quality and saltwater intrusion in coastal areas.
Upstream land uses affect the quality of water entering the irrigation area, particularly the sediment content (for example from agriculture-induced erosion) and chemical composition (for example from agricultural and industrial pollutants). Use of river water with a large sediment load may result in canal clogging.
The potential negative environmental impacts of most large irrigation projects described more in detail below include: waterlogging and salinization of soils, increased incidence of water-borne and water-related diseases, possible negative impacts of dams and reservoirs, problems of resettlement or changes in the lifestyle of local populations.
Waterlogging and salinization
About 2 to 3 million ha are going out of production worldwide each year due to salinity problems. On irrigated land salinization is the major cause of land being lost to production and is one of the most prolific adverse environmental impacts associated with irrigation. However, very limited research has yet been conducted to quantify the economic impact of irrigation induced salinization. Quantitative measurements have generally been limited to the amount of land affected or abandoned. Estimates of the area affected have ranged from 10 to 48% of worldwide total irrigated area. Especially the arid and semi-arid areas have extensive salinity problems.
Waterlogging and salinization of soils are common problems associated with surface irrigation
