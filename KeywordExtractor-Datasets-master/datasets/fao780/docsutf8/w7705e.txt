INFORMATION NOTE ASIA-PACIFIC STUDY
At its sixteenth session held in Yangon, Myanmar, in January 1996, the Asia-Pacific Forestry Commission, which has membership open to all governments in the Asia-Pacific region, decided to carry out an outlook study for forestry with horizon year 2010. The study is being coordinated by FAO through its regional office in Bangkok and its Headquarters in Rome, but is being implemented in close partnership with governments, many of which have nominated national focal points.
The scope of the study is to look at the main external and sectoral developments in policies, programmes and institutions that will affect the forestry sector and to assess from this the likely direction of its evolution and to present its likely situation in 2010. The study involves assessment of current status but also of trends from the past and the main forces which are shaping those trends and then builds on this to explore future prospects. Working papers have been contributed or commissioned on a wide range of topics. They fall under the following categories: country profiles, selected in-depth country or sub-regional studies and thematic studies. Working papers are prepared by individual authors or groups of authors on their own professional responsibility; therefore, the opinions expressed in them do not necessarily reflect the views of their employers, the governments of the Asia-Pacific Forestry Commission or of the Food and Agriculture Organization. In preparing
the substantive report to be presented at the next session of the Asia-Pacific Forestry Commission early in 1998, material from these working papers will be an important element but will be blended and interpreted alongside a lot of other material.
Working papers are being produced and issued as they arrive. Some effort at uniformity of presentation is being attempted but the contents are only minimally edited for style or clarity. FAO welcomes from readers any information which they feel would be useful to the study on the subject of any of the working papers or on any other subject that has importance for the Asia-Pacific forestry sector.

ABSTRACT
The objective of the study was to review past trends on the consumption, production and trade for forest products in the Asia-Pacific region, and to project them to the year 2010.
The outlook is based on an analysis of the development of production, consumption and trade in relation to the performance of economies. The first part of the report reviews the historical (1962-1992) developments of consumption, production and trade of detailed forest products in the region. In the second part, a dynamic spatial equilibrium model of the Asia-Pacific forest sector is applied to forecast the future trends (1993-2010).
The review shows that the forest sector in the Asia-Pacific region has expanded greatly in the last three decades. The total consumption of roundwood has nearly doubled between 1962 and 1992, from 593 million m^3 to 1,161 million m^3, while production increased from 576 million m^3 to 1,100 million m^3 over the same period. The Asia-Pacific region has been the world's largest exporter of tropical hardwoods, led by Malaysia with 13.4 million m^3 in 1992. The Philippines and Indonesia were leading exporters in the 1960s and 1970s, but the exports declined significantly since 1980 due to the imposition of log export bans. On the import side, Japan has been the dominant importer of forest products in the region for decades.
The forecasts indicate that the Asia-Pacific demand for forest products will continue to rise, as rapidly growing economies are concentrated in the region. The total roundwood consumption will reach 1,353 million m^3 by the year 2010, an increase of 20% from the 1992's level. Coupled with the rising consumption, production of forest products will reach 1,300 million m^3 by the year 2010. The region's shares of world's total consumption and production are projected to increase from 33% to 35% and from 32% to 33%, respectively, over that period. While Malaysia will still be the largest exporter, exports from New Zealand, Australia, Myanmar and Papua New Guinea will increase. Moreover, Japan will remain the leading importer, even though its domestic production is projected to increase by 12% between 1992 and 2010.
The market equilibrium model underlying the forecasts gives fully consistent forecasts of quantities produced, consumed and traded, within the Asia-Pacific and between the region and the rest of the world. It also provides forecasts of the market-clearing prices. The real prices of industrial roundwood and sawnwood are projected to increase slowly until the year 2010. The real prices of wood-based panels and of paper and paperboard would change little.

Inconsistencies of the data
In some tables of the review of past trends, it will be found that data are inconsistent. For example, the total imports of a country may not be the same in different tables. This is because the data came from different sources, e.g., the trade statistics reported in FAO Forest Products Yearbook and FAO/ECE Timber Bulletin do not always agree. These inconsistencies have been eliminated in the forecasts. Blank entries in tables indicate data not predicted in this study.

INTRODUCTION
The Asia-Pacific region consists of 55% of world's total population, and has the fastest growing economy among all regions in the world for many years. With such demographic and economic dynamics, its forest sector has expanded greatly over the last three decades. The region's total consumption of roundwood has nearly doubled between 1962 and 1992, from 593 million m^3 to 1,161 million m^3, while production increased from 576 million m^3 to 1,100 million m^3 over the same period. Historically, the Asia-Pacific region has been the world's largest exporter of tropical hardwoods, led by Malaysia with 13.4 million m^3 in 1992. The Philippines and Indonesia were leading exporters in the 1960s and 1970s, but the exports declined significantly since 1980 due to the imposition of log export bans. On the import side, Japan has been and will likely continue to be the dominant importers of forest products within the region and in the world for decades.
It is well expected that the economies in the Asia-Pacific region will continue to have strong performance in the decades ahead, and such development will have tremendous impacts on the region's consumption, production and trade of forest products The specific objectives of this study are:
· To summarize and analyze the current status and historical trends of domestic production and consumption in countries of the Asia-Pacific region. Special attention being given to the trade implications of changing domestic consumption and production;
· To identify the main trade flows within the region and between it and other regions, and characterized their trends;
· To identify apparent key driving forces for trade volume, direction, and changes thereof;
· To propose a methodology for projecting developments in international trade flows of forest products with special reference to countries of the Asia-Pacific region; and
· To forecast future trends (till year 2010) of domestic production and consumption in countries of the Asia-Pacific region.
For the purpose of this outlook, the Asia-Pacific region comprises three developed countries and 28 developing countries and territories (Table 1).
Table 2 shows the five aggregated categories and thirteen products considered in this outlook. They are the commodities defined in the FAO Forest Products Yearbook.
The approach for this outlook for forest products in the Asia-Pacific region is first to review the past trends in the development of production, consumption and trade in the region, and then to develop an Asia-Pacific forest sector model. The report is organized as follows.
Part I of this report reviews and analyzes the historical (1962-1992) developments of consumption, production and trade of forest products in the Asia-Pacific region, by country and product. Part II introduces the main methodology used in developing the dynamic spatial equilibrium model of the Asia-Pacific forest sector (ASIA-PAC), describes the countries/regions and the products included in the model, discusses the demand and supply assumptions, and presents forecasts of the future trends (1993-2010) in consumption, production and trade in the Asia-Pacific and the world. The Appendix contains a bibliography of relevant studies cited or useful for future analysis of the region.

Introduction
This outlook study of the Asia-Pacific forest sector provides quantitative information on historical trends and forecasts of forest products consumption, production and trade in and between the Asia-Pacific region and its trading partners.
The main objective of the study is to analyze the status and trends (till the year 2010) of forest products markets in the countries and regions of the Asia-Pacific and related parts of the world, and to propose a methodology for projecting developments in international trade flows of forest products with special reference to countries in the region.
This summary highlights the main findings of the Asia-Pacific forest products outlook study. It covers current status as well as trends. Forecasts are based on assumptions and constraints that can be changed. The data and computer model should enable FAO staff and others to work with different assumptions and thus make their own forecasts.
The forecasts are based on a market equilibrium model. The method insures that the quantity and price forecasts are fully consistent. For each country and commodity, supply (domestic production plus imports) is equal to demand (final consumption, plus input in other processes, plus exports). Imports and exports, by country and destination are balanced, within the Asia-Pacific region and between Asia-Pacific and the rest of the world. Furthermore, the price forecasts for each commodity are such that they clear markets: at those prices, demands are equal to supplies in each country. The availability of price forecasts as well as quantities should be of great value for policy making and project evaluation.
Demographic and Economic Background
The total population of the Asia-Pacific region accounts for more than half of the world's. It has grown from 1.6 billion to 3 billion between 1952 and 1992. China is the most populous country in the region, with nearly 1.2 billion people in 1992, followed by India with 884 million, Indonesia with 184 million, Japan with 124 million, Pakistan with 119 million and Bangladesh with 114 million. While the population of the Asia-Pacific has grown at the same rate as other regions of the world, China's population growth has been quite low since the 1970s, due to the strictly enforced government population control policy.
The Asia-Pacific remarkable economic growth has improved its standard of living significantly. Real per capita GNP grew slowly until the early 1980s. Since then, growth has accelerated. The region's real per capita GNP tripled between 1962 and 1992, from $438 to $1,310, while the world average grew by 75%, from $1,688 to $2,956.
During the 1980s and early 1990s, the economic development in the Asia-Pacific region was characterized by a sharp acceleration of China's economy, significant growth in newly industrializing economies. (Hong Kong, the Republic of Korea and Singapore) and good progress in the transitional economies of Asia. The developing countries' strong economic performance has been helped by sustained domestic demand and export growth as well as by the favourable impact of policy reforms adopted in recent years. Consumer demand remained strong because of significant gains in disposable incomes during recent years. Investment also has grown strongly in many developing countries, reflecting a rapid rise in private investment and in public spending on infrastructure.
Over the last ten to fifteen years, a number of Asia-Pacific countries, including China, the Lao People's Democratic Republic, Mongolia, Myanmar and Viet Nam, have been implementing economic reforms, shifting from centrally planned, state-directed regimes to more decentralized, market-oriented economic systems. In some respects, the liberalization of these transitional economies in the Asia-Pacific is parallel to the changes taking place in Eastern Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States. Many similar issues have to be faced in the reform process, including the design of macro-economic instruments, and the choice of the organization of enterprises. However, in many respects the Asia-Pacific experience is different, because of its long distinct cultures.
As shown in Table 3, the remarkable economic vigour of the Asian-Pacific region continued to be evident in 1994, with a steady growth rate of 7.5% to 8% per year. In this respect developing Asia continued to outperform by a wide margin both other developing regions (4.9%) and industrial countries (2.8%). These growth rate differences may, however, narrow over the next few years, as the developing countries in Africa, the Middle East and Europe as well as the industrial countries are set to improve economic growth performance. But, the fastest growing economies are still likely to be concentrated in the Asia-Pacific. The top developing countries expected to have fastest growth in 1995 were all in the Asia-Pacific region: China, Viet Nam, Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, the Republic of Korea, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, Myanmar and Sri Lanka. The forecast growth rates for those countries ranged from 10 to 6% (United Nations 1995).

Status and Trends of Forest Products Consumption, Production and Trade in the Asia-Pacific Region
The forest sector in the Asia-Pacific region has expanded greatly during the last three decades, and overall trends show a rising production, domestic consumption and trade. As in other parts of the world, the major measurable factors affecting consumption of forest products in the region are population growth and macroeconomic growth, i.e. GNP. However, many other influences are relevant, though hard to measure: level of residential investment, technical and economic competitiveness of sawnwood and panels in the building sector, development in electronic media, competitiveness of paper and paperboard for packaging, etc.
Total consumption of roundwood in the Asia-Pacific has nearly doubled between 1962 and 1992, from 593 million m^3 to 1,161 million m^3. The forecasts show that the Asia-Pacific demand for forest products will continue to rise, as rapidly growing economies are concentrated in the region. The total roundwood consumption will reach 1,228 million m^3 by the year 2000 and 1,353 million by the year 2010, an increase of 20%, from the 1992's level. The Asia-Pacific region's share of world's total consumption is projected to increase from 33% in 1992 to 35% by the year 2010.
Coupled with the rising consumption, production of roundwood also increased from 576 million m^3 to 1.100 million m^3 between 1962 and 1992, and is expected to reach 1,179 million m^3 by the year 2000 and 1,300 million by 2010. The region's share of world's total production is forecast to rise from 32% to 33%, between 1992 and 2010.
International trade in forest products has been and will continue to be an important component in many countries' forest products demand/supply balance, whether they be exporters, importers or, as in many cases, both. In the Asia-Pacific region, the majority of countries import more than they export. But there are a number of major international exporters of tropical timber products.
As seen in Part I, the Asia-Pacific region is a net importer of all forest products except non-coniferous sawnwood and plywood. In 1992, the total imports of solid wood products amounted to 63.4 million m^3, accounting for nearly 8% of total consumption, while imports of pulp and paper products totalled 14.8 million metric tons, about 16% of regional consumption. Among all countries, Japan has been the dominant importer of forest products, mostly industrial roundwood, for decades. In 1992, Japan imported 14.5 million cubic meters of logs and 15.5 million cubic meters of chips, particles and wood residues from countries outside the Asia-pacific, i.e. 64% and 94% of total regional imports, respectively. By the year 2010, Japan will remain the leading importer of industrial roundwood in the region with 84 million cubic meters or 80% of the region's total, even though its domestic production is projected to increase 13% between 1992 and 2010.
While the region's exports of forest products to other countries or regions have been small, the Asia-Pacific region has been the world's largest exporter of plywood, led by Indonesia with 8.6 million cubic meters in 1992, which accounted for more than the total imports of countries outside the Asia-Pacific region. The forecasts for 2010 show that Indonesia may still be the largest exporter with 10 million cubic meters.
Fuelwood and charcoal
Historical trends
Fuelwood and charcoal has been and will still be the dominant use of wood in the developing countries of the Asia-Pacific region. During the last three decades, consumption of fuelwood and charcoal has shown sustained increases, mainly as a consequence of population growth. The region's total consumption increased 83% from 460 million cubic meters in 1962 to 841 million cubic meters in 1992.
Outlook
The total Asia-Pacific consumption is projected to be 930 million cubic meters by the year 2010, a 11% increase over the 1992's level. The top three consuming countries will still be India (282 million cubic meters), China (223 million) and Indonesia (184 million), because of the size of their population (Table 4).

Share
In Japan, New Zealand, Australia and Hong Kong, income increase has had a negative effect on fuelwood and charcoal demand, as the regions shifted their energy sources from fuelwood and charcoal to fossil fuels and electricity. This trends is likely to continue, and the consumption of fuelwood and charcoal in Japan is expected to decrease from 856 to 201 million cubic meters, by the year 2010.
As in the past, most countries in the Asia-Pacific region will continue to be largely self-sufficient in fuelwood and charcoal, and imports and exports will be negligible.
Industrial roundwood
Historical trends
During the last three decades, as a consequence of moderate growth in population and rapid growth in the economy, consumption of industrial roundwood in the Asia-Pacific region has shown sustained increases. The total consumption was 320 million m^3 in 1992, about one-fourth of the world's total (Table 5). Many countries showed steady and strong growth, while some countries had slightly declining trends in the past thirty years (Table 5).
Table 5. Industrial roundwood production, imports, exports and consumption (1000 m^3).
The region production of industrial roundwood was 288 Mm^3 in 1992, 18% of the world's total. The largest producers were China with 93 million m^3, Malaysia with 45, Indonesia with 39, Japan with 28, and India with 25 million m^3. Of these countries, Indonesia and Malaysia registered the highest growth in production, while Japan's production has gradually declined since the 1970s. Viet Nam's production grew fast since the end of the war in 1975, and peaked at 5.4 million m^3 in 1987. Oceania countries, led by Australia and New Zealand, also saw significant increases in production in the 1980s. In contrast to other countries, Philippines' production of industrial roundwood has steadily declined from 13 million m' in 1968 to 3.6 million m^3 in 1992, due mainly to the serious depletion of forests.
The Asia-Pacific region imported 68 million m in 1992, over 60% of the world's total imports. The imports expanded very fast until the late 1970s and peaked at 80 million m^3 in 1979 when Indonesia and Malaysia imposed the bans on log exports.
The largest importers in the region have been Japan with 47 million m^3 in 1992, the Republic of Korea with 10 million m^3, and China with 6 million m^3. Japan is also the world's leading importer of industrial roundwood. Its industrial roundwood imports accounted for more than 63% of domestic consumption in 1992, compared with 20% in 1962, 53% in 1972 and 57% in 1982.
The region exported 35 million m of industrial roundwood in 1992, about 30% of the world's total. Exports increased during the 1960s and 1970s until Indonesia restricted log exports in 1980 and Malaysia in 1985. In the 1980s, Malaysia surpassed Indonesia to become the world's leading exporter of industrial roundwood, with 18 million m^3 in 1992.
More than 51% of the Asia-Pacific imports came from other regions. Its exports went mostly to countries in the same region, primarily to Japan. Exports to other regions accounted for less than 1 % of the total. The top three importers in 1992 were Japan with 25 million m^3, the Republic of Korea with 10 million and China with 5 million. The major suppliers to the region were the United States with 13 million m^3, Russia with 5 million, and Chile and Canada with 1 million. The total imports from these countries represented more than 90 % of all imports from outside the Asia-Pacific region.
Outlook
Over the next two decades, consumption of industrial roundwood in the Asia-Pacific region is expected to rise from 320 million m in 1992 to 365 million in 2000 and 422 million in 2010. This represents an annual increase of 2% between 1993 and 2000 and 1.5% for the 2000-2010 period, keeping the same rate of 1.8% growth for the 1982-92 period and lower than the 3.0% growth during the period of 1962-92. The Asia-Pacific share of the world total will rise from 20% in 1992 to 22% in the year 2000 and 23% in 2010, reflecting faster growth in consumption than the world average in the next two decades.
Most countries within the region are expected to increase their domestic consumption of industrial roundwood. China, Japan and Indonesia will remain the top three consumers. China's consumption will increase from 99 million m^3 in 1992 to 122 million in the year 2010. Consumption of industrial roundwood in Japan is projected to rise nearly 53% between 1992 and 2010, from 75 million m^3 to 115 million. The increase in consumption will most likely occur in the wood-based panels and paper and paperboard sectors. Like China, Indonesia will also experience faster growth, and increase its consumption much by the year 2010. Malaysia and India will also become important consumers of industrial roundwood.
To meet the increasing requirements, production in the Asia-Pacific region will rise, from 288 million m in 1992 to 368 million in 2010. The region's world share will be up slightly from 18% in 1992 to 19% in the year 2000 and 20% in 2010. Among all countries, China will remain the largest producer of industrial roundwood in the region by the year 2010. China is expected to be largely self-sufficient in wood supply, and production is forecast to increase from 93 million m^3 to 121 million in 2010. Over the same period, Indonesia would become the second largest supplier of industrial roundwood, with 46 million m in the year 2000 and 57 million in 2010, a 46% increase over the 1992 level. Malaysia will be the third largest supplier with 47 and 48 million in 2000 and 2010 respectively. The forecasts are consistently higher than the projections of 17 million in 2000 and 20 million in 2010 made by Jaakko Poyry (1992), and 24 million in 2000 and 25 million in 2010 made by Simons
Reid Collins (1995).
Japan is also one of the top suppliers of industrial roundwood within the region. Its production is forecast to increase from 28 million m^3 in 1992 to 29 million in the year 2000 and 31 million in 2010. The supply potential of Japan's plantation forests has been estimated at nearly 66 million m per year if managed for maximum biological yield, which is well over twice that of current production level. If such an increase can be realized, Japan could virtually eliminate its dependence on wood imports. A 1987 study published by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forests and Fisheries, predicted Japan's domestic production of industrial roundwood at 40-43 million m for 1994 and 45-52 million for 2004.
For the Republic of Korea, it is forecast that domestic production of industrial roundwood would decrease slightly between 1992 and 2010.
The total imports by countries in the Asia-Pacific region are expected to rise from 68 million m^3 in 1992 to 94 million in the year 2000 and 105 million in 2010. The expansion of imports would be faster with an average annual growth rate of 2.6% between 1992 and 2000 and 1.1% between 2000 and 2010, compared with 1.9% from 1982 to 1992. The region's world share will, increase slightly from 1992 level of 70% to 76% in 2010.
Japan and the Republic of Korea will still be the top two importers in the Asia-Pacific region over the next two decades. Of the two countries, Japan would almost double its imports of industrial roundwood, while the Republic of Korea's imports would remain stable. China's imports gradually decline. With the projected rising consumption, Japan's imports of industrial roundwood are expected to grow from 47 million m^3 in 1992 to 75 million in 2000 and 84 million in 2010, despite the increasing domestic production. And the share of imports in total consumption will increase from 63% in 1992 to 72% in 2000 and 73% in 2010.
As shown in Table 5, the exports of industrial roundwood from countries in the Asia-pacific region are projected to increase moderately from 35 million m^3 in 1992 to 44 and 51 million in the years 2000 and 2010. The region's share of the world total exports would increase to 37% by 2010. In 2010, the largest exporters in the region are, ranked by volume, Malaysia (18 million m^3), New Zealand (16 million), Australia (8 million), Myanmar (4 million), Papua New Guinea (2.5 million), and China (0.9 million).
Japan will still be the largest importer of industrial roundwood in 2010 with 84 million m, 45% of which will be from countries within the region, and 57% from other parts of the world. Japanese imports will increase by 78% by the year 2010, more than the increase in domestic supply. The United States (16 million m^3) is likely to continue to be the principal supplier of Japanese wood markets, followed by New Zealand (13 million), Malaysia (12 million), Chile (11 million), Australia (7.7 million), Russia (5.3 million), and Canada (2.2 million).
Sawnwood
Historical trends
During the last three decades, the rate of growth in sawnwood world-wide has been slow partly due to substitution by other wood and non-wood materials. Among the products substituting for sawnwood, especially in developed countries, are wood-based panel products - plywood, particle board, and fibreboard, which have grown rapidly in the last three decades. Substitution has been encouraged by two factors: declining prices of wood-based panels relative to sawnwood, and the relative ease with which panels can be installed.
Sawnwood consumption in the Asia-Pacific region nearly doubled between 1962 and 1992, from 53 million m^3 to 105 million (Table 6), an average annual growth of 3%. Its world share dropped from 37% to 24% over the same period. Of the amount in 1992, 55 million m were coniferous sawnwood and 50 million m non-coniferous. The largest consumers were Japan with 38 million m^3, China with 21 million and India with 18 million. The total consumption of those three countries accounted for over 72% of the region's total in 1992.
Table 6. Sawnwood production, imports, exports and consumption (1000 m^3).
The region produced 97 million m^3 of sawnwood in 1992, 84% more than in 1962. During the same time, the Asia-Pacific share decreased from 38% of the world's total in 1962 to 22% in 1992. Of the sawnwood production in 1992, 46 million m^3 were sawnwood and 51 million non-coniferous. The largest producers in the region were Japan, China, India, Malaysia and Indonesia. Of the region's total production, Japan accounted for more than 28%, while China, India, Malaysia and
