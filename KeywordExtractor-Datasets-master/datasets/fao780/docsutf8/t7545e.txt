<title>ADCP/REP/89/37 - A Regional Survey of the Aquaculture Sector in North America</title>
<section>1</section>
FOREWORD
Aquaculture continues to grow in economic importance. The main reason for this is the quantifiable contribution aquaculture is making in many countries to fill the growing gap between supply and demand for fisheries products. This gap continues to widen because of increasing human populations and the static growth rates of capture fisheries brought about by declines in stocks and the increasing cost of obtaining fish through conventional methods. Although this gap can (and in some cases is already) being met by alternatives, such as inexpensive poultry and white meats, aquaculture particularly provides consumers with a choice of fresh products.
Aquaculture is also evident in earning foreign exchange for many countries through the export of high-value products. It also creates employment, particularly in economically depressed coastal and remote regions, and contributes to the household economy of rural farmers.
This seventh regional survey prepared by the Aquaculture Development and Coordination Programme (ADCP) covers the existing aquaculture sector in countries of the North America region, namely Canada, Greenland and the United States of America. Mexico, although geographically in North America, is not included in the present survey. Mexico is included in the ADCP regional survey of aquaculture in Latin America.
This present survey is not exhaustive. It has been prepared by Craig B. Kensler in a relatively brief desk study. The ADCP apologizes for any omissions and errors which may exist in the survey, and hopes that these can be corrected in an up-dated survey. New information and notification of changes and errors should be indicated to the ADCP in the Fisheries Department, FAO, Rome. The detailed Table of Contents illustrates the range of information which, hopefully, will be assembled in due course for all regions.
The survey is directed toward administrators, executives, and managers who require broad overviews, rather than for scientists and technologists who require detailed information about species and practices. It is the seventh of a series of regional surveys. To this end, the ADCP hopes that the reader will find the information described here useful.

INTRODUCTION
This regional survey of the aquaculture sector in North America is part of the global survey currently being undertaken by the UNDP/FAO Aquaculture Development and Coordination Programme (ADCP). In this survey North America includes Canada, Greenland, and the United States of America (USA). Most information and data for the survey were obtained from the Fisheries Branch Library and the Fishery Statistics Service of FAO in Rome.
The main characteristics of the North American region include high standards of living and high gross national product (GNP) per caput, especially in Canada (US$ 14 100) and the USA (US$ 17 500). All three countries have huge land masses: Greenland is the largest island in the world, Canada is the second largest country, and the USA is the fourth. Each country has extensive coastlines and in Canada and the USA there are many freshwater areas.
Canada is the largest exporter of fish and fishery products in the world. Over 95% of the annual fish catch in Greenland is exported, and the majority of this is shrimp. The USA is traditionally the first or second largest importer (market) in the world for high quality fish and fishery products, especially luxury items such as marine shrimp, shellfish, tuna and salmon.
Production from aquaculture in Canada has been limited, although the country has considerable potential. The aquaculture industry has been developing in all regions of Canada; notably with salmon, rainbow trout and oysters in British Columbia; trout in the Prairie Provinces, Ontario and Quebec; and salmon, trout, mussels and oysters in the Maritime Provinces.
Greenland has no reported aquaculture production at present, or in past years. However, salmon culture in Greenland has been mentioned as a possibility, mainly to supplement natural stocks.
Although fish farming has taken place in the USA for a long time, only in recent years has production increased substantially. The USA is now the fifth leading aquaculture producer in the world. Production is based mainly on channel catfish, American cupped oyster and freshwater crawfish farming in the south and southeast; rainbow trout, pink salmon and Pacific cupped oyster farming in the north and northwest.

1.6 Information for the trade
1.1 Nutritional benefits of fish and shellfish
First and foremost, increasing the per caput consumption of fish and shellfish in any country benefits health. Aquatic animals contain a high level of protein (17-20%), with an amino-acid profile similar Co that of the meat of land animals. The flesh of fish can therefore be readily digested and immediately utilized by the human body. Compared with land animals (with some exceptions, such as shellfish), aquatic animals have a far higher percentage of edible flesh, and there is little wastage. Aquatic animals are a source of minerals, such as calcium, iron, and phosphorus, as well as trace elements and vitamins. Marine species are particularly rich in iodine. The fatty-acid content is high in polyunsaturates, and particularly those which are attributed to reduce blood cholesterol.
1.2 Characteristics of consumption in the region
Canada and the USA have very high standards of living and their inhabitants generally enjoy a high protein diet. The consumption of meat is very much higher than fish in both countries. According to the FAO Food Balance Sheets (see Tables 1 and 2), the 1984-86 average annual combined meat plus fish per caput consumption was:
116 kg/caput in Canada
133 kg/caput in the USA
In Canada present annual per caput consumption of meat, eggs and poultry is: pork 28 kg, beef 40 kg, eggs 12 kg and poultry 24 kg. Per caput consumption of the same commodities in the USA is: pork 29 kg, beef 49 kg, eggs 15 kg and poultry 32 kg. During the period 1960-85, consumption patterns of eggs, meat, fish and poultry products in the USA showed eggs declined by 22%, pork increased slightly less than 3%, beef increased by 16%, fish increased by nearly 20%, and poultry increased over 100%.
These changes reflect the general public's awareness of the health attributes of the various products. In the case of poultry, its ready availability and competitive price were also important factors in its increased consumption. Shifts have also been noted in the demand for various products as Government research institutions in both countries have called for increased consumption of cereals, chicken, fish and fruits, and a relative decrease in amounts of red meat and dairy products with high fat contents. In general, demand for fish and fishery products in Canada and the USA is expected to grow as consumers' disposable income increases and consumers realize the nutritional benefits of seafood.
No data are available for annual meat consumption in Greenland. However, during the winter months smoked mutton is frequently consumed. Consumption of fish and fishery products in Greenland has changed little over the years. Fresh fish is consumed during the main fishing seasons, whereas salted and dried fish make up the bulk of the consumption during the rest of the year.
1.3 Annual comsumptionof fish and shellfish
The 1984-86 average annual consumption of fish and fishery products in the region was: Canada 23.2 kg per caput, Greenland 85.5 kg per caput (1987 figure), and the USA 21.7 kg per caput. The 23.2 kg per caput of fish and shellfish consumed in Canada was made up of 2.8 kg of freshwater fish, 13.5 kg of marine fish (7.0 kg of demersal, 5.5 kg of pelagic and 1.0 kg of other marine fish), 4.3 kg of crustaceans and 2.6 kg of molluscs. The 21.7 kg per caput of fish and shellfish consumed in the USA was composed of 1.1 kg of freshwater fish, 12.2 kg of marine fish (8.6 kg of demersal, 3.5 kg of pelagic and 0.2 kg of other marine fish), 2.7 kg of crustaceans and 5.8 kg of molluscs.
In 1986 only 0.7% of all edible fish and shellfish in Canada came from aquaculture, whereas in the USA the figure was 27% (up from 12% in 1984). Most Canadian farmed rainbow trout, blue mussels and oysters are consumed domestically. Consumption of farmed catfish, trout, salmon and shrimp has increased annually in the USA and the demand remains strong.
1.4 Gross market data
Data from the World Bank Atlas (1988) showed the 1986 GNP in US$ per caput (with % real growth for 1985-86) was Canada, US$ 14 100 (+ 1.8%); Greenland, US$ 8 790 (+ 8.4%); and the USA, US$ 17 500 (+ 1.9%).
The population of Canada increased from 25 379 000 to 25 655 000 between 1985 and 1986, representing a + 1.2% growth rate between 1973-86.
From 1985 to 1986 the population of Greenland remained stable at about 53 000, but showed a + 0.7% growth rate between 1973-86.
The population of the USA increased from 239 283 000 to 241 252 000 between 1985 and 1986, representing a + 1.0% growth rate between 1973-86.
1.5 Specific market data
Canadian fish landings in 1986 totalled 1.53 million metric tonnes (t) , valued at Can.$ 1.35 thousand million. Of the total, 1.40 million t were sold for human consumption. Approximately 19% of the catch was marketed as fresh fish and as frozen products. Included in the landings were about 11 396 t of Canadian farmed production, valued at about Can.$ 32 million (in value 50% trout, 21% oysters, 20% salmon and about 9% blue mussels).
Commercial landings in Greenland in 1986 totalled 100 000 t. The catch was marketed as fish (fresh, chilled or frozen), 19%; fish (dried, salted or smoked), 3%; Crustacea (fresh, chilled or frozen), 62%; fish products and preparations, 0.8%; crustacean products and preparations, 15%; and fish meals, 0.2%. A large part of domestic demand is supplied by part-time and hobby fishermen. Greenland has no reported aquaculture production.
Commercial fish landings (edible) in the USA were 1.5 million t in 1986, a decrease compared with 1985 landings. Approximately 63% of the 1986 catch was marketed as fresh and frozen (39% finfish and 24% shellfish), and 37% was marketed as canned fish products. Included in the edible landings were about 417 084 t of aquaculture production, valued at US$ 520 million (in value 44% catfish, 11% trout, 9% freshwater crawfish, 9% golden shiner and 6% American oyster). Landings of industrial (non-edible) fish were 1.2 million t in 1986.
Canada is a net exporter of fish, shellfish and fishery products. Fish is its second largest food export after grains. In 1986, the volume of Canadian fish and fishery products exports increased by 6% to 590 855 t, representing 73% of total fish production. The value of fish exports increased 30% in 1986 to a total of Can.$ 2.4 thousand million. Canada is the world's leading exporter of fish and fishery products.
The main fishery products exported from Canada continue to be salmon (including 75% of farmed production) and herring products from the Pacific fishery; and cod, flatfish, crab, lobster and scallop products from the Atlantic fishery. The USA continues to be the most important export market for Canadian fish and fishery products, receiving 59% volume of its fish exports in 1986. The European Economic Community (EEC) received 13% of Canadian fish exports, other European countries 6%, Central and South America 6%, and Japan 13%.
The fishing industry plays a central role in Greenland. About a quarter of the actively employed population is within the sector and fish and fish products account for two-thirds of the total value of all exports. Traditionally Greenland is a net exporter of fish and fishery products. Over 97% of the total 1986 fish production, including imports for the year, was exported. Exports of fish and fishery products from Greenland in 1986 totalled 95 800 t, valued at US$ 211 million. The main export for the past few years has been prawns and prawn products and preparations, which accounted for 79% of total fish exports in 1986. Denmark is the major market for Greenland's fish exports; in 1985 it received 99% of the exports.
Total USA exports of edible fishery products of domestic origin in 1986 were a record 334 000 t, valued at a record US$ 1.3 thousand million. The main export was salmon (fresh/frozen and canned). A partial reason for increased USA exports of fishery products was the decline in the value of the US dollar relative to most other currencies. For example, the value of the US dollar dropped 30% against the Japanese yen between 1985 and 1986, increasing the competitiveness of US fishery products in the Japanese market.
Canada's fish imports in 1986 increased to 152 371 t, valued at Can.$ 616 million. Increases occurred primarily in fresh and frozen fish, canned tuna and fresh or frozen shrimp or prawns. The largest supplier of fish product imports to Canada in 1986 was the USA (60% of volume and 51% of value), followed by the EEC (33% volume), Japan, Central and South America, and other European countries.
Fish imports to Greenland are minor and in 1986 totalled only 426 t, valued at US$ 1.1 million. Overall, imports represented less than 1% of total domestic fish landings in Greenland.
The USA is a net importer of fish and fishery products. Imports of edible fishery products in 1986 totalled 1.4 million t, valued at a record US$ 4.8 thousand million. The US is the second largest market in the world for fish and fishery products. Shrimp and tuna were the major species imported. The quantity of shrimp imported in 1986 established a record with 182 000 t, which included farmed shrimp from Latin America and S.E. Asia. Valued at US$ 1.4 thousand million, shrimp imports accounted for 30% of the value of total US edible imports.
1.6 Information for the trade
Information for the commercial aquaculture fish trade is available for Canada, Greenland and the USA in the form of various monthly and quarterly magazines and news-sheets, such as: Seafood Business, Seafood Leader, FAO GLOBEFISH Highlights, Greensheets (NMFS), and the Seafood International Directory 1988 (see Bibliography of Resource Materials).
Also, two annual directories - Canadian Aquaculture Magazine 1988 Buyer's Guide, and Aquaculture Magazine Buyer's Guide for 1988 - (see Bibliography) provide a range of information and addresses dealing with (a) consumer and market publications, (b) fish processors, brokers and buyers, (c) exporters and importers, and (d) wholesalers of seafood and fish products. Market information and contact addresses for aquaculture products in Canada and the USA are also available from the North American Directory of Aquaculture 1988/89 (published by Kevgor Aquasystems, Vancouver, Canada).
Detailed trade information for fish and fish products in Greenland is limited. A list of 18 fish processors and exporters in Greenland is given in The Danish Fisheries (1980), along with a brief description of the fishing industry in Greenland.

2. PRODUCTION OF FISH AND SHELLFISH IN REGION
2.1 Characteristics of production in the region
2.2 Regional production data
2.3 Production systems and practices in the region
2.4 Producers in the region
2.5 Organizations of producers
2.6 Financial investment by public and private enterprises
2.1 Characteristics of production in the region
Production from aquaculture in Canada has been limited, although the country has considerable potential. The aquaculture industry has been developing in all regions of Canada; notably with salmon, rainbow trout and oysters in British Columbia (B.C.); trout in the Prairie Provinces, Ontario and Quebec; and salmon, trout, mussels and oysters in the Maritime Provinces. Regional differences in climate and in freshwater and marine environments have created significant variations in the type and scope of aquacultural production across Canada. However, one element is common in all regions: aquaculture is a high-growth industry.
Greenland has no reported aquaculture production at present, or in past years (pers.comm., FAO Fishery Statistics Unit, Rome). However, salmon aquaculture in Greenland has been mentioned as a possibility, mainly to supplement natural stocks (which are subject to heavy international exploitation). An alternative suggestion has focused on sea-ranching of salmon using existing streams. Through stream enhancement and smolt-release programmes, leading to sea-ranching, an interest could develop in the salmon as a resource to be managed, not only harvested. A similar aquaculture effort with Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus) might likewise yield benefits.
In the USA, aquaculture production has increased greatly in the past few years. In 1984, about 12% of all edible fish and shellfish in the USA came from aquaculture, whereas by 1986 the percentage had increased to about 27% (meat weights only calculated for oysters and clams). Salmon production has grown steadily in importance since the early eighties. Freshwater crawfish (Procambarus spp.) production increased 39% between 1984 and 1986. However, the most exciting aquaculture growth has been with the freshwater channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus), which increased about 27% in volume between 1984 and 1986. Catfish farming since 1984 has annually represented about 35% of the total volume of production from aquaculture in the USA.
2.2 Regional production data
Total aquaculture production for the region (Canada, Greenland and the USA) in 1986 was 428 480 C (FAO, 1989). Canada's production was 11 396 t, or about 2.7% of the regional total. Greenland had no reported aquaculture production. The USA aquaculture harvest in 1986 was 417 084 t, or 97.3% of the regional production. Overall, the freshwater environment accounted for 56.4%, and the marine environment for 43.6%, of the total aquaculture production of the region. No production was reported from the brackishwater environment (FAO, 1988a). The common and scientific names of species/groups cultured commercially in North America are given in Table 3 (as used by FAO).
Canadian aquaculture production data for the years 1984, 1985 and 1986 are summarized in Table 4 (FAO, 1989), by species or group. Production increased about 10% (878 t) from 1984 to 1985, and about 24% (2 798 t) from 1985 to 1986. Fish represented about 30% (3 439 t) of the 1986 harvest, and molluscs about 70% (7 957 t). Production in 1984 and 1985 was similar with fish representing about 20-23% of total volume. During 1984-86 the freshwater environment produced an average of about 20% and the marine environment about 80% of annual production. No production was reported from the brackishwater environment.
Over 90% of the total volume of the 1986 harvest was from four species: Pacific cupped oyster = 3 700 t (32.4% of 1986 production); American cupped oyster = 2 400 t (21.0%); rainbow trout = 2 384 t (20.9%); and blue mussel = 1 845 t (16.1%). Few data are available from FAO for total value of Canadian production by group or species during 1984-86. However, information from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), (1988a) is available and shows that the total value of 1986 aquaculture production was Can.$ 32.2 million; the main groups being as follows:
Rainbow trout
Can.$ 16 193 000
Atlantic salmon
American cupped oyster
Pacific cupped oyster
Blue mussel
Pacific salmon
Provisional figures for 1987 indicate that Canada's aquaculture production was approximately Can.$ 50 million, a considerable increase from the Can.$ 32 million recorded in 1986. Salmon constituted about one-half of the total Canadian aquaculture production value in 1987.
By 1989 the Canadian Federal Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) may be well on its way to a national, computerized system for aquaculture statistics. The planned system would record cultured production figures, sales and prices, species, culture methods and operations, and employment numbers from all ten provinces.
USA aquaculture production data for the years 1984, 1985 and 1986 are summarized in Table 5 (FAO, 1989), by species or group. Production increased about 5.6% (20 459 t) from 1984 to 1985, and about 12.3% (51 654 t) from 1985 to 1986. Production in 1986 was 417 084 t; fish represented about 56% (234 033 t) of the total harvest, crustacea about 11% (45 014 t) and molluscs about 33% (138 037 t). The trend in production in 1984 and 1985 was similar with fish representing over 50% of total volume, followed by molluscs and then crustacea.
During 1986 the freshwater environment produced about 57% and the marine environment about 43% of the USA aquaculture harvest. No production was reported from the brackishwater environment. Over 87% of the total volume of the 1986 harvest was from six species, which are listed below along with production figures and percentage of the total harvest.

Whiteleg shrimp
The total value of the 1986 aquaculture harvest in the USA was about US$ 519 489 630 (FAO, 1988a). Five major species accounted for 79% of the value. They are listed below, along with their commercial value and percentage of the total 1986 harvest.

Not normally included in the aquaculture statistics for the USA is the production of hundreds of millions of juvenile fish per year to support the nation's valuable recreational fishing industry. The fish are produced in 75 facilities of the US Fish and Wildlife Service's National Fish Hatchery System, by more than 1 000 private hatcheries across the US, and by the hundreds of state hatcheries that produce game fish for stocking primarily in public waters. Without fish culture, a number of these fisheries would collapse. The main fish stocked by federal, state and private hatcheries in 1980 to support US sport fisheries (primarily recreational) are given below by species and by numbers.

2.3 Production systems and practices in the region
Details on the culture systems used to produce the bulk of Canada's aquaculture production can be summarized as follows:
Spat (seed) of the Pacific cupped oyster is either collected from the wild in British Columbia waters or obtained from local hatcheries. Some seed is imported from Japan and the USA. The main on-growing method is extensive bottom culture (1 741 ha under lease in B.C. in 1987), although there is some production from suspended culture. Approximately 75% of production is from the Gulf of Georgia, in southern B.C. American cupped oysters are cultivated in all three Maritime Provinces, mainly by extensive bottom culture. In Prince Edward Island (PEI) most oyster production is from harvesting from public beds and on-growing on privately leased beds, whilst in New Brunswick 75% of oyster production in 1987 was from public beds. Most oyster spat is collected from the wild, although locally produced hatchery spat is available.
The European flat oyster is cultured on trays, in lantern nets and by extensive bottom fanning. Most of the seed used is hatchery produced; there is limited wild seed collection. Seed of the blue mussel is collected from the wild on the Atlantic coast and is cultured on long lines. There is only experimental culture of the blue mussel on the Pacific coast of Canada. Clams are grown by bottom culture (extensive), using seed collected from the wild.
Atlantic salmon are intensively cultured in sea cages, using smolts produced in local private hatcheries. Pacific salmon are grown mainly in net pens in sheltered marine bays or inlets (178 operating farms totalling 940 ha in 1988) using intensive culture practices. The smolts are all hatchery produced. Rainbow trout production varies with the region of Canada although all fry are hatchery produced. On the Pacific coast trout are grown in freshwater ponds and raceways, using intensive methods. There is some experimental sea cage culture. In central Canada the main method is intensive freshwater pond culture, with some production coming from semi-intensive pothole culture in Manitoba. Most of the production in Quebec comes from freshwater ponds, although some raceways are also used. On the Atlantic coast rainbow trout are intensively cultured in raceways, ponds and in sea cages. The 50 t of northern bluefin tuna cultured in Atlantic Canada in 1984 came from tuna that had been
wild caught and then semi-intensively on-grown for four months in large impoundment nets anchored to the sea floor, before being harvested.
Since 79% of the value of USA production in 1986 was accounted for by only five species, their production systems are now briefly described.
The bulk of channel catfish production is semi-intensive and intensive pond culture in the Lower Mississippi Valley. Small amounts in 1986 came from intensive raceway culture (1 100 t) and from intensive cage culture (527 t). Mississippi catfish farmers, who produce about 80% of the US catfish, had 29 800 ha in commercial production in 1985. By the end of 1986 the amount of total area had increased by 10%, to 32 800 ha, and was expected to reach about 36 400 ha by the end of 1987.
Most rainbow trout farming takes place in freshwater raceway systems, although 10% of the 1985 harvest was produced in sea cages. Trout culture in the USA is usually intensive. The state of Idaho is the leading producer.
In 1986 red swamp crawfish were cultured for food on about 52 600 ha in Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi and South Carolina. Crawfish are cultured in several types of ponds. Wooded ponds may produce 225-338 kg/ha under extensive practices. Ponds constructed solely for crawfish culture, and rice fields used in rice/crawfish double-cropping, usually average about 900 kg/ha. Intensively cultured ponds can produce 2 800-3 360 kg/ha if managed well. A major trend in crawfish culture involves double-cropping of rice and crawfish. The USA grows rice on 1.01-1.13 million ha of farms that possess the major ingredients for growing crawfish, i.e. water, levees, and a source of food (decaying rice stubble).
Golden shiner is a freshwater species produced solely as baitfish for the sport and commercial fishery industry. Most golden shiners are cultured in enclosed ponds supplied with water from underground sources. Yields as high as 1 570 kg/ha have been achieved in well managed ponds, under semi-intensive conditions. Arkansas is the main producer of golden shiner (and other baitfish) and in 1982 had 22 800 ha devoted to baitfish production; Minnesota reported 731 baitfish ponds totalling about 6 500 ha. The states of Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Missouri each had a minimum of 400 ha of ponds devoted to baitfish culture.
The majority of American cupped oyster seed (spat) is collected from the wild and on-grown extensively in suitable inshore areas. Commercial oyster hatcheries provide seed mainly in the Pacific area of the USA. With very well managed bottom culture (such as in Long Island Sound, New York) it is possible Co produce 5 000 kg/ha (of meat) per year. Public grounds, with little or no management, produce only 10-100 kg/ha (of meat) per year. Studies of off-bottom culture have indicated that 0.1 ha covered by rack culture could yield 2.6 t of meat per year. The size of an oyster culture operation varies from 1-1.2 ha in Maryland, to 4-6 ha in Virginia, to 80 940 ha in Long Island Sound. In the Gulf Coast area, over 93 000 ha of leased tracts were in production in the early eighties. No data are available for total area under oyster production in the USA.
2.4 Producers in the region
In 1986 there was a total of approximately 3 101 licensed aquaculture establishments in Canada. Of these licensed establishments, 2% were for the purpose of culturing Atlantic salmon, 3% for Pacific salmon, 29% for trout, 55% for oysters and 11% for blue mussels.
As many as 7 000 people were involved in aquaculture production in Canada in 1987, but many were 'seasonal', part-time workers or private fish farmers licensed to rear trout for their own use (mainly in Central Canada). Some general figures are available and are summarized as follows:
Maritime Provinces:
1 000 seasonal jobs in oyster farming, 500 people in blue mussel culture and 220 people in the salmon farming industry in 1987.
Quebec:
about 500 people directly involved with trout culture.
British Columbia:
1 400 people directly employed in aquaculture in 1987 (118 salmon farming sites, 154 trout farming operations, and 249 oyster growers operating 385 leased sites).
Ontario:
500 jobs directly associated with trout farming.
Central Canada:
about 100-150 commercial fish farm operators and about 1 000 private fish farmers licensed to rear trout for their own use.
Saskatchewan:
120 commercial fish farmers (trout) in 1987 and about 2 300 private licensed fish farmers.
The private aquaculture industry in the USA employs tens of thousands of people, some as full-time producers and many as part-time or 'seasonal' workers. Estimates of numbers of producers are available for only a few of the main groups/species being commercially cultured.
Channel catfish:
In 1980, over 3 800 operators were reported involved in catfish farming. Not known how many employed on average farm. Since then production has expanded over 400%.
Rainbow trout:
653 growers of all types (egg producers, fingerling producers, market fish producers and grow-out producers); 1 086 operators of trout for fish-out ponds.
Freshwater crawfish:
40 processing plants operating in south Louisiana in 1982 and 100 'soft-shell' producers in 1988.
Golden shiner:
1 544 baitfish farms in 1978. Not known how many employed on average per farm.
American cupped oyster:
1 424 individual (private) lease tracts in Louisiana; 247 oyster businesses were identified from Maine to Virginia.
The private sector involvement in USA aquaculture in 1980 was summarized as follows: the US aquaculture industry is represented by 1 100 catfish farms; 250 trout farms; 400 crawfish farms; 25 commercial salmon farms; over 500 oyster culture firms; 30 firms culturing clams, mussels and abalone; 15 US-owned shrimp farming firms operating in Latin America and the USA; 20 freshwater prawn firms concentrated in Hawaii; and a number of individuals and firms who are culturing other species.
Between 1980-86, USA aquaculture production increased about 445%; therefore the total number of producers and people working in production would have expanded greatly as well.
2.5 Organizations of producers
At least 31 associations are active in promoting commercial fish and shellfish farming development in Canada.
