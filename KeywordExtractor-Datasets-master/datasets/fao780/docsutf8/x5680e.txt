Executive summary
The project needs to finalise the social component and the extension programme. It should be done considering the limited time still left. Nevertheless, pilot extension communication activities can be implemented and monitored to raise awareness among different stakeholders and to prepare the ground for future activities.
A communication strategy and workplan have been formulated within the framework of the overall extension programme. Communication and extension activities, have been formulated in order to support the introduction of a collaborative management approach and to involve all stakeholders. Within this framework, three main issues have been identified as fundamental for the extension communication strategy: information and education for rangeland and wildlife management; extension and community based learning (training); communication activities for collaborative management. Specific objectives and activities have been defined according to target groups prioritised by the project, such as:
- production of a pilot radio programme to be broadcast once a week;
- preparation of sets of appropriate visual aids to support education and training (especially flipcharts on cloth);
- production of a video documentary to raise awareness about project activities and results;
- implementation of communication activities to support the establishment of grazing committees and the identification of collaborative activities.
Special attention has been given to horizontal information sharing especially among women groups. The identification and training of community facilitators, as well as the establishment of programme to support women learning process about environmental degradation, animal care and solutions to their problems is strongly recommended.
Several recommendations were defined in order to improve the activities and results of the extension unit, such as:
- an improvement of the process for data collection related to the need to elaborate extension messages and communication material through a participatory message design process;
- to organise photo and video archives and to implement activities to document project activities on a regular basis, identifying since the beginning of the project the final products required (e.g. documentary, publications);
- a better definition of the tasks assigned to the staff of the extension unit;
- training of the staff especially in: communication planning; participatory message design; radio, video and low cost material production;
- inclusion in the extension staff of a local artist in order to be able to quickly prepare visual aids with Bedouins;
- specifications for the purchase of new equipment.
Furthermore, additional research on Bedouins informal communication flow and decision making process is recommended in order to enable the definition of a wider extension/communication strategy, which should be one of the most important components in case a second phase is approved.
During the mission opportunities for collaboration were discussed with the Extension Directorate in order to strengthen project capacity to implement the extension/communication strategy and to ensure adequate follow up. A workshop has been scheduled for the month of March in order to allow to set up a final agreement and to identify responsibilities for the implementation of a joint strategy.

I. Background
1.1. Project background and present situation
1.2. Activities carried out
Bedouins are proud of grazing life and settlement never attracted them as long as their herds were fed and happy......
The tribes are the nations and the rangelands are the states.
(A. Masri 1991)
1.1. Project background and present situation
- General overview
Project GCP/SYR/003/ITA is a rangeland and wildlife management project for the rehabilitation of marginal lands and the establishment and conservation of wildlife in the Syrian Steppe, which started in February 1996 with an overall duration of three years. The project is financed by the Government of Italy and is being executed by FAO and the Directorate of Al-Badia of the Ministry of Agriculture and Agrarian Reform (MAAR). The project area covers some 130,000 ha in one of the driest parts of Syria, with a mean annual rainfall of less than 200mm. It is divided into four sub-areas: Talila Wildlife Reserve, Arak, Mumbateh and Abassiya. This is part of a vast arid ecosystem named Al-Badia which covers approximately 55% of the Syrian territory. The project is located in the city of Palmyra within the building of the Directorate of Al-Badia. The international staff includes a CTA, a rangeland specialist, and a wildlife expert, while the national personnel is formed by a National
project director, wildlife specialist, a rangeland counterpart and a technician, 4 extensionists (2 men and 2 women) and a national extension consultant.
The immediate objectives presented in the project document are: "to help national institutions to develop appropriate techniques for a sustainable use of the grazing land" and "to establish an integrated model for the use and maintenance of an area grazed by wild and domestic animals". The long term objectives of the project also foresee " to enhance human resources and communication abilities, data analysis and planning capacities of national officers for the development of improved techniques and new national regulation for the use of communal grazing lands".
The ultimate beneficiaries of the project are the livestock operators of the area, namely Bedouins households and tribes organised by the Peasant Union, a syndicate supported by the Government, in three local cooperatives for sheep raising: Arak, Mumbateh and Abassiya (see map 2). Another group of beneficiaries are the camel herders also organised under a cooperative. The cooperatives are in charge of range and sheep improvement but at the moment they mainly dedicate to provide supplementary feeding for sheep to their members. At the moment over three thousand members are inscribed in local cooperatives but the number of rangeland users is much higher than the people officially inscribed.
The grazing period varies according to the rainfall regime but in general it occurs during February - May. Nevertheless, animals are in Al-Badia also in the period included from November to January but they depend on supplementary feed (introduced for the first time during the drought of 1958-59), and normally provided by the Cooperatives to their members.
Since early 70s the Government issued law and acts to protect rangeland natural resources, especially by prohibiting cultivation in Al-Badia. Furthermore in 1991 Al-Talila Wildlife reserve was established to rehabilitate habitats, protect wild animals and to generate income to local communities through eco-tourism since the Palmyra area already attracts tourists with its historical and archaeological features.
Al-Badia Rangeland Sheep Directorate, the national counterpart agency, is implementing Government policy by:
- establishing 82 lamb fattening cooperatives;
- reducing pressure on range;
- establishing 28 range and sheep improvement centres covering about 75,000 ha which are used for: seed collection; grazing by government sheep flocks; grazing by neighbours communities flocks; improvement of milk, meat and wool production; distribution of improved rams; establishing nurseries for the production of shrub seedlings; maintaining 170 wells.
- Activities and challenges: seeking the social sustainability of the project.
As mentioned earlier the project focuses on two major objectives: the improvement of range management and the establishment of a wildlife reserve. The main problem the project has to face is the deterioration of Al-Badia rangelands due to:
- destruction of vegetation cover by ploughing the land;
- early and overgrazing by an increasing sheep population;
- fuel collection through cutting and uprooting of fodder shrubs as source of firewood;
- off-road driving of vehicles that has destructive effect on vegetation and soils;
- increased stocking around boreholes and other sources of water.
The main activities being carried out to accomplish project objectives are:
- Range rehabilitation and management: improvement of range sites; planting shrubs; range reseeding; seed planting; data collection and monitoring of reseeding techniques and resided areas; surveys of soils, topography and vegetation; preparation of a range management plan; promotion of the use of alternative energy sources such as solar energy and solar stoves.
- Wildlife reserve: reserve management plan; reintroduction of wild animals (gazelles and oryx); improvement offences; controlled grazing by camels in the reserve; feasibility studies on eco-tourism activities to be initiated; wildlife management through: monitoring of the animals; provision of water and supplementary feed; control of the fencing.
According to the tripartite review mission undertaken in October 1997 the project has already achieved successful results from the technical point of view. This is also due to the fact that the project has carefully considered socio-economic aspects (several studies have been carried out), promoting culturally appropriate technologies, and fostering the active participation of range resources users in several occasions.
Nevertheless, as underlined by the report of the tripartite review, in the project document the design of the social component was extremely weak if compered with the impact that rehabilitation measures will have on traditional grazing habits and to the need for collaborative management mechanisms involving all stakeholders for implementing sustainable management plans. Several range management specialists and ecologists indicate that the main social factors affecting the rangeland stability have been: inappropriate agricultural practices, the introduction of gasoline engines (water trucks, pick-up trucks, pumps and plough tractors) as well as the lack of consideration for the traditional tribal based rangeland management model, the so called Hema system. The latter is a delicate issue which will became evident once the range rehabilitation process supported by the project is completed, and the range management scheme implemented. This will also involve a clear definition of
the land tenure system and the establishment of consultative decision making procedures, enabling the social sustainability of technical measures by involving and benefiting local people.
To take care of different social aspects the project is dealing with, since 1996 an extension unit was created and a strong Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) component is being implemented. Two PRA workshops were held (March and September 1997) to develop skills in PRA for applied field and extension work. Furthermore, a national consultancy was undertaken to identify the extension needs of Bedouin women. The PRA work contributed to:
- define a methodological framework to interact with the ultimate beneficiaries
- specifying main target groups of the project
- identify preliminary activities to be carried out
- identify extension needs both of men and women
- initiate community awareness
- identify activities addressed to women
- agree upon collaborative activities
- improve the ability of the extension staff to communicate with the target groups
Nevertheless PRA is a process, it is not an just an extractive means of gathering information. It is developed according to project needs to improve participation and to reach strategic agreements with the target groups. Presently, relevant socio-economic data as well as extension needs assessment of target population is being complemented and systematised. It will provide valuable elements to orient the overall strategy of the project as well as for further specifying extension and communication activities according to Bedouin needs. It also offers legitimacy for the project to claim for alternative rangeland management measures and presents to decision makers, cooperatives and households a possibility to establish a collaborative framework and procedures for participatory planning. Presently, the project is involved in the challenging task of establishing grazing committees to enhance participation and undertake collaborative activities. Furthermore, another important
activity the project is initiating is the establishment of an extension programme for women.
The tripartite review recommended to strengthen the social component and the extension activities by formulating a communication strategy and workplan for the project in order to ensure that the intended beneficiaries "feel that they are stakeholders". This recommendation has been the starting point for the present mission.
1.2. Activities carried out
- Mission framework and results
The mission was undertaken to build up a communication strategy within the context of the overall extension component and workplan actually being formulated to support project objectives and activities. To such extent, accurate analysis of the PRA assessment of stakeholders and project extension needs, as well as concrete opportunities and constraints to develop and implement the communication component have been carried out. The result has been the design of extension and communication activities, to reach awareness about project objectives and activities both at community, local, and national level, to support information, education and training processes and to enhance people's participation. Nevertheless, the consultant feels that further activities should be undertaken to validate mission outcomes at community level, to collect complementary data (especially regarding information flow among herders, presence of traditional opinion leaders, the use of mass media and the
visual perception especially of women) and to carry out specific training on communication planning and participatory message design for the extension staff. Furthermore special attention should be also given to train the extension staff in low-cost media, radio and video production methodologies.
- Methodology and activities implemented
The terms of reference of the mission included the following tasks:
- assessment of main communication needs of the different target audiences of the project;
- preparation of a communication strategy up to the end of the project;
- identification of the most appropriate type of visual aids for modules aimed at Bedouin women;
- recommending simple techniques for producing educational materials;
- identification of production facilities in Syria;
- recommending guidelines for video series;
(Detailed Terms of Reference are presented in annex 1)
Due to the enormous amount of data already available within the project and the time constraints, the consultant concentrated on in-project assessment and planning activities such as:
- Intensive work with the CTA, the staff of the extension unit and the national extension consultant:
presentations of communication for development concepts and methodology and of the assessment and planning activities for the extension/communication component (see document in annex 4);
- PRA data analysis;
- Thematic brainstorming sessions;
- Questionnaire to assess staff tasks, skills and expectations (see annex 5).
- Field meeting with Camel herders for the establishment of a grazing committee;
- Interview of technical staff and local people;
- Interviews with the director of the Directorate of Extension, Ministry of Agriculture and Agrarian Reform and the Executive Producer to identify an institutional framework for collaboration and production facilities.
Finally, an early draft of mission recommendations was prepared, discussed and agreed upon with the project CTA before leaving Palmyra.

2.1. Project target groups
- General features.
Project activities involve a variety of target groups. The most important are the ultimate beneficiaries, the livestock operators which are divided according to their movements for grazing the herds into three groups: settled, semi-settled and nomads. In general terms the nomadic groups (sheep and camel herders) maintain a presence in the area which varies from 6 to 8 months according to the seasonal rainfall and availability of pasture. Bedouins communities and household are mainly devoted to sheep and camel breeding. Typical households include not only a nuclear family but extended families totalling 8-12 persons per household. Both the camel herders as well the sheep herders consider themselves as members of natural groups, the tribes. Each tribe is divided into sub-groups related to some influential person, the muhtar.
According to the PRA outcomes (Chatty 1997:2) members of the cooperatives are divided into two groups: livestock herders, generally living in tents, and sheep owners and merchants, generally living in cement houses in the villages (these can also have mobile tent household as well). Furthermore, in the cooperatives areas there are many Bedouins who are not cooperative members but spend part of the year in the area. They are also being considered by the project as target group.
According to the surveys carried out by the project, the literacy rate in the area is very low: among the settled households 85 % of men and 96 % of women are illiterate while among nomads more than 95% of men and close to 100 % of women are illiterate. At the same time the presence of mass media in the area is quite impressive. Data collected by the project show that 36 % of camel herders households have television while 42 % have radio. These equipment are normally powered by diesel generators. According to the information collected by the extension unit Bedouins' interest is mainly related to films about life in the steppe, and to weather forecast and news programme. An increased interest for soap opera has also been noticed. Bedouins have access to two other official and external sources of information: the veterinarian services and cooperatives. The cooperatives provide information mainly related to fodder delivery and similar topics, while the information delivered by
the veterinarians is related to emergencies and normally based on scientific terminology. There is a great demand among Bedouins for veterinarian assistance and training.
In the project area the following schools are available:
- Arak: primary school
- Mumbateh: primary school
In Palmyra there are several schools at different levels: primary, intermediary and secondary. A small clinic is available in Arak while another one is in Palmyra. There is telephone service in Mumbateh, Arak and Palmyra.
In Syria there is no extension service attending Bedouins needs. This is due to the operational philosophy of the Syrian Extension Systems, formally based on a methodology of training and visits, and working mainly in the agricultural sector. This is also due to the difficulty to set up appropriate servicing for Bedouins because of their frequent movements covering large distances. Another constraint for traditional extension activities is the lack of "messages and packages" due to total absence of fundamental and adaptive research, while Bedouins traditional knowledge on rangeland and animal breeding is very broad.
In Bedouin society important decisions are mainly taken at household level. Decisions like when to move to another area apparently involve only individual households, but sometime interest groups carry out specific activities, such as the construction of dicks for water. Regularities have been noticed in the seasonal movements of the households but no standardised pattern according to tribes or households has been identified until now. Therefore it is difficult to target and monitor training activities to be carried out by the extension staff on a regular basis.
Special consideration is given by the project to Bedouin women. Recent studies show that at least 78% of women take active part in sheep rearing. Women have a very substantial work load during the lambing and milking season, when they are the primary work force for milking and hand feeding the family flock. Women and girls are also responsible for firewood and water fetching. Milk processing is also considered as women work. Women's workload is very heavy, indeed heavier than man's, at most time of the year. Furthermore, as indicated by the literacy rate, women have limited access to education. According to these features the project decided to consider women as priority target.
- Target groups prioritised by the project
Project activities are related to a wide range of measures for sustainable rangeland and wildlife management which imply the involvement of several stakeholders. Therefore, an increased awareness about problems and solutions the project is dealing with is also required. As underlined by the tripartite review, in order to ensure sustainability and equity for rangeland measures especially, once rangeland is rehabilitated, attention should be given to the land tenure problem. It will imply the involvement of national institutions and policy makers.
According to PRA results, an important aspect to be considered is the existence of different interest groups. For example, villagers and sheep merchants' are very much against having any more land "lost" to reseeding, while Bedouin herders are very much in favour of this in order to improve the range. One of the most challenging tasks of the project, while creating awareness regarding environmental problems, is to reach consensus on the conservation measures among the different target groups and to ensure a positive "climate" for enabling a policy regarding the use of the range and the land tenure. Appropriate communication activities have to be undertaken to prepare the ground for this kind of social interaction which will facilitate improved rangeland and wildlife sustainable management. To ensure effectiveness of activities being implemented by the extension unit, according to the immediate objectives of the project at the present, but also considering further development
of rangeland initiatives, the project prioritised target groups according to the following list:
Ranking of target groups prioritised by the project:
1. nomadic sheep herders
2. camel herders
3. semi-settled sheep herders
4. Local institutions/policy makers
5. Schools
6. General public
As mentioned, earlier women are always considered as a priority target whatever social group they are involved, facilitating their active participation in any extension work being implemented. Another important activity is to enhance local participation by establishing collaborative agreements with target groups for implementing rangeland activities. This is the case of camel herders, which have been allowed to graze in the reserve. Furthermore, six collaborative actions have been prioritised and immediate follow-up has been given (marking out corridors in the reserve areas, provide access to water sources coming out from the reserve etc.). These are the basis for establishing a solid rangeland and wildlife management collaborative process.
2.2. The extension component of the project at the present
- Extension activities carried out
Until now the work developed by the extension unit has been mainly devoted to carrying out activities related to the overall social component, namely research and participatory assessment and planning of project activities. Another important task has been to inform Bedouin households about project objectives and activities through direct contacts (meetings, PRA exercises, field activities etc.). Within the extension team there is enough commitment and willingness to work at field level as well to reach concrete results, but the lack of extension messages and communication materials to work with, as well as the expectations for the results of the PRA process in order to finalise the overall strategy and the extension programme, have limited the possibilities for undertaking extension activities on a regular basis. The project is now validating technical recommendation to be delivered to the Bedouins according to preliminary extension needs identified. At the moment it is
difficult for the project to act as an integrated rural development project. In fact, due to its short duration, it might lead to dispersion of the project's resources and generate expectations without being able to satisfy them. In a second phase, the project could eventually consider the possibility to act as a facilitating agency, by co-ordinating interventions of other institutions according to identified needs. It is therefore recommended that the project concentrates on sustainable wildlife and range management topics generating technical information relevant to Bedouin needs. This technical information should be processed by the extension unit according to communication methodology, and diffused by using appropriate extension activities and communication tools.
The extension staff has very limited knowledge of communication for development methods and techniques. An intense training in participatory message design and production of low cost communication materials is required (see also Recommendation for strategy implementation). Nevertheless, the national extension consultant is an experienced specialist who can take care of implementing and supervising intensive training and communication material production (not radio), once the final version of the extension/communication plan will be approved.
Furthermore the national extension consultant prepared guidelines based on PRA tools and techniques which have been incorporated in the daily work of the extension unit (T. Razouk PRA In Extension. A Special Methodology Design for the Bedouins of the Syrian Steppe).
- Communication materials developed
At the moment the project is still concentrating in raising awareness of all stakeholders on the need for the establishing a rangeland and wildlife scheme. Messages have been delivered until now through direct contacts and meetings. At the same time several attempts to produce communication materials have been undertaken such as:
- Posters
Until now the extension unit has concentrated on the production of visual aids, especially posters. At the moment a set of 13 posters has been produced in draft form. Two of them have been field tested with Bedouins. This activity has to be considered as parallel to the regular activity of the extension unit because the posters have been prepared under the supervision of the national extension consultant, by the students of the Agricultural Extension course at the University of Aleppo as practice for their degree. The messages to be addressed were already available in the project. The general objective was to raise Bedouins awareness on sustainable rangeland and wildlife management also showing problems with cultivation. It was supposed to use the posters by placing them in critical locations such as the headquarters of the Co-operatives, water points, cheese processing facilities and on Bedouins cars. All posters included drawings and generally they would show two
different aspects of the same message: the negative aspect and the positive. Only two posters out of 13 were tested by the extension staff at field level. The criteria considered were: age, sex, level of education; understanding of the general message; time taken to read the message; comments on how to improve the presentation. The main topics and messages presented by the posters are:
1. Sustainable use of rangeland:
- advantages of preserving plots from grazing
- consequences of degradation caused by cultivation
- problems for intensive animal production
- problems caused by agriculture to the grazing environment
- problems caused by uprooting and overgrazing shrubs
- lack of grass for sheep
2. Environmental care:
- degradation and pollution problems
- animals disappearing due to hunting
3. Animal care:
- need for animal health control (by veterinarians)
The draft posters have been carefully analysed by the consultant and the national extension specialist. It was agreed that, in many cases they represent the view of an urban person trying to make appealing to Bedouins a message already defined in another environment. The style of the drawings is similar to comics or caricatures and does not have references with the reality of Al-Badia. The entire process of preparing the message in an external environment and by literate people to convince Bedouins, even if it is inspired by the good intention of providing the project with supporting materials, is a wrong way of addressing the problems and presenting possible solutions. This process should be undertaken jointly with final users who have to be involved in message design and material development to ensure that the material will present a message related to their reality, culturally appropriate, and responding to local graphic and visual codes. It is therefore recommended
the preparation of posters to be done at project level, by involving a talented local artist who can join extension unit activities, such as PRA exercise and meetings with local people, in order to quickly sketch problems and people's views, visualise ideas, and prepare draft materials to be field tested by the extension unit.
- Video and play scripts
Several video scripts and shootings have been prepared by the national extension consultant, and in particular:
1. Talila.
A full script in Arabic for the production of a documentary about project activities has been prepared. About 80 % of the video footage is already available in VHS format but there are still some difficulties in finding editing facilities. The preparation of the video is an urgent task to support project presentations for Bedouins and general public.
2. Seed Production Techniques.
This video programme is aimed at informing technicians about different seed production techniques. At the moment 70 % of video shots is available. Some important footage of seed collection is missing but it could be substitute with photographs.
Furthermore a scenario for a play called "Saleh" was prepared to reach awareness about environmental degradation. It is intended to have this play video recorded in order to present it through television broadcasting and video playback.
(Please note guidelines for production of both video programme are presented in annexes 7 and 8 of the present report.)
- Leaflet
A three pages leaflet with photographs was produced and distributed to present the project.
- Documentary activities
The activities of the project are normally documented through photographs and video recording. Until now an enormous quantity of slides and photos have been collected regarding technical topics. Several video shots have been filmed for further editing. At the moment nobody of the extension staff has received training in video production.
- Displays
The extension unit has prepared visual displays of project activities (photographs on board) and placed them in the corridors of Al Badia Directorate. This is a good communication tool for the rest of the personnel to learn about project activities. Displays can also been
