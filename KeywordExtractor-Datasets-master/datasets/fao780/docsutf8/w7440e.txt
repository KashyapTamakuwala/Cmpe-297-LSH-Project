FOREWORD
Throughout history, policy, including agricultural policy of interest here, has been influenced by a society's values relating to concepts and perceptions of agriculture, nature, equity, and the associated beliefs about the rights or wrongs of the situation. The way in which "values and beliefs" influence the political debate and its outcome becomes possibly more apparent when societies with different histories and cultures, and therefore differing values and beliefs, are brought together for instance on the occasion of discussions aimed at the grouping of countries into regional blocs for economic or political reasons. Beyond the well documented economic and strategic interests of the potential partners, such divergences often underlie the varied country positions taken during the negotiations of the terms of the regional grouping, and unrecognized or unacknowledged differences in values and beliefs can lead to additional complexities in reaching an agreement and later
implementing it. This has been the case for instance in western Europe as the original six countries negotiated the Treaty of Rome to form the then EEC, and in each successive round of accessions (or refusals) since. It was true as first the Canada-US free trade agreement was negotiated and later when NAFTA added Mexico. And it will be true as NAFTA expands throughout the Americas and as APEC becomes a reality.
To assess the importance of values and beliefs in the formulation and implementation of policy, notably policy related to agriculture, FAO decided to take a closer look at how that process unfolds, with a view to making the policy negotiating process - international in this case, but more generally domestic as well - more transparent and, it is therefore to be hoped, easier and more understandable for those involved. This study takes as example the contemplated eastern enlargement of the EU to include some of the former centrally planned economies of central and eastern Europe (CEE). It is a case of particular complexity as the CEE countries are themselves each involved in an internal questioning of their values and beliefs, as they face the new challenges of the market economy.
Those directly involved in the analysis of western and eastern Europe developments should find this study of great interest. But it should also appeal to a much wider audience, either in relation with countries around the world where the issue of entering in supranational economic or political grouping with effect on agricultural and rural policy is relevant, or more generally in relation with the domestic debates. Indeed, the study also points up the importance of local divergences within countries. Thus I commend this study to all those interested in additional insights into the complex set of factors that influence the political debate behind agricultural and rural development.

CHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION
Looking for barriers
Looking for barriers
by Kate Hathaway and Dale Hathaway
This book explores the potential conflicts in one area of economic policy as the European Union enlarges to include countries of Central Europe that were from World War II until the 1990s a part of the communist bloc and governed by communist parties. The area of policy concern is agricultural policy, which for the countries in the European Union has been one of the most cohesive community-wide policies and is often referred to as the glue that holds the European Union together.
Beliefs and values
The approach used to examine the possible conflicts is to examine the beliefs and values held by policy leaders in Western Europe and in Central Europe on a series of issues considered to be basic to food, agricultural, and rural policies. The examination took place in a series of papers and commentaries on basic policy issues prepared by a group of distinguished scholars and policy makers from Western and Central Europe. The authors of these papers and commentaries then participated in a five day seminar in which the concepts and issues were examined in depth with special attention to how the beliefs and values differed or were similar from country to country.
In the context of this discussion a belief is defined as how persons think things are and a value is defined as how persons think things ought to be. Put differently, a belief is a perception of current reality and a value is a perception of how one would prefer current reality to be. The starting point of this examination of polices is the assertion that beliefs and values count in the process of building and maintaining functional policies. More will be said on the subject of how they count later in this chapter. It also was assumed that more than forty years of communist control of the countries of Central Europe had a profound impact on the beliefs and values of the people in those countries regarding food and agriculture. If so, these differences will lead to different policy pressures from those in Western Europe with its markedly different history.
Some persons argue that differences over agricultural policy are irrelevant insofar as enlargement of the EU is concerned to include countries of Central Europe. They assert that the overwhelming desire of the Central European countries to achieve the economic and political protection that membership in the EU affords is so great that they will accept whatever agricultural policies the EU demands for entry. This may be true, but it is not the end of the story. The modification of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) to accommodate the addition of countries with large agricultural sectors and many farmers is a certainty that has already begun in thought if not in action. Furthermore, as the discussions of the CAP later in this book point out, it is not a static policy and it will have to continue to be adjusted after the entry of the new countries in Central Europe. And, unless the EU substantially alters its decision-making structure the recent entrants will also play a
significant role in determining future policies.
It should be noted that at least for the next quarter century the politicians and policy makers in Central European countries will be persons whose formative years were under the old communist systems. Thus, it seems important and useful to understand how those systems influenced the beliefs and values relating to a crucial policy area.
The role of beliefs and values in policy formation^1
^1 Much of the information in this section was taken from the original paper of Michel Petit as delivered at the Seminar on Beliefs and Values Underlying Agricultural Policies, Lake Balaton, Hungary, September 19-23, 1996.
In modem times, an early interpretation of the role of beliefs and values in government interventions was provided by one of the project leaders for this study, in his book published more than 30 years ago. ^2 "Our government policies in agriculture represent an attempt to achieve, via government, certain widely-shared aspirations or values in our society."...
^2 Dale E. Hathaway, Government and Agriculture - Public Policy in a Democratic Society, McMillan, New York. 1963.
"In order to understand fully the nature of the public policies, it is necessary to understand the ends that are sought via such actions or the aspirations that underlie them. This is particularly true in agricultural policy, for, as we shall see, these aspirations relate to fundamental issues regarding how society should be organized and the desirable relationships between men."
However, the author was ambiguous regarding how beliefs and values affect policies. The above quotation from his first chapter suggests that policies are indeed determined eventually by the maximisation of a social utility function. Yet, in the third part of the 1963 book, where the policy process is described and a model of policy behaviour is presented, the fact that different groups in society have different beliefs and values is explicitly recognised.
A discussion of political processes must contain some implicit model of political behaviour. The earlier discussion of values and beliefs has pointed out that various groups within and outside agriculture have sharply different beliefs and values regarding agriculture. The model of political behaviour used assumes that the primary function of the political process is the compromising of these conflicting or competing values and the discerning of the relevant beliefs in a fashion that maximizes the satisfaction of the relevant groups in society. Such a view of the political process is a rejection of the concept that it is essentially and largely a process which derives the 'national interest' or the 'public good.'
More recently, a group of American authors clearly inspired by Hathaway's concepts have produced an examination of current beliefs and values affecting agriculture in the US, entitled Sacred Cows and Hot Potatoes ^3. It is interesting that the central perspective of these authors, as revealed by their subtitle, is to debunk myths affecting the agricultural policy debate in the United States: thus their intention is clearly normative. They want to correct what they view as mistakes and to promote a change in policies consistent with these corrections and with what they assert to be traditional, fundamental values. But they do not clearly spell out how modem policies that could respect such traditional values, as well as presumably better perceptions of the facts, i.e., better beliefs, could be designed.
^3 W.P. Browne et al., Sacred Cows and Hot Potatoes - Agrarian Myths in Agricultural Policies, Westview Press, Boulder, 1992.
A very different approach stressing the positive analysis of why policies are and what they are is probably more useful. This approach is very much inspired by the new political economy of such authors as Downs, Buchanan, Kruger, Olson, Stigler, etc. This literature, of the late 1960s and mainly 1970s, was not available when the Hathaway book was written in the early 1960s, but he clearly was a precursor of the new political economy, as argued earlier. ^4 Many of the intuitions in the third part of his book on the policy process fit very well with the new political economy literature, which is based in particular on a model of policy behaviour which assumes that policy actors seek not the public good but then-own interests.
^4 M. Petit, "For an Analytical Political Economy: Relevance to the Study of Domestic and International Agricultural Trade Policies," Paper presented at the Theodor Heidhues Memorial Seminar, Göttingen, Federal Republic of Germany, 1980.
If, as suggested elsewhere, economic interests shaped by long-term economic forces, are the main determinant of policies, ^5 is there any role for beliefs and values in the policy making process? Obviously beliefs and values have an important role to play, but the mechanism and the specific details of how that role is being played remains to be specified. One interpretation is that beliefs and values play a role at two levels.
^5 M. Petit et al., Agricultural Policy Formation in the European Community: The Birth of Milk Quotas and Cap Reform, Developments in Agricultural Economics 4, Elsevier, 1987.
First, they contribute to shaping the groups which become policy actors. Individuals do not have enough weight in the policy making process. To be influential, collective action is needed, but collective action requires the existence of collective actors. Individual actors will tend to join groups or to form groups with other individuals having the same interests. However, economic interests are extremely varied and never completely homogeneous. As a result collective action is never straightforward. The conditions and pitfalls for such collective actions have been well studied by Olson (1965). People sharing broadly common interests tend to have similar beliefs and values, and they form collective actors. One can assume that these common beliefs and values are important too for the cohesion of the collective actors.
The second role of beliefs and values is related to the fact that in any policy making process all the actors do not play equal roles. In particular, one puzzle raised by agricultural policy in many OECD countries is that consumers and tax payers do not seem to exert the influence which their interest and numbers would warrant. A commonly accepted explanation for this paradox has to do with the cost of information. For individual consumers to get organized collectively and become influential would entail costs for getting informed, active and influential on agricultural policy issues, which are not warranted by the benefits they would gain. So even though consumers are more numerous than farmers, they do not exert a great weight. For farmers the reverse is true. Indeed they have formed powerful organizations, and they have much greater influence than consumers on agricultural policies in Western Europe, as well as in other OECD countries.
In this context, a plausible hypothesis for the role of beliefs and values could be that consumers and tax payers, often the same people, i.e., the public at large, will tolerate a sectoral policy which may not serve their best interest, if that policy is not in too sharp a contrast with what they believe to be the situation of farmers and what they value as fair for the place of farmers in society. For instance, there is little doubt that in the USA the idea that family farms need to be protected has played an important role in maintaining agricultural policies which did not serve the best interest of consumers and tax payers. Whether or not the adopted policies actually protect family farms was not relevant as long as they were perceived to do so better than possible alternative policies.
Similarly, in Western Europe, the ideas that farmers are hard working, that they have made valiant efforts for adapting to new techniques and that, even though they are hardworking, they are not very well paid, and therefore deserve a special treatment, is very widely held. This set of beliefs and values commonly held in the public at large, as demonstrated by repeated opinion polls, has presumably played an important role in explaining why the Common Agricultural Policy has been so much tilted in favour of farmers against the interests of consumers and tax payers. So in the context of a pluralist society, where policies are the result of an evolving debate among various groups, social beliefs and values play an important role in determining what will be acceptable by society at large.
Whatever the explanatory model one accepts eventually, everybody agrees that beliefs and values are important. There is also widespread agreement on the fact that those beliefs and values change through time and that it is important to take into account the historical process of policy formation and evolution if one wants to provide meaningful explanations and be able, on the basis of these explanations, to predict something about the future. This consensus thus justifies the outline for this paper.
In the chapters that follow it is clear that nearly half a century of communist political and economic organization have left an indelible mark on the beliefs and values of persons in Central Europe. These appear to show up most sharply in different views relating to the role of agriculture in the economy and society, views on desired economic structure, and the belief that trade policy should be an extension of domestic price and income policy. The countries of Central Europe appear to be searching for an income policy for farmers, and it appears uncertain whether income policies will take the same direction as they have in the EU. On the issues of rural environment there are similar values as to the desired objectives, but the political dynamics relating to environmental issues appear markedly different. Because of the decades of communist neglect of rural areas, the former communist countries appear to have a higher priority on rural development than some of the countries
in the EU. In the case of food safety there appears to be a universal sharing of the desire for safe food supplies, and Central European countries are keenly aware that in order to compete in the markets in Western Europe, their products must meet high quality standards.
This book is not an attempt to suggest how the integration of Central Europe into the EU will evolve. It does, however, look at the policies of a key sector and suggest where in one way or another political and economic adjustments may be required.

CHAPTER 2 THE ROLE OF AGRICULTURE IN THE ECONOMY
The role of agriculture in the economy and society1
The role of agriculture in the economy and society: Group discussion and a commentary
The role of agriculture in the economy and society1
by Rolf Moehler
^1 Paper presented at the Seminar on Beliefs and Values Underlying Agricultural Policies, Lake Balaton, Hungary, September 19-23, 1996.
The history of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) can be seen as the history of attempts to limit the cost of support. But the need for support has only been questioned recently. Not surprisingly, justifications change over time. But it would be wrong to see in agricultural support only the work of an influential political lobby. As the opinion poll of Eurobarometer in 1988 has shown the population at large in the European Community is in its majority prepared to reserve a particular treatment to agriculture. As long as the cost of this policy appears to be manageable, the public is prepared to see agriculture not as an economic activity like many others.
The CAP has even an added value for European integration. The CAP has played a crucial role in European integration from the very beginning. As the CAP is intervening in the markets, it had an integrating effect which has gone much beyond agriculture. The market organizations created under the CAP were not only the first regulations of the Community with legally binding effect on the citizens of the member states, they gave also the European Commission wide-ranging responsibilities in managing the policy. Thus, the CAP became the blue-print for the way European integration works. Its techniques have been applied in many other areas of Community policy.
The following text tries to trace the values which are attached to agriculture from the beginning of the CAP until today. Against this background an attempt is made to assess the situation in the CEFTA countries (Poland, Czech and Slovak Republics, Hungary, Slovenia) too.
The changing role of agriculture in the economy
To illustrate the changes agriculture has undergone two sets of figures may be useful. The Stresa Conference in 1958 worked on the basis that employment in agriculture on average in the six original member states was 25 percent, whereas its contribution to GDP did not go beyond 14 percent. The respective figures for the Community of 15 in 1994 are 5.7 percent and 2.5 percent. A fraction of the workforce in the 1950s is now producing a much higher quantity of food. It is well known that this is due to technical progress through mechanisation, better seed and breeding qualities, better resource management etc. It is, however, surprising to note that this tremendous technical and economic development has certainly led to a change in values considered important, but not to a reversal of attitude towards agriculture.
The early days of the CAP
Already the report submitted by the heads of delegations to the six Foreign Ministers in April 1956, the so-called Spaak-Report, suggested a special treatment for agriculture. The reasons were the particular social structure around the family farm, the volatility of production, low elasticity of demand and differences in yields, input-prices and revenues between the different regions.
The five objectives of the CAP as laid down in Article 39 of the Rome Treaty^2 deal with the farmer and the consumer i.e., the society at large. The farmer is expected to increase his productivity and thus his standard of living, whereas the consumer can rely on sufficient supplies at reasonable prices. Stability of the market is thought to benefit both, the producer and the consumer.
^2 European Union, selected instruments taken from the Treaties, Book 1, Volume 1, published by the Office for Official Publications of the European Communities, Luxembourg, 1995, p. 151.
These objectives are broad enough to cover a more market oriented as well as a more interventionist policy. Therefore, Article 39 in its second paragraph gives some references for the elaboration of a common agricultural policy. The particular nature of agricultural activity which results from the social structure of agriculture and from structural and natural disparities between the various agricultural regions should be taken into account. However, the text does not forget to mention that agriculture "constitutes a sector closely linked with the economy as a whole." ^3 In Article 40 the Treaty rules out any discrimination among farmers or consumers within the Community. Although this does not preclude treating farmers in different situations differently, the provision lent support to the belief that the farming community is a homogeneous group of mainly family farmers.
^3 Ibid.
It is interesting to note that the 'specificity' of agriculture which played such a central role in the development of the CAP is not linked to climatic factors but to the place of agriculture in society and to regional disparities.
At the Stresa-Conference^5 in 1958, which laid the basis for the development of the CAP, Ministers of the six original member states stressed the importance of the fanning population for social stability. The family farm was recognised unanimously as the way to provide this stability. Mr. Houdet, the then French Minister was the most outspoken when he said that the State has to ensure that all farmers enjoy the appropriate income and their proper place in the economy and in society. The then-Commission President Walter Hallstein mentioned independence and freedom based on the ownership of his farm as the particular virtues of the European farmer. Judging from the speeches made and the reports submitted, employment in agriculture was not a major concern.
^5 Dokumente der Landwirtschaftskonferenz der Mitgliedstaaten der Europaischen Wirtschaftsgemeinschaft in Stres vom 3. bis 12. Juli 1958, published by Publication Service of the European Communities. Luxembourg 1959 (document 2116/1/59/5).
It was widely recognised that increase of productivity would lead to a diminishing workforce in agriculture. Depopulation of rural areas in France was mentioned, but not by the French Minister. Nobody, except the Belgian representative, mentioned the most basic task of the farmer, i.e., providing food for society. This, however, should not mislead us. It was not mentioned because it was so self-evident.
In post-war Europe the awareness that farmers produce an essential ingredient of life, namely food, was very strong. Despite industrialisation and urbanisation in Europe since the middle of the last century, the feeling that farmers had a special role in society as providers of food was wide-spread before the Second World War. The scarcity of supplies during the war could only enhance this feeling.
But there was even more to it. Rural life and thus the farmer had a symbolic value for all those who felt uncomfortable with or hostile to modernisation of society triggered by industrialisation and urbanisation. This is a recurrent feature of European civilisation which can already be found during the Roman Empire.
Summing up there were mainly three reasons justifying a specific appreciation of agricultural activity:
· the farmer is producing the most basic goods for human livelihood;
· the farmer is providing social stability through his hard work and the particular structure of the rural society;
· the farmer is, in his production, subject to the volatility of weather conditions.
The Community dimension added a fourth reason which became very powerful over time:
· the regional disparities which the Community was supposed to overcome.
These four aspects and the ingredient of cultural nostalgia ensured a particular place for the farmer in society. As the farmer is ensuring the livelihood of society, society has to ensure the farmer's livelihood. In addition he was still representing the good old times, when European countries were basically rural societies.
In such a specific relationship between farmer and society economic efficiency is not the overwhelming consideration for agricultural policy although it is present in Article 39 of the Treaty, which sees increasing productivity as the main vehicle for growth of income.
The implementation of the objectives of the CAP
Title II of the Treaty on the European Community does not rule out the option of meeting the objectives and other requirements of Article 39 by a mere co-ordination of agricultural policies pursued by the member states. This reflects the variety of support systems which existed in the 1950s in the different member states. But soon it became obvious that a common market for agricultural products could not function without a common policy. In order to enable free circulation of agricultural product, the support system had to be a uniform Community wide system. It was logical to finance such a system from Community and not member states resources and to establish a common import regime which in any case was called for by the requirements of a common commercial policy. In such a way the three fundamental principles of the CAP came to life: the common market, financial solidarity and Community preference.
The market organizations for all main production sectors which were created during the first 10 years of Community existence were, not surprisingly, biased towards stabilising markets and increasing the income of farmers which did not flow exclusively from increase of productivity. The consumer had to pay higher prices than world market prices, but he did not complain very much. In some member states prices even fell in comparison with the situation before the market organizations came into effect (e.g., for cereals in Germany). But the prices of food-stuff became less and less relevant when the general income level increased and the share of food in household expenditure diminished. At the same time the offer of food in terms of variety of products and quality improved considerably.
Despite relatively high market prices the traditional structures changed. Employment in agriculture fell with increasing mechanisation and the average size of exploitations increased. But this did not affect the essence of the traditional family farm.
The family farm can be small or big, as long as it provides the livelihood for a family. But a farm will not provide the livelihood for the family if it is not a profitable undertaking. The term 'family farm' implies, however, that the farm is more than an opportunity to make money. The added value is the attachment to the traditional values: attachment to the land, keeping the farm in the family for generations, active involvement of the farmer and his family in the running of the farm. In the Community of six member states there were not many which could not be considered as family farms because the owners lived elsewhere. There were, of course, considerable differences in the size of the exploitations. But in all the six member states the relatively small family farm was predominant. This did not change fundamentally with the enlargements in 1973, 1981 and 1986. Membership of Britain increased the number of large holdings but this was somewhat counterbalanced by the
rather small Greek and Portuguese farms, Denmark, Spain and Ireland being in the middle.
The family farm as the main type of Community farming and the flexibility this concept allowed, made it possible to treat farmers in the same way irrespective of differences in the size of the exploitation and income, in climatic conditions, etc. A notable exception was the additional support which farmers in mountainous and less favoured areas received.
From hindsight the 1960s were a good time for the CAP when most of the market organizations were completed, had there not been the Mansholt Plan^8. In its Memorandum on the Reform of Agriculture in the European Economic Community of December 1968, the Commission sought to deal with two problems which had arisen: emerging surpluses and the falling back of income growth in agriculture compared with the rest of the economy. The Memorandum talks about an explosive situation. It fears that the surpluses will undermine support for agriculture in society and that the growing disparity between farm and non-farm income will erode the contribution of agriculture to social stability. Unfortunately, the Memorandum with its proposals for reduction of arable areas and cow herds triggered the explosion: a very hostile reaction of the farming community. Not all was lost, however: The Mansholt Plan was the beginning of a structural policy on the Community level.
^8 Memorandum sur la reforme de l'agriculture dans la Communaute Europeene, Communication de la Commission des Communautes Européennes, document COM (68) 1000, Brussels 1968.
The watershed of the 1980s
Even without a Mansholt Plan Community agriculture was moving in the direction the plan had indicated, but much more slowly, of course. Going slow was possible because the British market opened up in 1973. Furthermore, the first oil-shock in 1972 increased world wide demand for agricultural products. But things were changing at the beginning of the 1980s and public perception of agriculture, too.
The second oil shock and the resulting world recession in 1979 made the bell ring for agriculture in the European Community. Ever increasing production which was met with shrinking demand led to huge stocks. These stocks could only be kept and disposed of with high costs. Around 70 percent of the Community budget went into agricultural support. Newspapers started to write about butter and beef mountains and wine lakes. The impression that something was wrong with the CAP spread.
Agriculture also came under attack because of its negative impact on the environment due to the application of pesticides and fertilisers. Sympathy for farmers did not evaporate and the perception that the farmer was entitled to support did not wane. But support was more and more considered excessive and the budgetary implications unbearable.
This shift in public attitude led to a number of measures to redress the situation in the 1980s, including the establishment of milk quotas in 1984 and the stabilisation measures in 1988. The basic problems, however, were only addressed in the reform of 1992 which allowed the completion of the Uruguay Round Trade Negotiations within the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) at the end of 1993. During the GATT-negotiations agriculture came for the. first time under massive pressure from industry to reform the CAP. As a satisfactory result for agriculture was a pre-condition for an overall deal, agriculture had to move. This does not mean that the 1992 reform was triggered only by the Uru
