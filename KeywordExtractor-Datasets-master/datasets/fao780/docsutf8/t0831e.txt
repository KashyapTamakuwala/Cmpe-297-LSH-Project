<title>Plant Tissue Culture:an alternative for production of useful metabolite</title>
<section>1</section>
SUMMARY
Higher plants contain a variety of substances which are useful medicines, food additives, perfumes, etc. However, decreased plant resources, increases in labour cost and other problems in obtaining these high-value added substances from natural plants have pointed toward the use of plant cell culture for production of the products. Because plant cell culture is not affected by changes in such environmental conditions such as climate or natural depredation, improved production may be available in any place or season.
Therefore, studies on the production of useful metabolite by plant cell culture have been carried out on an increasing scale since the end of the 1950's. The large scale cultivation of tobacco and various vegetable cells was examined in the late 1950's and early 1960's in the U.S., Canada, and Europe. Their results stimulated more recent studies on the industrial application of this technology in many countries.
Since plant cells can be cultivated in various fermentors in a similar way to microbial fermentations, many industrial companies in Japan have tried to apply this technology to commercial production of useful compounds because Japan has a highly developed fermentation technology. At present, two Japanese firms are manufacturing a plant pigment, shikonin, and ginseng cell biomass on a commercial scale and several other products including anti-cancer drugs seem to be close to commercialization.
However, there are still a few barriers which must be overcome before commercialization of many other products can occur. The production cost of metabolites is one of the problems because of the low productivity of cultured plant cells. In order to decrease the cost, increase of production efficiency per cell is an essential factor, which means that higher amounts of products must be produced as quickly as possible. A variety of approaches to improve the productivity of the culture have been tried and some of them were very effective.
In this review, the background of plant cell culture research, cost analysis, methods and facilities, various approaches to improve the productivity, and studies on production of a number of commercially interesting products which have currently been investigated are described.

CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION
Plant cell culture is viewed as a potential means of producing useful plant products such that conventional agriculture, with all its attendant problems and variables, can be circumvented. These problems include: environmental factors (drought, floods, etc.), disease, political and labour instabilities in the producing countries (often Third World countries), uncontrollable variations in the crop quality, inability of authorities to prevent crop adulteration, losses in storage and handling. Thus, the production of useful and valuable secondary metabolites in large bioreactors located in the consuming country is an attractive proposal. Additional advantages of such processes include: controlled production according to demand and a reduced and requirement.
However, this technology is still being developed and despite the advantages outlined above, there are a variety of problems to be overcome before it can be adopted on a wide scale for the production of useful plant secondary metabolites. The success of Mitsui Petrochemical Industry Co. Ltd. in Japan in producing shikonin on a commercial scale from Lithospermum erythrorhizon cultivations and that of Nitto Denko Co. Ltd. also in Japan in mass production of Panax ginseng or ginseng cells using 20 kL tanks have demonstrated that many of the problems can be overcome with perseverance. The economic feasibility of these processes is another question and this will be dealt with in a separate section.
In theory, it is anticipated that such large scale suspension cultures will be suitable for industrial production of useful plant chemicals such as pharmaceuticals and food additives, in a manner similar to that of microbial fermentation.
Nevertheless, there are some significant differences between microbial and plant cell cultures that must be considered when attempting to apply plant cell cultures to the available technology. Table 1 shows a comparison of some of the characteristics of plant and microbial cultures of relevance to fermentation.
This table serves to demonstrate some of the problems that can be encountered with plant cell cultures. The sensitivity to shear is due both to the large size of the cells and to the relatively inflexible cellulose cell wall. Thus, with normal blade impellers the cells may twist which will inhibit mitoses and, for this reason, air-lift fermentors are recommended by some researchers. The large size of the plant cell contributes to its comparatively high doubling time (12 h - several days), which thus prolongs the time required for a successful fermentation run.
The vacuole is the major site of product accumulation, and since product secretion is uncommon, the high metabolite yields seen in microorganisms that secrete product (thereby removing product inhibition of biosynthesis) cannot be expected. There is some ongoing research on membrane permeabilization of plant cells which may serve to relieve the constraints of product inhibition by facilitation of leakage into the extracellular medium. If this would also permit recycling of the biomass (e.g. via immobilization) it would help reduce production costs (1). The low aeration requirement for plant cells is an advantage over microbial cultures in general. In addition, the high cost of running a fermentation vessel over several weeks should be considered, although media costs are much less than those of animal cell cultures.

In addition to the problems outlined above, concerned with fermentation technology, there are also considerable hurdles to be overcome at the biochemical level. The two major problems concern poor expression of products and instability of cell lines.
Cultured plant cells often produce reduced quantities and different profiles of secondary metabolites when compared with the intact plant and these quantitative and qualitative features may change with time. The poor product expression is often attributed to a lack of differentiation in cultures (2). On the other hand, there are cases of cultures that over-produce metabolites compared with the whole plant (Table 2).
There are a number of examples of cultured cells producing metabolites not observed in the plant, eg. Lithospermum erythrorhizon cultures have been observed to synthesize rosmarinic acid (3). It has become apparent that the choice of original plant material having high yields of the desired phytochemical may be important in establishing high-yielding cultures (4). Furthermore, the need to repeatedly screen for high-producing lines (due to inherent instability of cell lines) has been emphasized, although the nutritional composition of the medium is also important (2). Thus, a variety of approaches are being investigated by many researchers to increase productivity of useful plant metabolites in plant cell cultures as seen in another section in this review.

CHAPTER 2
HISTORICAL BACKGROUND
As seen in many reviews (5-9), studies on the production of plant metabolites by callus and cell suspension cultures have been carried out on an increasing scale since the end of the 1950's. The large scale cultivation of tobacco and a variety of vegetable cells was examined from the late 1950's to early 1960's by Tulecke and Nickell at Pfizer Inc. (10), Mandels et at. at the Natick Laboratories in the U.S. Army (11), Street et al. at the University of Leicester (12) and Martin et al. at the National Research Council of Canada (13). Their results stimulated more recent studies on the industrial application of plant cell culture in many countries.
Since Japan has a highly developed fermentation technology, many industrial companies, in collaboration with some university groups (14), have tried to apply this technology for the commercial production of useful compounds. The Japan Tobacco Inc.'s interest involved around mass-production of tobacco cells as raw materials of cigarettes; the company established 20 kL fermentors which were the largest for plant cells in 1970's. Meiji Seika in Japan also elucidated the fundamentals of production of Panax ginseng cells in large volumes. Researchers reported that cultured ginseng cells stimulated physiological activities in animals in a similar fashion as elicited by native ginseng roots. The work was followed by Nitto Denko Co. which has been manufacturing cell mass of ginseng commercially. The cells are used as health foods in Japan. Researchers of Kyowa Hakko conducted extensive pharmacological screening of numerous cell cultures and found various novel products of great
interest, including plasmin inhibitory proteins in Scopolia japonica cells and plant virus inhibitors in cultured cells of Phytolacca americana and other species (15). The virus inhibitors of P. americana are now being studied by many research groups in the world because of their activity against AIDS and other animal viruses. Other firms such as Ajinomoto and Nippon Shin-yaku also made efforts to increase the level of accumulation of alkaloids, steroids and other secondary products in cultured cells.
Groups in Germany outlined very interesting approaches to industrial application (16) in the meeting held in 1976 at Munich, and their excellent results encouraged researchers in other countries. For example, Zenk and his colleagues (17) presented an impressive paper in which they successfully selected high-alkaloid producing cell lines of Catharanthus roseus using a method similar to the microbial mono-colony isolation technique. A number of laboratories in industries and universities followed Zenk's approach, and in fact, some researchers could increase significantly the level of secondary products such as ubiquinone-10, biotin, and various plant pigments produced by cell cultures.
In 1982, the 5th International Congress of Plant Tissue and Cell Cultures was held in Japan and about 70 out of 372 papers presented there related to production of secondary metabolites in cultured cells and several papers seemed to be commercially promising such as production of shikonin by Fujita et al. (19) of Mitsui Petrochemical and that of several antitumor compounds by Misawa et al. of Kyowa Hakko (20).
At subsequent International Congress of Plant Tissue and Cell Cultures in Minneapolis in 1986 and that in Amsterdam in 1990 as well as other meetings such as the Meeting of Primary and Secondary Metabolism of Plant Cell Cultures held in Giessen, Germany and the 4th and International Congress on Phytotherapy held in Munich, Germany in September, 1992, many compounds were shown to be accumulated by plant cell cultures and many different strategies were presented to increase their productivity. Means for production of those compounds include not only de novo synthesis but also biotransformation processes. A biotransformation process to produce ß-methyl digoxin using Digitalis lanata cells studied by Reinhard and Alfermann in Germany (21) was evaluated by Boehringer Mannheim Co. using 4 kL bioreactors although it has not yet been commercialized.
A combination of a plant cell culture process and a simple chemical coupling reaction was invented by a Canadian company, Allelix (22), to manufacture vinblastine as a commercially feasible process. The technology is now being studied by Mitsui Petrochemical in Japan for commercialization.
Sanguinarine production was also studied by Kurz et al. (82) in Canada since this alkaloid has a market in the denatal care field.
The recent biotechnology boom has triggered increase interest in plant cell cultures, for example, a number of firms and academic institutions in the U.S., Japan, Canada, and Europe have been investigating intensively the production of a very promising anti-tumor compound, taxol, using this technology.

CHAPTER 3
COST ANALYSIS
In spite of remarkable advances in plant cell culture technology, the production cost of metabolites is still high, as estimated by Zenk (5) and by Goldstein (1). The former calculated that the cost would be U.S. $500 per kg of isolated product when it was accumulated in 1 g/L within a period of 15 days in 100 m batch culture. It is true that the cost has decreased since his estimation in 1974, and the producing ability of 1 g/L for 15 days is achievable in the case of some compounds such as rosmarinic acid, but it is still too expensive to produce food stuffs, food additives or pharmaceuticals which can be more easily produced by alternative ways such as chemical synthesis, extraction from plants or by microbial fermentation.
Zenk stated that industrial plant cell culture techniques would be introduced only if the plant product under consideration is produced at a price equal to or preferably lower than the field-produced product. The only factor determining the industrial realization of plant cell culture is the price by which a given product can be produced.
A very detailed assessment of the costs entailed in theoretical processes has been made by Goldstein et al. (24). Four cases were considered:
A (Base state of technology)
Final biomass concentration = 200 g fresh wt./L
One day doubling time, biomass = 0.693/day
One day doubling time, product = 0.693/day
Product concentration = 0.05% fresh weight
Recycled biomass = 50%
B As for A, but:
One day doubling time, product = 6.93/day (10 times increase)
Recycled biomass = 90%
C As for B, but:
Final biomass concentration = 500 g fresh wt./L (2.5 times increase)
D As for C, but:
Product concentration = 0.5% fresh weight (10 times increase).
The final case (D) would translate into a production of 17.5 g product/L/day, which is well in excess of levels achieved with current technology. The rate of product formation is the major obstacle, but this could be compensated for by increased concentration of product. The calculated manufacturing costs and profit margin for each case assuming production of 10^4, 10^5 or 10^6 kg/yr are shown in Tables 3 and 4. Note that these figures reflect 1980 prices and will have increased since then.

* The selling price was calculated to take into account a 5-year payment on capital and a tax rate of 50%. The formula used was: Selling price/kg = 2 x manufacturing cost/kg + 0.4 (total invested capital/kg) = depreciation/kg.
In the case of scenario (D) with production of 10 kg/yr the selling price could be as low as $43/kg and the manufacturing cost would only be $18/kg. This assessment makes the future of commercial plant cell culture fermentation appear quite viable, but the crucial problems to be overcome are enhancing product levels, recycling the biomass (e.g. through immobilization) and raising the biomass concentration. Some encouraging advances in recent years suggest that these problems may be solved eventually, e.g. shikonin can be produced at a level of 23% of the dry weight (roughly 2.3% or more of fresh weight) and 4 g/L; rosmarinic acid can be produced at a rate of 1 g/L/day in Coleus blumei with a final concentration of 27% of the dry weight (23). A biomass concentration of 40 g dry wt./L was achieved.
Batch fermentation processes are capital intensive, requiring a high initial investment and sophisticated technology. In comparison with microbial cultures, doubling times are long and product yields are low. Furthermore, since production is often not growth-linked, there are many cases where two stage production is necessary, thus increasing costs markedly. Table 5 shows estimated costs for a hypothetical phytochemical produced by plant cell culture fermentation.

Assumptions: Annual production = 20,000 kg
Cell doubling time = 60 hr
Batch cycle time = 15 d

It has been calculated that if rose oil were produced in cell cultures, a fermentation process with a 20% share of the market would yield a net profit of $0.5 M/yr. This assumes a rose oil concentration of 10% dry weight and a cell density of 20 g dry weight/L (24). Fowler (25) suggests that plant products valued at $250-1,500/kg are acceptable production targets for an economically viable process. An initial market penetration of the world or U.S. market has been recommended at between 10 and 20%. This will depend on the size of the market and whether a plant cell fermentation process opens up new market.
Scragg (26) has calculated the effect of run time on productivity. Assuming a product yield of 1% dry weight, biomass yield of 20 g dry weight/L and a bioreactor volume of 1,000 L. A 300 day year was estimated, since time would be required for maintenance, contaminated runs, etc. Fig. 1 shows that as productivity decreases the requisite run time increases. Similarly, as the yield of product increases the reactor volume required decreases expotentially (Fig. 2). Under the conditions described above, a 100,000 L fermentor would be necessary to produce 300 kg/yr.

The most detailed assessment available in the literature for the production of a specific product in plant cell cultures is concerned with the production of ajmalicine from Catharanthus roseus cell cultures (27). In this case, a 20% market penetration was assumed, ie. 800 kg/yr and production was based on the use of a two-stage batch culture process. Stage two parameters include specific productivity of 0.26 mg/g/day (based on final dry weight), final product concentration of 0.06% dry weight and a maximum fresh weight concentration of 160 g/L. It was estimated that the cost of production would be $3,215/kg ajmalicine ($7.30/lb dry biomass) and this compares with $619/kg ($0.70/lb dry biomass) from the intact plant. Clearly, this 5-fold increase in costs is unacceptable from a commercial point of view. This example serves to illustrate the need to chose products that are particularly expensive to produce in the field. Shikonin is a good example, in that the long growing
period (3-5 years) and strict climatic requirements mean that the cost of the plant raw material is high $6.80/lb. It has been suggested that a quick way to assess the attractiveness of a cell culture method vs. conventional agriculture, is to calculate a specific biosynthesis rate "based on the final dry weight and the total time of fermentation or land occupation" (27). With shikonin there is a 830-fold increase in plant cell culture, whilst with ajmalicine from C. roseus there was only a 24-fold improvement.

CHAPTER 4
MATERIALS AND METHODS
4.1. Materials
4.1.1. Plants
In theory, any part obtained from any plant species can be employed to induce callus tissue, however the successful production of callus depends upon plant species and their qualities. Dicotyledons are rather amenable for callus tissue induction, as compared to monocotyledons; the callus of woody plants generally grow slowly. Stems, leaves, roots, flowers, seeds and any other parts of plants are used, but younger and fresh explants are preferable as explant materials.
Explants obtained must be sterilized using ethanol, sodium hypochlorite and/or other chemicals to remove all microorganisms from the materials and a typical sterilization procedure will be described later as an example.
4.1.2. Media
4.1.2.1. Inorganic Salts
To induce a callus from an explant and to cultivate the callus and cells in suspension, various kinds of media (inorganic salt media) have been designed. Agar or its substitutes is added into the media to prepare solid medium for callus induction.
One of the most commonly used media for plant tissue cultures is that developed by Murashige and Skoog (MS) for tobacco tissue culture (28). The significant feature of the MS medium is its very high concentration of nitrate, potassium and ammonia. The B5 medium established by Gamborg et al. (29) is also being used by many researchers. The levels of inorganic nutrients in the B5 medium are lower than in MS medium. Many other media have been developed and modified and nutrient compositions of some typical media will be described in Table 6. However, it is not always necessary to test many kinds of basal media when a callus is induced. It would be better to use only one or two kinds of basal media in combination of different kinds and concentrations of phytohormones. The most suitable medium composition should be optimized afterwards in order to obtain higher level of products as well as higher growth rate.
4.1.2.2. Carbon Sources
Sucrose or glucose at 2 to 4% are suitable carbon sources which are added to the basal medium. Fructose, maltose and other sugars also support the growth of various plant cells. However, the most suitable carbon source and its optimal concentration should be chosen to establish the efficient production process of useful metabolites. These factors depend on plant species and products, therefore it is necessary to optimize the medium compositions including carbon sources in each case. From an economical point of view, the use of more inexpensive carbon sources is appropriate in industry and crude sugars such as molasses have been examined.

4.1.2.3. Vitamins
The basal media described above such as MS medium include myo-inositol, nicotinic acid, pyridoxine HCl and thiamine HCl. Among these vitamins, thiamine is an essential one for many plant cells and other vitamins stimulate the growth of the cells in some cases. The level of myo-inositol in the medium is 100 mg/L which is very high although it is not clear whether such a high level of the vitamin is required.
4.1.2.4. Phytohormones
Phytohormones or growth regulators are required to induce callus tissues and to promote the growth of many cell lines. As an auxin, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) or naphthaleneaceic acid (NAA) is frequently used. The concentration of auxins in the medium is generally between 0.1 to 50 µM. Kinetin or benzyladenine as a cytokinin is occasionally required together with auxins for callus induction at concentrations of 0.1 to 10 µM. Other derivatives of auxin and kinetin are also used in some cases. Since each plant species requires different kinds and levels of phytohormones for callus induction, its growth and metabolites production, it is important to select the most appropriate growth regulators and to determine their optimal concentrations. Gibberellic acid is also added to the medium if necessary.
4.1.2.5. Organic supplements
In order to stimulate the growth of the cells, organic supplements are sometimes added to the medium. These supplements include casamino acid, peptone, yeast extracts, malt extracts and coconut milk. Coconut milk is also known as a supplier of growth regulators.
4.2. Methods
4.2.1. Preparation of Media
To prepare the medium, many researchers mix the stock solutions which were made previously since the medium compositions are generally complicated (30).
For example, MS medium is prepared as follows:
a. MS-Micronutrient stock solution (store in freezer)
Ingredient mg/100 ml
H[3]BO[3] 620
MnSO[4] 4H[2]O 2230
ZnSO[4] 7H[2]O 860
Na[2]MoO[4] 2H[2]O 25
CuSO[4] 5H[2]O 2.5
CoCl[2] 6H[2]O 2.5
b. Vitamins (store in freezer)
Vitamins mg/100 ml
Nicotinic acid 100
Thiamine HCl 1,000
Pyridoxine HCl 100
Myo-Inositol 10,000
c. Calcium chloride
CaCl[2] 2H[2]O 15 g/100 ml
d. Potassium iodide (store in amber bottle in refrigerator)
KI 75 mg/100 ml
e. 2,4-D (2.2 mM)
Dissolve 50 mg 2,4-D in 2 to 5 ml ethanol, heat slightly and gradually dilute to 100 ml with water. (Store in refrigerator).
f. NAA (2.8 mM)
Prepare the same as 2,4-D above.
g. Kinetin (1 mM)
Dissolve 21.5 mg of kinetin in a small volume of 0.5 N HCl by heating slightly and gradually diluting to 100 ml with distilled water. (Store in refrigerator) Similar procedures can be used for other cytokinins.
A certain volume of each stock solution is mixed and an appropriate carbon source is added to the mixture. After pH is adjusted to around 5.5 with 0.2 N K0H or 0.2 N HCl, distilled or deionized water is added to the mixture up to the certain volume required. Agar (0.6 to 1.0% wt/vol) is added for a solid medium.
The medium thus prepared is distributed into vessels such as Erlenmyer flasks (for example, 50 ml of the medium in a 300 ml volume Erlenmyer flask) and sterilized by using an autoclave at 120° C for 15 minutes. The sterilization conditions should be varied based on the volume of the medium and the size of the vessel.
4.2.2. Callus Induction
Explants are sterilized with 2% sodium hypochlorite solution and/or 70% ethanol solution. The period of time for submerging the plant materials in these solutions depends upon plant species, their parts and age. For example, a piece of stem of tobacco plant (approximately 3 cm in length) is submerged in 70% ethanal solution of 2-3 minutes and then in 1.2% sodium hypochlorite solution for 10 minutes. The explants should be rinsed with sterilized water.
The stem or any other part of plants thus sterilized is cut to approximately 1 cm in length using a sterilized scalpel and each piece is transferred with tweezers to a solid medium in a flask or a petri-dish. The plant material is incubated aseptically at around 25° C on the solid medium for several weeks or more and a callus is produced. The callus is subcultured by transferring a small piece to fresh solid medium. After several subsequent transfers, the callus becomes soft and fragile.
4.2.3. Suspension Culture
The growth rate of the suspension cultured cells is generally higher than that of the solid culture. The former is more desirable particularly in production of useful metabolites in a large-scale. A piece of the callus is transferred to a liquid medium in a vessel such as an Erlenmyer flask and the vessel placed on a rotary or reciprocal shaker. The culture conditions depend on plant species and other factors, but in general, the cells are cultivated at 100 r.p.m. on a rotary shaker at 25° C; some researchers are fond of much slower, or faster speeds. By subculturing for several generations, a fine cell suspension culture containing small cell aggregates and single cells is established. The time required to establish the cell suspension culture varies greatly and depends on the tissue of the plant species and the medium composition. The cells in suspension are also used for a large-scale culture with jar-fermentors and tanks.
4.2.4. Scaling-up
For commercialization, it is necessary to progress through several stages increasing the volume at each stage until the requisite bioreactor size is attained. In theory, it is anticipated that such large scale suspension cultures will be suitable for industrial production of useful plant chemicals such as pharmaceuticals and food additives, in a manner similar to that of microbial fermentation. Generally speaking, the culture period in plant cell cultures is longer than that in microbial cultures, and it is crucial to protect against microbial contamination.

EQUIPMENT AND FACILITIES
5.1 Laboratory
There are many textbooks describing very sophisticated laboratory systems for plant cell cultures. However, it is not always necessary to design special laboratories for this technology, but general microbiology laboratories can be used, although aseptic conditions are a prerequisite for incubation of plant cells as well as microbial cultures.
The following equipment is required:
Laminar air flow cabinets: The cabinets are commercially available in different sizes. They are placed in the laboratory where needed. If there is a sterile room, the cabinets are not always necessary.
Autoclave: Autoclaves in different sizes are commercially available.
Oven for dry sterilization: Although autoclaves can be used for dry sterilization, an oven is useful for sterilization of scalpels and glass-wares such as petri-dishes, pipets and others.
Equipment for sterilization by filtration: The medium containing carbon sources and growth regulators are simultaneously sterilized using a autoclave but sometimes aseptic filtration is favorable to avoid decomposition
