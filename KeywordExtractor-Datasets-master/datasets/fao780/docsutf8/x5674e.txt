<title>Inter-regional project for participatory upland conservation and development (Field Document 4/97) - Nepal - Participatory implementation in 1996 and 1997 of 26 community action plans formulated between october 1995 and january 1996 in the Bhusunde Khola watershed</title>
<section>1</section>
1.1 Background
The "Inter-regional Project for Participatory Upland Conservation and Development", GCP/INT/542/ITA (or PUCD project), aims at promoting people's participation in the conservation and development of upland catchments, in accordance with HMG's policies and priorities. The project became operational in the second half of 1992, and has gone through several participatory rural appraisal and participatory activity planning and implementation cycles. The three main categories of project activities are:
(i) Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) and participatory planning, and participatory monitoring and evaluation of planned activities;
(ii) Capacity building of user groups, which are the accepted community organizational units through which participatory field activities are implemented; and
(iii) Participatory implementation of field activities identified and requested by local communities through participatory planning methods (the main subject of this report).
The most comprehensive PRA and participatory planning exercise carried out during the project, covered 26 communities with about 8850 inhabitants of the Bhusunde Khola watershed^1 of Gorkha District (see Chapter 2.1 and Field Document 3/97). The PRAs were organized between October 1995 and January 1996, and resulted in 26 Community Action Plans (CAPs), which included 223 physical and training activities.
^1The Bhusunde Khola sub-watershed ranges from 500 - 1500 m in altitude and is located in the Middle Hills of Gorkha District. It has a total area of 32 km^2, covers 23 Wards of 4 Village Development Committees (VDC's), and has a population of approximately 12,000. There are no roads in the area and all transport is done on foot. No recent or detailed maps exist or could be used for planning or implementation purposes, except for the 1962 maps prepared by the Surveyor General of India, based on 1:80,000 air photographs taken in 1957.
This combination of a large number of CAPs covering 70-75 % of the population of a watershed is the closest thing we have to a participatory watershed management plan. It has many drawbacks, such as limited time frame, poor spatial integration of activities, and little homogeneity. However, it is the genuine product of a participatory planning process.
Gradual improvement of local capacity for planning and implementation of development activities is obtained by repeatedly going through cycles of capacity building training, participatory planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation.
Thus, it should be realized that a participatory (and integrated) watershed management plan looks quite different from a "traditional" watershed management plan, and more like a strategy, indicating working methods and target areas rather than fixed targets and zonations.
Implementation of these 26 CAPs became the main project focus during 1996. A high implementation rate was considered essential to prove the validity of the participatory development process, both at the field level and at the level of the Department of Soil Conservation.

1.2 Objective
The objective of this report is to document and report the participatory implementation of the 26 Community Action Plans of the Bhusunde Khola watershed as prepared by the local population through participatory planning methods between October 1995 and January 1996, and as implemented by the user groups with the assistance of the project in 1996 and the first half of 1997.
The report does not include the participatory implementation of: (i) Those activities that had been started before 1996, but could only be finished in 1996 or even 1997; (ii) New activities added through the Participatory Evaluation and Re-Planning workshops conducted between October and December 1996; nor (iii) Additional activities taken up to cope with unforseen situations (i.e. to assist communities in certain sensitive areas, not fulfilling the criteria for implementation).

2.1 1995/96 PRA and planning exercise
The main objective of the Participatory Rural Appraisal carried out in the Bhusunde Khola watershed between October 1995 and January 1996, was to improve the understanding of the local communities of their own situation, living conditions and environment in general, and their local resources, land use, farming systems, constraints and opportunities in particular, in order to set the stage for a participatory planning of development activities that would fit into an integrated and participatory watershed management plan (see Field Document 3/97).
The main objective of the Participatory Planning carried out together with the PRA was to prepare detailed plans for upland conservation and development activities to be implemented by the local population with the support of the project, and which would form the core of an integrated and participatory watershed management plan.
Field Document 3/97 presents the results of that PRA and planning exercise. It also describes methods and tools used and organizational aspects. The size of the communities where PRA's were conducted was small, usually between 30 and 80 households, and the duration of the PRA's was limited, especially to allow women to fully take part in the exercise. Data are presented on:
(a) Population and demography, including ethnic composition, literacy rates and local food sufficiency;
(b) Farming systems and landuse, including data on landuse categories;
(c) Crops and agricultural production, cropping patterns, seasonality, trend in productivity, problems and opportunities;
(d) Livestock and animal husbandry, numbers of animals per household, trends in livestock population, fodder and feed preferences, problems and opportunities;
(e) Forests and natural resources, including a summary of soil and water resources problem areas.
The 26 PRA communities have a total population of approximately 8,850 people, the whole watershed is estimated to have a population close to 12,000. The PRA focussed on settlements on the slopes and ridges of the watershed, and did not include settlements in the valley bottom (such as Bhusunde Bazaar).
As appears from the PRA data, there is a large diversity in the watershed, this concerns not only the natural variation of mountainous areas (slope, altitude, exposition, soil, and so on), but also sociological, ethnic and religious diversity. However, it should be noted that in general the whole population of the watershed should be considered as poor.

2.2.1 Participatory planning methods and tools used
Before starting the actual participatory planning of activities, the results of the PRA generated data were presented to the community for verification and comments in a feed-back or restitution meeting. This is also the starting point of the Village Planning Workshops, during which the following exercises were carried out, resulting in the formulation of a Community Action Plan (see also Field Document 3/97):
1. Verbal ranking of problems, during which a list of problems is drawn up (ideally this list should closely reflect the results of the presentation of the PRA data), this list also includes opportunities for improvement;
2. Prioritization of problems, which consists of a broad discussion and reshuffling of the listed problems;
3. Listing of activities, based on the prioritized problem and opportunity list; and
4. Prioritization of activities, based on the listed activities and a broad discussion on actual possibilities to carry out such activities.
2.2.2 CAP structure
The 26 Community Action Plans all follow the same structure. They indicate in the form of a table what the planned activities are, where they should be done within the communities, when they should be done, the number of beneficiary households, what the project should do, what other institutions should do, and what the community should do (see Table 1).
However, further analyses indicates that many activities are hidden, as can be seen from the Majhgaon (Chhoprak #7) example in Table 1 (see also Field Document 3/97 Table 24). Though only 6 activities are listed in the first column, further analysis of the 5th and 6th columns reveals some hidden activities, notably compost making training, forest management training and study tour, and fodder and forage training. Furthermore, it should be noted that there is a link between the different activities: waste water from protected water sources will be used in vegetable production; the forest should be protected and on-farm fodder production increased.

It is also important to note that other institutions than the project are expected to be involved in the realization of the CAPs, most often mentioned are the District Forest, Agriculture Development, Livestock Services and Drinking Water Supply Offices.
2.2.3 Types of activities included in the CAPs
The CAPs include many separate (but often inter-related) activities, including:
(a) Conservation activities, such as gully and landslide control, forest handover and management, conservation plantation and improved stoves;
(b) Small scale infrastructures, such as water source protection, water catchment ponds, small scale hill irrigation and trail improvement;
(c) Farming systems oriented activities, like livestock breed improvement, plantation of grasses, fodder, fruit, vegetables, nursery, and related training activities;
(d) Income generating activities, like vegetable and animal production and commercialization; and
(e) Social services, like the construction of community houses, a health center, latrines and adult literacy classes.
It should be noted that several factors influenced the planning process, most notably:
(i) Expectations of the local population of the kind of activities the project would (be able to) support.
(ii) Project policy on terms and conditions for the participatory implementation of activities, such as levels of subsidy. Here it should be noted that the project amended its implementation and subsidy policy shortly after completion of the PRA. Subsequently several communities/user groups wanted to amend their CAPs likewise.
(iii) The whole participatory planning procedure itself, and its focus on communities and user groups, favours the selection of activities that will benefit communities rather than individual households.
2.2.4 Size of CAPs
The 26 CAPs included a total of 223 activities, of which 177 could be defined as physical activities, and 46 as training activities (Table 2.). The number of activities per CAP was on average 8,6 and varied from only 1, in Nawalpur (Harmi #6) to 18, in Belbas (Khoplang #4).

Physical activities usually form the core of the CAPs. There were on average 3.8 times more physical activities than training activities in the PRAs, and only in 1 case were there more training than physical activities planned, namely in Nawalpur (Harmi #6). The were on average 6.8 physical activities, ranging from 0 in Nawalpur^2 (Harmi #6), to 14 in Belbas (Khoplang #4).
^2 In fact the Nawalpur PRA and Planning exercise was dominated by a few "radicals", who seemed to oppose any other activities than those proposed by themselves, i.e. improved stoves training.
Training activities were often hidden as accompaniment to physical activities. This reflects also the role of the facilitator. In a number of CAPs the planned number of training activities was very low, though other CAPs with similar physical activities also included specific and related training activities. This factor is particularly important in the organization of training events (i.e. communities that did not include training in their CAP should be invited for training events relevant to their physical activities). There were on average 1.7 training activities planned per CAP, ranging from 0 in Simpani (Ampipal #6), Chitre (Chhoprak #1), Katarbari (Chhoprak #3), Salbot (Chhoprak M), Faudargaon (Chhoprak #5), Firfire (Chhoprak #8), Harmi Bhanjang (Harmi #3) and Khurpajung (Khoplang #4), to 6 in Katubanse (Chhoprak #9).

2.3.1. Physical activities included in the CAPs
A physical activity is defined here as any activity with a direct physical component, such as construction, planting, providing improved genetic (breeding) material, handing over and management of forest. In fact, this category includes all activities except training and group formation.
A total of 177 physical activities were included in the 26 CAPs (see Table 3). The most popular activity, by far, was water source protection, with 52 sources included in the plans, though it is remarkable that none were planned in Ampipal VDC (maybe because of the presence of UMN community health programs).
Trail improvement, included 24 times, was the second most popular activity. Here it is important to note that trail improvement was most frequently included in the plans by communities living higher up the slopes, such as Chitre (Chhoprak #1).
Small scale hill irrigation was the third most frequently planned activity. It is likely that this activity is strongly limited by actual water resources, otherwise many more communities would have included it in their plans.
Gully and landslide control was mentioned 15 times. It is much more frequently included in the south facing slopes of the watershed.

Forest handover (community forestry) is included 10 times, and conservation plantation 6 times. These plantations are sometimes meant to improve the community forests and sometimes to help stabilize gullies and landslides.
Improvement of buffalo and especially goat was mentioned a number of times. The improved goats would generally be targeted at women and women groups.
Planting trees, fodder, fruit, grasses, bamboo, cardamom, vegetables, etc., is included in many CAPs. Many variations exist, such as planting on private farm land, communal lands, in gullies, forests, along streams, etc.
It is remarkable that none of the CAPs included plans to increase the availability of improved paddy or maize seed, fertilizer, pesticides or other food production enhancing interventions, except for irrigation facilities. It is not clear why this is so, maybe farmers do not realize that crop production is very low (less likely), or maybe they only see irrigation as a solution upon which all other improvements would depend (more likely).
2.3.2 Criteria for project assistance
As stated before, user groups are the appropriate and accepted community organization units through which participatory field activities of the Department of Soil Conservation (or any other line agency) are to be implemented. At the beginning of the Second Phase (end 1994) there were about 35 user groups in the Bhusunde Khola watershed, however, many of these were not functioning properly.
The project considered that it was not sustainable to work with purely input driven user groups, who otherwise hardly function. Therefore criteria were set early in 1996 for user groups who wished to solicit project assistance. It was decided to work only with active user groups defined by:
(i) Regular meetings;
(ii) Record keeping; and
(iii) Regular group savings.
Later another criterium was added:
(iv) Self initiated activities.
Thus, even in communities where PRAs had been carried out and CAPs had been prepared, the project insisted that it would only extend its assistance in physical activity implementation to active user groups according to the above set criteria. In case the community was eager to implement the physical activities foreseen in the CAPs, but was not properly organized in user groups fulfilling the criteria, the project offered specific capacity building training.
2.3.3 Cost sharing and people's contribution
Basically, only field activities identified and requested by local communities through participatory planning methods have been supported by the project since its inception. Modalities for cost sharing and participatory implementation of field activities have not remained constant throughout this period, though in general user groups contributed un-skilled labour and local materials, and the project contributed skilled labour and outside materials. During the first phase, the project tried to stimulate user groups by providing them with cash equivalent to 10% of the total estimated costs of specific -usually small scale infrastructure- activities, which should have been used as revolving funds (and which did not have the desired results).
During 1995 user groups were required to deposit 5% of the total estimated costs of such activities in their bank account before the start of the activity. After completion of the works an equal sum of money was deposited on the same accounts by the project. Several problems arose with this system:
(i) Poor communities could not manage to collect enough funds;
(ii) In some cases relatively wealthy people provided the 5% funds, and were later reimbursed by the user group upon completion of the activities and receipt of the additional 5% of the project;
(iii) Only in a few cases did the revolving funds actually work, more often it gave rise to mistrust and misunderstanding (and sometimes misuse) in the user groups; and
(iv) Villagers lost interest in activities that require very high levels of unskilled labour and low levels of external inputs, notably trail improvement and gully and landslide control.
It was therefore decided in February 1996 to amend the project activities implementation strategy, no longer to require cash deposits for infrastructure activities, and to streamline subsidy and cost sharing policies with the other district level line agencies' norms and policies as follows:
(a) Gully and torrent control, people's contribution in the form of unskilled labour would amount to no less than 25-30% of the total cost;
(b) Trail improvement, people's contribution in the form of un-skilled labour would amount to no less than 40% of the total cost;
(c) Water source protection/water supply and small scale hill irrigation, people's contribution would include all un-skilled labour (including labour for the supply of local material), while the project would provide skilled labour and external materials;
(d) Degraded land rehabilitation, people's contribution would consist of pitting and "social fencing", the project would provide planting material;
(e) Fruit tree planting, when fruit trees were to be planted in rehabilitation schemes, people would be charged 50% of the nursery cost, when fruit trees were to be privately planted as a pure income generating activity, people would be charged 100% of the nursery cost, and the project would arrange for transport;
(f) River bank and road stabilization, people's contribution in the form of un-skilled labour would be not less than 1 5-20% of total costs;
(g) On farm conservation, in general, people's contribution in the form of un-skilled labour would amount to at least 50% of the total costs (except for those activities that fall under above mentioned categories, where the said subsidy rates would apply);
(h) Other activities within the scope of the Department of Soil Conservation, as a general rule, external materials and skilled labour would be provided by the project and un-skilled labour as people's contribution; and
(i) Livestock improvement, the project would arrange for transport only.
2.3.4 Participatory feasibility analysis
After completion of the 95/96 PRA and Planning exercise, it was evident that the list of activities proposed by the CAPs needed to be further screened through a participatory feasibility analysis. This was done in the period of February - April 1996.
The participatory feasibility analysis focussed on social, technical and environmental aspects, while economic aspects were considered less relevant:
(i) Social aspects includes the verification whether direct stake holders actually agree with every detail of the proposed activity, e.g. landowners should agree that a water pipe will run through their land.
(ii) Technical aspects includes the verification whether the proposed activity is technically possible, e.g. whether water for a proposed small scale hill irrigation scheme can actually reach the farm land, and whether it will be enough to irrigate the proposed area.
(iii) Environmental aspects includes the verification whether the proposed activity will have a positive or negative impact on the environment, e.g. whether a proposed trail will increase the risk of a landslide or provoke gully formation.
(iv) Economic aspects. To date, the project has not carried out actual economic feasibility analysis. Only a minority of proposed activities would qualify for such an analysis (i.e. income generating activities), but there is also a clear reluctance to carry out such analysis (i.e. the local conviction that nothing in the hills of Nepal is economically feasible). However, intrinsic economic criteria have been used in the feasibility study, notably the numbers of beneficiary households as compared to cost of activities.
Apart from these, the earlier stated project criteria for user groups and cost sharing were also utilized as screening tools. Finally, it was realized that some CAPs were far too ambitious to be carried out in 1 or even 2 years, and therefor the criterium of available local workforce (manpower) was added.
The participatory feasibility analysis were carried out by the Area Facilitators of the project, mid-level technicians of multi-disciplinary backgrounds: rangers (foresters), an overseer (engineering) and a junior technician agriculture. Regular back-stopping support was provided by the senior project staff.
The results of the participatory feasibility analysis and related screening methods are presented in Table 4. A total of 81 physical activities, or 46% was screened out: 9 (5%) were outside the project mandate; 24 (14%) were not feasible for social, technical or economical reasons; 16 (9%) could not be done because the user groups did not (want to) fulfill the criteria; and 32 (18%) were "postponed" because there was not enough labour available in the community to complete them (in fact more had to be postponed, but only from 1996 to 1997).
Of the engineering activities (gully control, trail improvement, water source protection, irrigation and catchment ponds), which with 121 proposed activities made up 68% of the physical activities in the CAPs, a total of 62, equivalent to 51% was screened out. The main problem in gully control is the high cost and large amount of labour required. Trails are especially labour intensive, but usually otherwise feasible. Proposed irrigation schemes and ponds often do not meet technical requirements.
Forest handover and management (community forestry) is sometimes not feasible because of social conflicts (user rights). Forest plantations (conservation forests) were often not feasible, because the project insisted on effective social fencing before it would agree to make any payments to user groups. Those that were feasible were part of more elaborate gully control works.
Improved breeding animals was considered not a project activity in the case of buffalo's, here farmers could apply for specific loans with other institutions. Improved goats however was retained, because this activity particularly benefits women groups.

Usually all planting activities are feasible, except when it is done as an income generating activity, such as the proposed nursery and some of the proposed vegetable production schemes (no market).
A community health center is clearly not within the project mandate. Latrines could be within the mandate, as long as it would only be training, however communities wanted latrines to be installed in every household.
It should be pointed out, that in fact more of the proposed activities could not be implemented in 1996 than suggested by Table 4. Several activities took more than one year to complete - especially gully control works-, while others were rescheduled during a series of Participatory Evaluation and Re-Planning workshops organized between October and December 1996.
Clearly, there was a major gap between activities identified in the CAPs, and those still within the workplan after feasibility analysis and other screening methods were applied. Thus, there is scope for improvement of the CAP planning process.
2.3.5 Design of small scale engineering works
First of all, it should be understood, that in the context of rural Nepal, one has to be careful before making a formal design of a small scale engineering work, because whichever office or institute makes the design is expected to also take care of its implementation. Therefore, it is wise to only make designs of those works which one can actually also implement. This is the reason that the project limited its design activities to those that it would subsequently support for implementation. Several other feasible activities were said to be "taken over" by other line agencies, notably the District Development Council and the District Water Supply Office, as well as one of the Village Development Committees. These activities are not further dealt with in this or the subsequent paragraph, but will be included in the lists of "implemented activities" in paragraph 2.3.7.
Gully control and landslide treatment consists of gabion checkdams and/or dry stone walls, accompanied by biological conservation measures. Trail improvement consists of enlargement and paving with stone slabs of steep footpaths. Water source protection includes capturing of a source and construction of a water holding tank, laying of water pipes and installation of one or more water taps per source. Small scale hill irrigation consists of the tapping of water from small streams, and guiding through narrow channels or pipes to cropland.
A major effort has gone in the design of the feasible small scale engineering works. These designs include detailed estimates in volume and quantity of different works, such as stone quarrying, sand transport, trench digging, masonry, preparation of gabion boxes, and so on. Unit rates are used to determine costs and/or labour time to prepare each particular detail. Standard rates are used for volumes of work per labour day. District rates are used to calculate cost of skilled and un-skilled labour. Market prices are used to estimate the cost of outside materials.
Thus a first step is the design and calculation of actual costs of proposed activities. This implies a lot of field work and involves direct beneficiaries in the tracing of channels, trails, and the like. Secondly and based on the detailed estimates as well as the criteria for cost sharing, calculations are made to determine project costs and user group contribution.
These designs and calculations are made by the concerned area facilitator, assisted -if necessary- by another mid-level technician with particular expertise. Subsequently these designs and cost estimates are presented to the Assistant Soil Conservation Officer for verification. Once satisfied the ASCO recommends the activity to the District Soil Conservation Officer and the Chief Technical Advisor for implementation. A final screening is done to compare proposed activities with available budgets.
It is important to note that sometimes during implementation the need/desire arises to change the design. Though these changes are often minor (e.g. size of cement slab in front of a water tap), they are sometimes major, in particular in the case of gully control works. Therefore a certain flexibility is always required.
2.3.6 Implementation costs and agreements
Of the proposed activities that passed the participatory feasibility analysis and other screening methods, the small scale engineering works were by far the most expensive - at least for the project (see also para 2.3.3 on cost sharing and people's contribution). Conservation plantations can also be costly, depending on their size, but no agreement could be reached on implementation conditions of any of these, thus they were not included in the project workplans for 1996 and 1997.
The estimated implementation costs (excluding project
