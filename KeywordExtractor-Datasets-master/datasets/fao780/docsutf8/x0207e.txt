Executive summary
Executive summary
At the tenth Liaison Officers Meeting of the Programme for the Integrated Development of Artisanal Fisheries in West Africa (IDAF) in Lome, gender issues in artisanal fisheries in West Africa were featured, and useful recommendations on follow up activities were made. These activities include the collection of information on women's activities in artisanal fisheries. Although women's participation in fishing and fishing-related activities is widely recognized, women's work is often associated with family support only. Consequently, apart from their contribution in terms of family support, little is known about women's role in the wider economy, and their contribution in accumulating wealth. In order to subscribe to filling this gap in the artisanal fisheries subsector, the Programme for Integrated Development of Artisanal Fisheries in West Africa (IDAF) planned and implemented a study on costs, earnings, and expenditure structures of fisherwomen, fish processors and fish
traders. This report gives the results of the study conducted in Ogheye, Delta State, Nigeria.
The objective of the study was two-fold. First, to develop and implement cheap and viable research methods to study costs, earnings, and expenditure structures of women involved in the artisanal fisheries sub-sector. Second, to collect information on the following issues: investment costs, operational costs and sources of funds, women's income; the profitability of women's activities; social obligations and the structure of expenses; marketing channels; and the role and structure of socio-professional organizations.
Ogheye has a population of 4,500, consisting of about 785 adult women. All these women are involved in fishing and fishing-related activities. In fact, it is their major source of income. Apart from fishing, processing and marketing of fish and fish products, women play an important role in buying and selling their husband's catch as well as the catch of other fishermen. Further, women are responsible for household activities, such as the preparation of food, cleaning the house, and child care. They also play an important role in maintaining social networks at family, neighbourhood, and community level.
Three combinations of fishing and fishing-related activities of women can be distinguished, (a) fishing-processing-marketing, (b) processing-marketing and (c) fishing-marketing. Within each of these categories different fishing methods and/or species can be distinguished. Apart from this, most women finance or invest in other people's activities by supplying inputs.
The total investment cost is highest for women involved in fishing, processing and marketing of demersal and pelagic species ([DEL: N :DEL] 385,875). Second are women involved in smoking fish and crayfish and thus requiring a smoking unit. Women involved in fishing and marketing of periwinkle and crab bear the least investment cost ([DEL: N :DEL] 3,500 and [DEL: N :DEL] 4,000 respectively). Since these are sold fresh, no smoking unit is needed. The low investment cost of periwinkle processing and marketing ([DEL: N :DEL] 3,500) can be explained by the fact that this activity does not require smoking. Processing in this respect refers to parboiling and extraction of the muscles from the shell.
Women involved in processing and marketing crayfish bear the highest variable cost ([DEL: N :DEL] 230,553). Second is gillnet + hook and line fishing, processing and marketing ([DEL: N :DEL] 126,631). In the first case it is mainly the quantity of fish bought for smoking that results in the high figures, while in the case of gillnet + hook and line units the high figure is due to high expenses on fuel.
The variable costs are lowest for fishing and marketing, [DEL: N :DEL] 40 for crab, while women involved in periwinkle fishing and marketing did not report any variable cost at all.
The monthly sales are highest for women involved in fishing, processing and marketing of fish ([DEL: N :DEL] 276,657) and the processing and marketing of crayfish ([DEL: N :DEL] 260,000). In both cases this can be explained by the high quantities processed and the relatively high selling price. Monthly sales are lowest for women involved in periwinkle processing and marketing ([DEL: N :DEL] 10,667) and in periwinkle fishing and marketing ([DEL: N :DEL] 12,200). This is mainly due to the very low selling price per kilo.
Profitability rates range from 4.5% for women involved in gillnet fishing, processing and marketing to 46.1% for women fishing and marketing crab. The relatively high rates in fishing and marketing periwinkle and crab must mainly be attributed to the low investment costs and thus low monthly depreciation costs. Looking at the other figures suggests that the higher the investment costs of the activity, the lower the profitability rate. It must be noted that these figures are based on production levels during the low season.
In the income women have at their disposal to continue their economic activities and to fulfil household responsibilities, the following elements can be distinguished: their own net revenues from fishing, processing and marketing; revenues from additional sources of income; revenues from financing and investment in other people's fishing activities (in kind); contributions from their husband (in cash and in kind), credit, and the cost of depreciation.
Women's expenses consist of household expenses, working capital to continue fishing and fishing-related activities; financing and investment in other people's fishing activities; and savings and contributions. Household expenses include food, education, pocket money, clothing, rent, drinks, gifts to relations and the repayment of loans, and constitute an average of [DEL: N :DEL] 6,296 per month. Working capital refers to the variable costs of women's fishing and fishing-related activities. Financing and investment in other people's fishing activities takes place in the following ways: supply of fishing equipment and materials, family arrangements; moneylending; and provision of fuel. Returns are primarily in kind. Finally, women spend a considerable amount of money on savings and contributions of different kinds. Most savings are made with osusu groups or so called thrift collectors while contributions are made to societies, family ceremonies and church. These constitute an
average of [DEL: N :DEL] 2,290 per month.

1. Introduction
1.1 Background of the study
At the tenth Liaison Officers Meeting of the Programme for the Integrated Development of Artisanal Fisheries in West Africa (IDAF) in Lome, Togo, gender issues in artisanal fisheries in West Africa were featured, and useful recommendations on follow up activities were made. These activities include the collection of information on women's activities in artisanal fisheries. Although women's participation in fishing and fishing-related activities is widely recognized, women's work is often associated with family support only. Men are still regarded as '`breadwinners", while women are their "helpers", or generally referred to as partners of men in supporting families. In this respect, women's contributions in terms of labour or money are easily regarded as non-economic, and thus relegated to the reproductive realm. Consequently, apart from their contribution in terms of family support, little is known about women's role in the wider economy, and their contribution in
accumulating wealth.
In order to subscribe to fulfilling this gap in the artisanal fisheries subsector, the Programme for the Integrated Development of Artisanal Fisheries in West Africa (IDAF) planned and implemented a study on costs and earnings, and expenditure structures of fisherwomen, fish processors and fish traders. This report gives the results of the study conducted in Ogheye, Delta State, Nigeria.
1.2 Objective of the study
The objective of the study was two-fold First, to develop and implement cheap and viable research methods to study costs, earnings, and expenditure structures of women involved in the artisanal fisheries subsector. Second, to collect information on the following issues:
o investment costs and sources of fund
o operational costs and sources of funds
o income
o profitability of activities
o social obligations and the structure of expenses
o marketing channels
o the role and structure of socio-professional organizations
1.3 Structure of the report
After this brief introduction and the methodology discussed in Chapter Two, Chapter Three describes living and working conditions of women in Ogheye. Both household characteristics and fishing and fishing-related activities are received. In describing the latter, a distinction is made between three combinations of activities, (a) fishing-processing-marketing. (b) fishing-marketing, and (c) processing-marketing. In each of these combinations different fishing methods and/or species have been taken into account. Chapter Four presents the mainly quantitative results on costs and earnings of the women, including investment costs, variable costs, fish prices, sales, net revenues, and profitability of their activities. After discussing the composition of their income, Chapter Five gives insight in their expenditure pattern and the way they use the money that is at their disposal. A distinction is made between household expenditure, financing and investing in other people's
activities, and savings and contributions. The section on savings and contributions also covers the structure and functions of socio-professional organizations. Finally, Chapter Six presents the conclusions.

2. Methodology
2.1 Study area; Ogheye
This study has been conducted in Ogheye, a fishing village on the right bank of the Benin River (annex I). It is also the last settlement facing both the sea and the estuary in. Delta State, which occupies the western part of the Niger Delta. It has a tropical climate characterized by two distinctive seasons; the dry and the rainy season. The dry season is from November to April, and the rainy season starts in May and lasts until October, with a brief stop in August, commonly referred to as the August break. From December to February, the dry Harmattan wind blows over the state. The average annual rainfall is 266.7 centimeters with an average temperature of 30°C (80°F). Ogheye is located on cleared red mangrove (Rhizophora sp) area. The salinity in the river channels is as low as 0.5-4 ppt. during the rainy season and 15-33 ppt. during the dry season. The surface water temperature in the mangrove area varies from 26°C to 28°C.
Ogheye has a population of 4,500 people (Nigerian Population Bureau, Census 1991), composed of four different tribes, Isekiri, Ilaje, Ijaw, and Uhorobos. Apart from Nigerians, a significant number of Ghanaians reside in Ogheye. However, an ethnic conflict between the Isekiri and the Ijaw seriously reduced both the population and the number of canoes at the time of the study. Since the beginning of the conflict in April 1997, most Ghanaians, part of the Ilaje, and the Ijaw left the place. The latter are hiding in a nearby river system. During the same period the number of canoes declined from 675 to 402 (350 planked canoes and 52 dugouts).
However, Ogheye was already selected as study site before the escalation of the conflict. The most important reason for selecting Ogheye was because of good research experiences in this village in the past. The people in Ogheye are receptive and accomodating when it comes to data gathering for research purposes, partly because the village has often been a site for pilot projects of both the Nigerian government and international agencies.
2.2 Selection of respondents
The respondents were selected through a short pilot survey in the village. This survey showed that women are involved in three combinations of activities, (a) fishing-processing-marketing, (b) fishing-marketing, and (c) processing-marketing. Within each of these categories different fishing methods and/or species can be distinguished. Apart from prawn fishing, the sample selected represents all combinations of activities observed at the time of the study. Table I gives an overview of the composition of the sample.

TOTAL
Although most women in Ogheye are involved in fishing, processing and marketing, a relatively small number of them is represented in the sample. This is explained by the relatively low level of fishing activities due to the ethnic conflict. For the same reason, prawn fishing is not represented in the sample.
2.3 Methods of data collection
Data have been collected from 3 June to 4 July 1997. Research methods have been mostly participatory, meaning that women actively participated in the process of data collection. Apart from a literature review, research methods consisted of questionnaires with structured and open questions for both fisherwomen (annex II) and fish processors (annex III), daily report sheets (annex IV and V), group discussions, and the observation of women's activities. Women of the Eghoroke Better Life Society participated in several group discussions and they served as intermediaries between the researchers and women in Ogheye.
The questionnaires have been used to collect data on household characteristics, fishing and fishing-related activities, marketing channels, financial arrangements between women and fishermen, and the operations and role of socio-professional organizations. The daily report sheets aimed to collect daily information on costs and earnings of women's fishing and fishing-related activities and on their use of income. Observations and measurements were made to cross-check data obtained through the questionnaires, daily report sheets and group discussions.
2.4 Extrapolation of the results
As already mentioned, this study is based on data collected for a month period in the low season. Most women's activities were on a relatively low level, except crayfish fishing. Another factor that affected the volume of catch landed and hence the processing and marketing output during this month is the ethnic conflict between the Ijaws the Isekiri, afflicting the area since April 1997. Women are afraid to spend long hours on the water either to fish or to travel to sell their product elsewhere. Besides, since the Ijaw, the Ghanaians and part of the Ilaje have moved from Ogheye, they could not be included in the study.
It must be realized that this low level of activity has clearly influenced the results of the study. Apart from exceptionally low monthly sales, net revenues and profitability rates of women's activities presented in Chapter 4, the low level of activity is expected also to be reflected in women's household expenses, savings and contributions, and finance and investment strategies presented in Chapter 5. Therefore, extrapolation of data has been avoided as much as possible.

3. Women in Ogheye
The population of Ogheye consists of about 785 adult women (Nigerian Population Bureau, 1991). All of them are involved in fishing and fishing-related activities. In fact, it is their major source of income. Apart from fishing, processing and marketing of fish and fish products, women play an important role in buying and selling their husband's catch, as well as the catch of other fishermen. Furthermore, women are responsible for household activities, such as the preparation of food, cleaning of the house and child care. They also play an important role in maintaining social networks at family, neighbourhood and community level.
3.1 Household characteristics
The household size of the women interviewed ranges from 6 to 34, including their husband, their children, co-wives, relatives, and other children These figures apply to women of different marital status. Sixty-five (65) percent are married, 10% are divorced, 10% are widowed and 15% are single. Among the women that are married, 68% have one or more co-wive(s). Fourty-five (45) percent of the women are their husband's first wife, 45% are their husband's second wife, while 10% of them take the position of third or fourth wife. On average, women have 6 children of their own.
Apart from their involvement in fishing and fishing-related activities, women are responsible for household activities and satisfying household needs. Men are expected to contribute in cash or in kind, to providing initial capital for women to start their own economic activities, and/or to sell their catch to their wives. In fact, only 32% of the women in the sample receive household contributions from their husbands, in 25% of the cases the husband actually provided the starting capital for the women's businesses, and more than 50% of the women buy fish from their husband on credit and/or against a favourable price. In most of the other cases, at least one of the fishermen women buy from is a relative.
In practice, many households are male headed but female dominated Most household decisions are taken by the first wife. She controls the distribution of her husband's catch to his wives and she allocates shares of his contributions in cash and in kind to her co-wives, according to their position and the number of children All women in the household are responsible for feeding and clothing their own children In case women are single, divorced or widowed, and in case husbands do not make household contributions (68%), women bear all financial responsibilities towards their household.
3.2 Fishing and fishing-related activities
Three combinations of fishing and fishing-related activities of women can be distinguished; (a) fishing-processing-marketing, (b) processing-marketing and (c) fishing-marketing. Apart from this, most women finance or invest in other people's activities by supplying inputs. This section describes women's activities in each of these combinations.
3.2.1 Fishing-processing-marketing
Most of the women in Ogheye are involved in fishing, smoking as well as marketing activities. These women fish, smoke their own catch and sell it. Apart from processing their own catch, most of them buy fish in addition. In fishing, women target fish (species), prawns and crayfish, using gillnets, hook and line, shelters, screens and different types of traps. All fishing methods, except that of prawns, are covered in the sample.
Gillnet
Gillnet fishing requires a 9 or 1 2-planked canoe (canoe consisting of 9 or 12 planks), a 25Hp engine, fishing gear and a crew of 2-3 people. Women use gillnets with varying mesh sizes (6, 9 or 12 inches). They go out fishing twice a day, in the morning (4h-11h) and in the afternoon (15h-19h). Species targeted depend on the season, demersal species during the rainy season and pelagics during the dry season. In the rainy season women fish close to the shore while in the dry season they go much further out to sea. On these long trips, most women do not take an active part as crew members, since they are too busy smoking fish onshore.
Hook and line
Hook and line fishing is combined with gillnet fishing. This fishing method is either used at the same time or alternated with gillnet trips. Except for the fishing gear, hook and line fishing requires the same equipment as gillnet fishing Species landed by gillnet and hook and line units are Croacker (Pseudotolithus sp), Snapper (Lutjanus sp), Grunt (Pomadasys sp), Shinynose (Polydactylus quadrifilis), Catfish (Arius sp), Grouper (Epinephelus sp), and Barracuda (Sphyraena sp).
Crayfish
Crayfish (Nematopalaemon hastatus) can be found in high salinity river mouths, large creeks and coastal waters of about 15 ppt. They are most abundant during the months of June-November with peaks between July and August. However, crayfish occurs throughout the year in smaller quantities (Marioghae, 1980).
The fishing equipment and materials of women involved in crayfish fishing consists of a dugout canoe and conical traps, locally called "ekobi", which are made of cane using synthetic twine to hold it together The number of conical traps owned by women varies between 20-60 The traps are set at low tide, near the river bank and retrieved during high tide. They can also be used in the creeks. It must be noted that the equipment and materials used by men targeting crayfish are different. Most of them use active stow nets, requiring a 9-planked canoe and a 25Hp engine.
Prawns
In Ogheye, prawns (Macrobrachium vollenhovenii, Macrobrachium macrobrachion and Desmocaris sp) can be found in the brackish water creeks with a peak season between November and March. Smaller quantities occur throughout the year. In the main channel, prawns can only be found in the period from April to June (Powell, 1982).
Prawn fishing requires either fence traps or shelters, baskets, and a dugout canoe. Fences are erected along the banks of the river, the traps are placed at intervals. The traps are inspected and emptied twice a day at low tide. Women in Ogheye widely use so called "basket traps", requiring a relatively large dugout canoe. Each canoe carries water hyacinth (Eichornia crassipes), stakes, palm fronts or any type of leave, to provide shelter or shade for the prawns to hide. The plants, leaves or fronts are coralled at the river banks. A woman can own up to 20 of these shelters. In order to collect the prawns, the shelters are lifted gently, held over a receiving basket and shaken vigorously to dislodge the catch.
3.2.2 Fishing - marketing
Women involved in fishing and marketing deal with either periwinkle (Tympanotonus fuscata/radula, Tympanotonus fuscata, and Pachymelania aurita) or crab (Callinectes amnicola, Ocypode africana, Sersama sp, Ocypode africana). Periwinkle picking only requires a dugout canoe and long hours of bending, picking and selecting the shells. Undersized shells reduce the market value. During the rainy season, women pick between 67 and 113 kilos per day. Fresh periwinkles are stored in bags, and covered with fresh leaves that are watered occasionally for moisture retention. They are sold at creek junctions to avoid offloading and loading in the village.
Crab can be found in the mouth of the estuaries and in the main river channel. They occur throughout the year with two peaks, from June to October in the main channel and from April to December in the creeks. Crab is most expensive in December when the females are producing eggs.
Crab fishing requires a dugout canoe and so called "bicycle wheels". These, a ringed wire or the middle of a two hundred liter drum, are used with discarded fishing net attached to them. Since in Ogheye crab fishing is a popular activity, nets are designed to stretch across the circumference of the wheel or ring. A twine is tied to the circular frame and attached to a float or lead line. The traps are baited with fish, but the most effective bait is a piece of chicken or a dead rat. The number of traps women own ranges between 5 and 20. They drop the trap singly into the water attached to the float, at well spaced intervals. After dropping all the traps, women go back to the first to start lifting and inspecting. This cycle continues until they take a break, and remove the traps from the water. If women leave the traps without watching, the crab will take the bait and swim away with it. The whole operation is carried out by walking in the water near the river banks, or
occasionally from a dugout canoe in the middle of the river.
Catch rates vary according to the season. During the high season women catch 120-180 kilogrammes per day' in 4-6 hours fishing. During the low season 60-90 kilogrammes are landed (National Agricultural Research Project, 1996). Crabs are stored in baskets and covered with fresh leaves to reduce the direct effect of the sun and to minimize dehydration. They are sold Ogheye to buyers from Koko, Sapele, Warri or even Benin City.
3.2.3 Processing - marketing
The third combination of activities consists of fish processing and marketing. Women involved in these activities buy fresh fish to process and sell afterwards. In Ogheye, fish processing mainly refers to the smoking of fish. The fish smoked consists of species from gillnet and hook and line units (during the rainy season these are mainly demersals), trawler by-catch, and crayfish.
Before smoking, demersal species are cut into equal pieces and placed on a drying rack. Several layers of fish can be placed on one oven. During smoking, the fish is covered on the top and the four sides with straightened drums. The fire place, which is open, is covered with four pieces of zinc roofing sheet. On average, women own four ovens which have to be watched by one or two persons, depending on the quantity and type of fish being smoked. The fish has to be turned over at intervals to avoid charring of the product. Smoking large species takes 4-6 hours.
Crayfish smoking requires more preparations than the smoking of demersals. They have to be washed first to remove sand and other debris. After washing, women spread out the crayfish on a raised mat for excess water to drain out and sun drying. During smoking, the fire is not continuous. They only build it with intervals. The crayfish and the fire place are covered with zinc to retain the heat. Once the heat becomes too intense the sides are uncovered to release excess heat and to avoid burning. Smoking crayfish takes 24 hours of expert tending of the fire. Smoked crayfish is stored in bags and kept on a rack in the smoking unit, with occasional fires to avoid deterioration. Most of the product is sold in Ogheye, or customers collect their product in Koko, Sapele or Warri. In this case, customers bear the cost of transportation and handling charges.
Unlike the processing of demersals and crayfish, periwinkle processing does not require a smoking unit. Periwinkles are parboiled to loosen the muscles from the shell and to allow for easy extraction with a needle. Processed periwinkle is sold in cups.

4.1 Investment costs
To estimate the investment costs of women's activities, current market prices of the different items were used as reference. Table 2 and 3 show the investment costs of fishing units and smoking units respectively.

The investment cost of fishing units varies from [DEL: N :DEL] 3,500 to [DEL: N :DEL] 165,500, depending on the type of gear used. Investment costs are highest for gillnet ([DEL: N :DEL] 165,000) and hook and line units ([DEL: N :DEL] 155,000). This can be easily explained by the fact that these are the only fishing units operated by women, equipped with a planked canoe and an engine. Besides, the gillnet is a relatively expensive gear. All other fishing activities of women are characterized by much lower investment costs, requiring only a dugout canoe and relatively cheap fishing gear. Investment costs are lowest for periwinkle picking ([DEL: N :DEL] 3,500) which does not require any fishing gear at all, meaning that women only need a dugout canoe for their operations.
Apart from demersal and pelagic species targeted by gillnet and hook and line units, crayfish is also targeted by both women and men. However, women exclusively engage themselves in the low cost alternative, using conical traps that only require a dugout canoe, while men use active stow nets requiring a planked canoe and an engine. In case women own stow net units, they prefer to hire them out to men.
A gillnet and hook and line fishing unit consists of at least one 9-planked canoe, at least one engine, one or more gillnets and about 200 hooks with a life span of 7, 5, 4 and 2½ years respectively. The life span of the smaller gears used varies from 4 months for conical traps, 2 years for the traps attached to fences, to 3 years for "bicycle wheels". A dugout canoe generally lasts for about 7 years.
The investment cost for fish processing is constituted by the cost of a smoking unit on average containing four ovens and the cost of a dugout canoe to transport fish to and from the market Table 3 shows the investment cost of fish processing and marketing

Since most women are involved in several activities at the same time, three combinations of activities have been distinguished: fishing-processing-marketing; fishing-marketing, and processing-marketing. Table 4 gives an overview of the total investment cost of different combinations of fishing and fishing-related activities. If the cost of a dugout canoe is already included in the smoking unit, it is left out in calculating the investment cost of the fishing unit (like in the case of the fishing, processing and marketing of crayfish).

All women involved in fishing use more than one piece of gear. Besides, gillnet fishing and hook and line fishing are combined. On average, the gillnet/hook and line units in the sample consist of 1 2/3 canoes, 1 2/3 engines, 2 1/3 gillnets and 200 hooks In crayfish and crab fishing women averagely use 5 conical traps and 5 "bicycle wheels" respectively. The investment cost in the table above are based on these numbers.
As the table shows, total investment cost is highest for women involved in fishing, processing and marketing of demersal and pelagic species ([DEL: N :DEL] 385,875). Second are women involved in smoking fish and crayfish and thus requiring a smoking unit. Women involved in fishing and marketing periwinkle and crab bear the least investment cost ([DEL: N :DEL] 3,000 and [DEL: N :DEL] 4,500 respectively). Since periwinkle and crab are sold fresh, no smoking unit is needed. - The low cost of periwinkle processing and marketing ([DEL: N :DEL] 3,500) can be explained by the fact that this activity does not require smoking. Processing in this respect refers to parboiling to loosen the muscle and extraction from the shell.
The starting capital of women in the sample varies from [DEL: N :DEL] 50 to [DEL: N :DEL] 25,000, depending on the type of activity and when they started their activities. Women in the sample started 2-60 years ago with an average experience of 16 years. Most of the women started their activities with a loan (32%). For 43% of them the initial capital was a gift from their parents or husband, while 25% used personal savings to start their activities.
4.2 Variable costs
The variable costs of women's activities refer to operating costs. These depend on the level of activity and on the combination of activities they are involved in. Table 5 gives an overview.
