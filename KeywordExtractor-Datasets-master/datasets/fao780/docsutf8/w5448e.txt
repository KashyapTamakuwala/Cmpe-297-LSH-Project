PREPARATION OF THIS DOCUMENT
The first edition of the manual "Introduction to tropical fish stock assessment" was prepared by the FAO/DANIDA project "Training in fish stock assessment and fisheries research planning" (GCP/INT/392/DEN) for use in a series of regional and national training courses on fish stock assessment.
In 1984 the author, Per Sparre, was asked to write it on the basis of lecture notes and case studies prepared by the team of lecturers engaged in the courses. The first edition was printed in July 1985 in Manila, the Philippines, and distributed by the project through the Network of Tropical Fisheries Scientists of the International Center for Living Aquatic Resources Management (ICLARM) and training courses.
In 1989 the manual underwent a thorough revision by Mr. P. Sparre, Dr. E. Ursin, former Director of the Danish Institute for Fisheries and Marine Research, and Mr. S.C. Venema. This version was published in 1989 as FAO Fisheries Technical Paper 306.1 (Manual) and 306.2 (Exercises).
In 1991, when the stock was nearly exhausted, it was decided to undertake another thorough revision, placing emphasis on didactical aspects, correction of errors and at the same time, cross referencing with the computer program FiSAT (FAO/ICLARM Stock Assessment Tools) that had been developed in the meantime.
In 1994 Dr. Ursin prepared new texts to replace sections that had proven to be inadequate and partly to add new examples and some extensions to the methods contained in the manual. These new texts can be found in Section 2.6: Bhattacharya method, Section 3.4: Comparison of growth curves, phi prime, Section 5.2: Cohort analysis with several fleets, Section 6.2: Estimation of gill net selection, Section 8.3: Mean age and size in the yield, Section 8.6: Short and long-term prediction and parts of Section 8.7: Length-based Thompson and Bell model.
The opportunity was used to revise the documents again, at the same time correcting errors pointed out by translators and users, whose contributions are gratefully acknowledged.
It should be noted that new figures, tables and formulas have been assigned new unique numbers, which do not overlap with any of the deleted numbers used in previous versions. The figures were partly revised in Chile by Messrs. P. Arana and A. Nuñez. Typing and word processing was taken care of by Ms. Jane Ugilt in Denmark.
Similar versions have already appeared in Portuguese and Spanish and will appear in Indonesian and Thai.
Earlier versions have been translated into Chinese, French and Vietnamese.

FAO Fisheries Technical Paper. No. 306/2, Rev. 2. Rome, FAO. 1999. 94 p.
ABSTRACT
In Part 1, Manual, a selection of methods on fish stock assessment is described in detail, with examples of calculations. Special emphasis is placed on methods based on the analysis of length-frequencies. After a short introduction to statistics, it covers the estimation of growth parameters and mortality rates, virtual population methods, including age-based and length-based cohort analysis, gear selectivity, sampling, prediction models, including Beverton and Holt's yield per recruit model and Thompson and Bell's model, surplus production models, multispecies and multifleet problems, the assessment of migratory stocks, a discussion on stock/recruitment relationships and demersal trawl surveys, including the swept-area method. The manual is completed with a review of stock assessment, where an indication is given of methods to be applied at different levels of availability of input data, a review of relevant computer programs produced by or in cooperation with FAO, and a
list of references, including material for further reading.
In Part 2, Exercises, a number of exercises is given with solutions. The exercises are directly related to the various chapters and sections of the manual.

17. EXERCISES
The exercises are numbered according to the numbers of the relevant sections of the manual.
Exercise 2.1 Mean value and variance
In this exercise we use part of the length-frequency data of the coral trout (Plectropomus leopardus) presented in Fig. 3.4.0.2, namely those in the length interval 23-29 cm. These fish are assumed to belong to one cohort. The length-frequencies are presented in Fig. 17.2.1.
Tasks:
Read the frequencies, F(j) from Fig. 17.2.1 and complete the worksheet. Calculate mean, variance and standard deviation.

Exercise 2.2 The normal distribution
This exercise consists of fitting a normal distribution to the length-frequency sample of Exercise 2.1, by using the expression:
for a sufficient number of x-values allowing you to draw the bell-shaped curve.
For your convenience introduce the auxiliary symbols:
so that the formula above can be written
Since A and B do not depend on L and as they are going to be used many times, it is convenient to calculate them separately before-hand.
Tasks:
1) Calculate A and B
B = -1/(2s^2) =
2) Calculate Fc(x) for the following values of x:

3) Draw the bell-shaped curve on Fig. 17.2.1
Exercise 2.3 Confidence limits
Tasks:
Calculate the 95% confidence interval for the mean value estimated in Exercise 2.1.
Exercise 2.4 Ordinary linear regression analysis
It is often observed that the more boats participate in a fishery the lower the catch per boat will be. This is not surprising when one considers the fish stock as a limited resource which all boats have to share. In Chapter 9 we shall deal with the fisheries theory behind this model.
The data shown below in the worksheet are from the Pakistan shrimp fishery (Van Zalinge and Sparre, 1986).
Tasks:
1) Draw the scatter diagram.
2) Calculate intercept and slope (use the worksheet).
3) Draw the regression line in the scatter diagram.
4) Calculate the 95% confidence limits of a and b.

Exercise 2.5 The correlation coefficient
Refer to Exercise 2.4. Does the correlation coefficient make sense in the example of catch per boat regressed on number of boats? Consider which of the variables is the natural candidate as independent variable. Can we (in principle) decide in advance on the values of one of them?
Tasks:
Irrespective of your findings in the first part of the exercise carry out the calculation of the 95% confidence limits of r.
Exercise 2.6 Linear transformations of normal distributions, used as a tool to separate two overlapping normal distributions (the Bhattacharya method)
Fig. 17.2.6A shows a frequency distribution which is the result of two overlapping normal distributions "a" and "b". We assume that the length-frequencies presented in Fig. 17.2.6B are also a combination of two normal distributions. The aim of the exercise is to separate these two components. The total sample size is 398. Assume that each component has 50% of the total or 199. Further assume that the frequencies at the left somewhat below the top are fully representative for component "a", while those at the bottom of the right side are fully representative for component "b".

Tasks:
1) Complete Worksheet 2.6a.
2) Plot D ln F(z) = y' against x + dL/2 = z and decide which points lie on straight lines with negative slopes (see Fig. 2.6.5).
3) On the basis of the plot select the points to be used for the linear regressions. (Avoid the area of overlap and points based on very few observations). Do the two linear regressions and determine a and b.
5) Draw the two plots which represent each distribution in linear form.
6) We now want to convert the straight lines into the corresponding theoretical (calculated) normal distributions. Using Eq. 2.2.1 calculate Fc(x) for both normal distributions for a sufficient number of x-values to allow you to draw the two bell-shaped curves superimposed on Fig. 17.2.6B. Assume n = 199 for both components. (Use the same method as presented in Exercise 2.2). Complete Worksheet 2.6b.

Exercise 3.1 The von Bertalanffy growth equation
The growth parameters of the Malabar blood snapper (Lutjanus malabaricus) in the Arafura Sea were reported by Edwards (1985) as:
K = 0.168 per year
L[¥ ]= 70.7 cm (standard length)
t[0] = 0.418 years
Edwards also estimated the standard length/weight relationship for Lutjanus malabaricus:
w = 0.041 * L^2.842 (weight in g and standard length in cm)
as well as the relationship between standard length (S.L.) and total length (T.L.):
T.L. = 0.21 + 1.18 * S.L.
Tasks:
Complete the worksheet and draw the following three curves:
1) Standard length as a function of age
2) Total length as a function of age
3) Weight as a function of age

L[¥ ]= 14 cm
q = 0.02332
K = 1.0 per year

Exercise 3.2.1 Data from age readings and length compositions (age/length key)
Consider Table 3.2.1.1 (age/length key) and suppose we caught a total of 2400 fish of the species in question during the cruise from which this age/length key was obtained and that only 439 specimens of Table 3.2.1.1 were aged. The remaining fish were all measured for length. To reduce the computational work of the exercise only a part (386 fish) of this length-frequency sample is used. This part is shown in the worksheet.
Tasks:
Estimate how many of these 386 fish belonged to each of the four cohorts listed in Table 3.2.1.1, by completing the worksheet.

Exercise 3.3.3 The von Bertalanffy plot
Cassie (1954) presented the length-frequency sample of 256 seabreams (Chrysophrys auratus) shown in the figure. He resolved this sample into normally distributed components (similar to Fig. 3.2.2.2) using the Cassie method (cf. Section 3.4.3) and found the following mean lengths for four age groups (cf. Fig. 17.3.3.3):
A

C
D
age group
mean length
(inches)
D L/D t
Note: a Gulland and Holt plot gives (cf. Columns C and D): K = -0.002 and L[¥ ]= -950 inches, which makes no sense whatsoever.
Tasks:
1) Estimate K from the von Bertalanffy plot.
2) Why does it not make sense to ask you to estimate t[0]?
Fig. 17.3.3.3 Length-frequency distribution of 256 sea breams. Arrows indicate mean lengths of age groups as determined by Cassie (1954)
Exercise 3.4.1 Bhattacharya's method
Weber and Jothy (1977) presented the length-frequency sample of 1069 threadfin breams (Nemipterus nematophorus) shown in Fig. 17.3.4.1A. These fish were caught during a survey from 29 March to 1 May 1972, in the South China Sea bordering Sarawak. The lengths measured are total lengths from the snout to the tip of the lower lobe of the caudal fin.
Figs. 17.3.4.1B and 17.3.4.1C show the Bhattacharya plots for the data in Fig. 17.3.4.1A, where B is based on the original data in 5 mm length intervals and C on the same data regrouped in 1 cm intervals. You should proceed with Fig. C for two reasons: 1) because it appears easier to see a structure in Fig. C than in Fig. B and 2) because the number of calculations is much lower.
Tasks:
1) Resolve the length-frequency sample (1 cm groups, Fig. C) into normally distributed components and estimate thereby mean length and standard deviations for each component. Use the four worksheets and plot the regression lines.
2) Estimate L[¥ ]and K using a Gulland and Holt plot. Draw the plot.
3) Do you think the analysis could have been improved by using Fig. B (5 mm length groups) instead of Fig. C (1 cm groups)?

Exercise 3.4.2 Modal progression analysis
Fig. 17.3.4.2A shows a time series over twelve months of ponyfish (Leiognathus splendens) from Manila Bay, Philippines, 1957-58. (Data from Tiews and Caces-Borja, 1965; figure redrawn from Ingles and Pauly, 1984). The numbers at the right hand side of the bar diagram indicate the sample sizes, while the height of the bars represents the percentages of the total number per length group.
Fig. 17.3.4.2B shows a time series of six samples of mackerel, (Rastrelliger kanagurta) from Palawan, Philippines, 1965. (Data from Research Division, BFAR, Manila; figure redrawn from Ingles and Pauly, 1984).
Tasks:
1) Fit by eye growth curves to these two time series, trying to follow the modal progression (as was done in Fig. 3.4.2.6). Start by fitting a straight line and then add some curvature to it, but do not be too particular about it. (Actually one should have carried out a Bhattacharya or similar analysis for each sample, but because of the amount of work involved in that approach, we take the easier, but less dependable, eye-fit. This exercise aims at illustrating only the principles of modal progression analysis - not the exact procedure).
2) Read from the eye-fitted growth curves pairs of (t, L) = (time of sampling, length), and use the Gulland and Holt plot to estimate K and L[¥ ]. Assume that the samples were taken on the first day of the month. Read for Leiognathus splendens only the length for the samples indicated by "*" in Fig. A, as the figure is too small for a precise reading of each month. Use the worksheet.
3) Use the von Bertalanffy plot to estimate t[0].

Step 3: Divide FRQ/MA by M and subtract 1
Examples:
0.870/1.083 - 1 = -0.197 h)
0.714/1.083 - 1 = -0.341 i)
3.000/1.083 - 1 = 1.770 j)
Step 4a: Count numbers of "zero neighbours" among the four neighbours (two zeroes added to each end of the sample).
Step 4b: De-emphasize positive isolated values: For each "zero-neighbour" the isolated point is reduced by 20%:
and if there are "zero-neighbours" then multiply this value by [1 - 0.2 * (no. of zeroes)]
Examples:
1.610 * (1 - 0.2 * 2) = 0.966 k)
0.154 * (1 - 0.2 * 1) = 0.123 l)
1.770 * (1 - 0.2 * 2) = 1.062 m)
1.308 * (1 - 0.2 * 3) = 0.523 n)
Note: In the most recent version (Gayanilo, Soriano and Pauly, 1988) the de-emphasizing has been made more pronounced by using the factor:
Step 4c: Calculate sum, SP, of positive (restructured) FRQs and calculate sum, SN, of negative (restructured) FRQs and calculate the ratio R = - SP/SN
Example:
SP = 0.966 + 0.123 + 1.062 + 0.523 = 2.674
SN = -0.197 - 1 - 0.340 - 1 - 1 - 0.076 - 0.230 - 1 = -4.845
R = - SP/SN = 2.674/4.845 = 0.552 o)
then multiply this value by R. Values > 0 are not changed.
Examples:
-0.197 * 0.552 = -0.109 p)
-0.231 * 0.552 = -0.123 q)
FRQ (55) = 0 r)
Plot the points in the diagram (Fig. 17.3.5.1B).
Step 6: Calculate ASP (available sum of peaks). Identify the highest point in each sequence of intervals with positive points (a "sequence" may consist of a single interval)
Examples:
0.966 is the highest point in the positive sequence 10-15 cm s)
1.062 is the highest point in the positive sequence 45-45 cm
0.523 is the highest point in the positive sequence 60-60 cm
ASP = 0.966 + 1.062 + 0.523 = 2.551

Exercise 3.5.1a ELEFAN I, continued
This exercise aims at illustrating the importance of the choice of the size of the length interval (cf. Exercise 3.4.1).
Fig. 17.3.5.1C1 shows a length-frequency sample (from Macdonald and Pitcher, 1979) of 523 pike from Heming Lake, Canada, grouped in 2 cm length intervals. There are five cohorts, determined on the basis of age reading of scales with the mean lengths shown in the following table:
age
years
mean length
cm
standard deviation
cm
These data put us in a position to test ELEFAN I.
Fig. 17.3.5.1C2 shows the normally distributed components derived from scale readings, and Fig. C3 shows the restructured data.
Except for the largest fish ELEFAN I manages to place the ASPs (indicated by arrows) close to where the "true" mean lengths of the cohorts are, but like all other methods ELEFAN I has difficulties in handling the largest (oldest) fish.
Tasks:
Repeat the restructuring using Worksheet 3.5.1a on the basis of 4 cm intervals (see worksheet figure) instead of 2 cm intervals. Compare the results with those presented in Figs. 17.3.5.1C1 and C2.

Exercise 4.4.6a The Jones and van Zalinge method applied to shrimp
Carapace length-frequency data for female shrimp (Penaeus semisulcatus) from Kuwait waters, 1974-1975, from Jones and van Zalinge (1981), are presented in the worksheet below. L[¥ ]= 47.5 mm (carapace length). Input data are total landings in millions of shrimps per year by the Kuwait industrial shrimp fishery.
Note: In this case the length intervals have different sizes, because the length groups have been derived from commercial size groups, which are given in number of tails per pound (1 kg = 2.2 pounds).
Tasks:
1) Determine Z/K by the Jones and van Zalinge method using the worksheet.
2) Plot the "catch curve".
