PREPARATION OF THIS DOCUMENT.
The basis of this document was a set of agreed principles arising from the FAO Expert Consultation on Economic Incentives and Responsible Fisheries held in Rome from 28 November to 1 December 2000. A first draft was produced after an extensive literature search and field-tested in four participating countries. This led to a much improved second draft that was discussed in the FAO Expert Consultation on Identifying, Assessing and Reporting on Subsidies in the Fishing Industry held in Rome from 3 to 6 December 2002. This version of the Guide was produced in early 2003. It is hoped that this document will be treated as a working paper and will be revised and improved as more experience in the subsidies sector is gained. The Guide provides detailed and practical advice to fisheries professionals who identify, assess or report on subsidies in the fisheries sector. It is expected that those who lead a subsidy study will have studied economics or business at a University level. However, it is hoped that the Guide will also be used and understood by biologists, decision-makers and others who are directly or indirectly involved in the fisheries sector. The various drafts, as well as the final version of the Guide, have been written by Ms Lena Westlund. Distribution: FAO Fisheries Department FAO Regional and Subregional Offices Other interested nations and national and international organizations.
FAO Fisheries Technical Paper 438 consists of ten chapters and three appendixes. After a brief introduction to the background of the document, the Guide starts in chapter 2 by explaining to the reader how it should be used. In chapter 3, it discusses how to prepare for a study of fishery subsidies. Then, before getting into more detailed advice on the study itself, a discussion follows on "what is a fisheries subsidy?" and "what are the various categories of subsidies?" in chapters 4 and.
This part of the document is directed at those who are not familiar with the issues surrounding subsidies in fisheries. Chapter 6 is the core of the Guide. Here the reader is exposed to the use of different assessment methods. The emphasis is on how to determine the government cost ­ or revenue ­ and the value to the industry of a subsidy. The value of a subsidy to the industry is reflected in costs and earnings it causes. Chapter 7 discusses the measurement of these factors in further detail. The following chapter deals with the relative importance of fishery subsidies and gives ideas with regard to how comparative analyses can be carried out. The final two chapters discuss reporting and also give a summary of the Guide. Appendixes I and II present respectively a Glossary and a review of other subsidy classifications. Appendix III lists additional examples of possible subsidies under different categories.

Chapter 1 A fisheries subsidies guide.
This Guide has been developed to assist in studying fisheries subsidies. It aims at being an instrument for studies covering all different types of subsidies in all sectors of the fisheries industry and attempts to provide a flexible technical tool that can be used by those who carry out studies and prepare reports on subsidies in the fisheries sector according to their specific needs. As such, the Guide does not provide a rigid definition of subsidies but offers a framework for how to define fisheries subsidies and it discusses and suggests definitions of different types of subsidies. The Guide does not take any position with regard to whether a subsidy is "good" or "bad". Subsidies can increase or decrease revenues and costs of the industry, but the analysis of how this impact on industry profits eventually affects resources and trade is beyond the scope of the Guide. Hence, the Guide does not cover the analysis of the effects of subsidies on resources, fisheries and trade but aims at assisting in collecting and organizing the data on which these analyses could be based. This covers defining, classifying and quantifying fisheries subsidies as well as investigating the processes by which subsidies are provided. The Guide is based on the main principles agreed on in the FAO Expert Consultation on Economic Incentives and Responsible Fisheries, held in Rome on 28 November ­ 1 December 20001. In early 2002, a preliminary draft Guide was prepared, based on available literature and information. This draft was then tested by the carrying out of prototype studies in four different countries after which it was revised, incorporating the experience from the test studies. The definitions and methodologies presented in the Guide have thus been developed by combining available theoretical knowledge with practical experience. A final draft version of the Guide was discussed in the FAO Expert Consultation on Identifying, Assessing and Reporting of Subsidies in the Fishing Industry in December 2002 before the present document was finalized2.
Scope of the Guide.
DEFINE: What is a fisheries subsidy?.
CLASSIFY: What different types of subsidies are there?.
ASSESS: What is the economic value of the subsidy?.
DESCRIBE: What information on subsidies is important?.
See FAO 2000a. See FAO 2002.
However, the subject of fisheries subsidies is vast and complex and the work carried out so far has not been sufficient for dealing with all aspects and issues that it includes. Therefore, this Guide should not be considered a final product but rather a flexible document that may need to be revised as more experience on how to study fisheries subsidies is acquired.
Chapter 2 How to use the guide.
Following the two introductory chapters, the Guide is organized in eight main chapters, each dealing with a separate aspect of a fisheries subsidies study: Chapter 3 Planning and preparing for a fisheries subsidies study Before starting the actual work on a fisheries subsidies study, there are several aspects to think about with regard to the objective, the scope and the resources needed. Chapter 4 What is a fisheries subsidy? This chapter discusses the definition of a fisheries subsidy. It emphasizes the importance of having a good understanding of both the fisheries sector and of the economy of which it is a part in order to be able to define subsidies. Chapter 5 Different categories of subsidies To facilitate the analysis of subsidies and to organize our information, it is suggested that fisheries subsidies are classified into four different categories. Chapter 6 Assessing subsidies This is the core of the Guide where the assessment of different types of subsidies is discussed. Principles and methodologies are suggested for how to measure the government cost ­ or revenue ­ and the value to the industry of fisheries subsidies. Chapter 7 Costs and earnings analysis ­ the impact on the industry In this chapter, a costs and earnings analysis is suggested for analysing the impact of subsidies on the profits of the industry in more detail. The classification of subsidies is expanded to include a dimension determining which type of costs or revenues that is being affected by a particular subsidy. Chapter 8 Comparative analysis Building on the results from the assessment of subsidies, this chapter suggests ways of examining the relative importance of fisheries subsidies. Chapter 9 What to include in a subsidy description In addition to assessing subsidies, such as estimating their economic value, there are other aspects that may be important to document and report on. A checklist for what to include in a description of a fisheries subsidy, based on the information required for the WTO subsidy notification procedures, is suggested.
Chapter 10 Reporting on subsidies In this last chapter, a few ideas are given with regard to how to structure the report on a fisheries subsidies study. A number of proposed international "conventions" regarding reporting practices are also presented. The user of the Guide should choose those parts of the document that are relevant for a particular study. Not all sections may be of interest to everyone. It is however recommended to read through the whole Guide to start with to gain a good understanding of the subject field and the issues at stake. Even though the Guide makes an effort to present the topics in the same order as they are likely to occur in the work on a fisheries study, there are several cross-cutting issues that are not possible to present in the assumed sequential order. It should also be recognized that the work is likely to be an iterative process that will take us backwards and forwards in the Guide several times. The index at the end of the document may be useful in this respect. To illustrate various approaches and methodologies, several examples have been included in the Guide ­ in particular on how to assess subsidies ­ and are presented in "boxes" throughout the text. These examples refer to an invented country called Seidisbus and are not real subsidies as such. However, the contents of the examples are in most cases derived from the experience of the four prototype studies carried out for the preparation of this document. Hence, it is believed that the examples cover some of the more important subsidies as well as the most common problems related to their assessment. At the same time, it should be pointed out that it has not been possible to include all aspects and types of subsidies in the document and the Guide does not lay claim on being exhaustive or fitting all situations equally well; omissions are inevitable. It is still hoped, though, that the guidelines will help identifying and assessing all types of fisheries subsidies, whether mentioned explicitly in the Guide or not. A bibliography is included at the end of the report and a glossary is found in Appendix I, giving explanations to some of the economic expressions and terms used in the Guide.
Chapter 3 Planning and preparing for a fisheries subsidies study.
As with all research projects and studies, there is a fair amount to do before the actual survey work can start. Planning for a study is an important process and the quality of the preparations can be essential for how good results we achieve. Hence, sufficient time and effort have to be allocated for the planning phase of the work. Some of the questions we need to answer before we start a fisheries subsidies study are: · What is the objective of the study, i.e. what questions is the study trying to answer? · What scope should the study have? Should it cover the whole of the fisheries sector or only selected subsectors or regions? Should it cover all subsidy types or only certain categories? · What are the resources available for the study? How much time do we have? · Who should carry out the study? What competences need to be represented on the study team? · What other preparations are needed with regard to background reading and development of methodologies? The clearer the objective of the study, the more focused the work can be and better results are likely to be achieved with fewer resources. If the study is carried out in a given context, maybe requested by a department or ministry with defined terms of reference, the objective is likely to be defined as well. However, if this is not the case and if it is the first time a review is to be carried out, we may want to keep the study quite broad, giving more of a general inventory of existing subsidies and related issues. A first subsidy study may have as an objective to identify issues to be studied further. The scope of the study is in some ways closely related to the next question in the list above, i.e. what resources are available. The more extensive the study, the more resources and time we will need. Time and resources needed will also depend on the general availability of data and the size and complexity of the fisheries sector. It is of course easier to carry out a fisheries subsidies study in a small country with a relatively limited fisheries sector for which there is already a good data collection system than in a big country with a very large ­ and maybe dynamic ­ fisheries industry for which data are generally not available with the central administration. Nonetheless, the minimum time required for a study also in a relatively "easy" country or region is probably at least three to six months if we want to cover the whole fisheries sector, i.e. all subsectors including input industry, capture fisheries, aquaculture, processing, and marketing and distribution. This time is likely to allow us to identify the main existing subsidies and to assess and give values to most of the more direct subsidies of Categories 1 and 2 (see chapter 5). Of course, the time required also depends on the number of people in our study team and on whether we work full-time on the study or not. However, even with a large team and full-time engagements, there are going to be delays in the data collection considering the large number of contacts that will be needed for a complete sector coverage. If we want to examine some of the more complicated subsidies in more detail, i.e. Categories 3 and 4 subsidies covering regulations and non-interventions (see chapter.
5), considerably more time will be needed. To examine issues such as free access to resources or the actual effects of gear regulations may require a focused effort. In fact, we may want to organize the study in a way that allows a separate study team to look into the details of specific issues. If only a limited number of these issues are being included and the special efforts organized at an early stage ­ to be carried out in parallel with other tasks ­ time can be saved. Nevertheless, it would be expected that a more detailed fisheries subsidies study would require at least six months to a year to complete, from the starting of the planning phase to the finalization of the report. In addition to ensuring that we have enough time, it is very important that our study team includes the right competences. With team members that are already familiar with the fisheries sector, the economic framework of the country or region, and with the concept of subsidies in general, the work on the study is likely to be easier. However, we should be more specific than that and, firstly, it would appear absolutely essential that at least one person ­ the team leader ­ has excellent analytical skills in addition to a general knowledge of the sector and the issues as well as the necessary time and interest for investing in the study. It is important to point out that the Guide is just that: a guide for facilitating the conduct of a fisheries subsidies study. It does not, however, give a complete set of "rules" to follow or set forms to fill in. It provides a basis for creating the tools needed to carry out a study and guidelines for the identification, classification, description and assessment of subsidies in a systematic way. Still, someone needs to develop these tools and analyse the results. Much of the work on assessing subsidies, in particular with regard to government costs, is based on information from the public accounts. Many of the calculations use accounting principles and standard methods for financial analysis. It would hence also appear important to have at least someone on the study team who is an accountant and who is familiar with the structure of the government accounting system. The team should also include an economist. Without these two disciplines, misunderstandings could occur and the results become unreliable. Likewise, access to information is fundamental for the study and this aspect also needs to be taken into consideration when appointing our study team members. With regard to other preparations before starting the actual survey, it is usually always a good idea to conduct general interviews with key informants and resource persons as well as to consult existing relevant documentation in order to establish a preliminary overview of the structure of the economy, the fisheries sector and existing subsidies. This preliminary investigation is particularly important for study team members who are not familiar with the subject area. Once we have a plan for what we would like to do, it is recommended that we put it down in writing. Clear terms of reference and a timeframe for the work, including milestones for the completion of various subcomponents, will help us to keep the right focus of the study and to monitor the work.

Chapter 4 What is a fisheries subsidy?.
4.1 A DEFINITION OF FISHERIES SUBSIDIES After having thought through the overall organization of the work and drawn up a general plan for the task ahead of us, the next thing we have to do when starting a fisheries subsidies study is to define what we mean by a fisheries subsidy. To most of us, a subsidy is some kind of government support to the private sector, generally serving a public purpose. Looking up the term "subsidy" in a dictionary gives us that a subsidy is "a direct or indirect payment, economic concession, or privilege granted by a government to private firms, households, or other governmental units in order to promote a public objective" (FAO Fisheries Glossary and Encyclopaedia Britannica 2001). Based on this general notion, the Guide proposes a broad definition of fisheries subsidies according to which a subsidy could fundamentally be any government intervention ­ or lack of intervention ­ that affects the fisheries industry and that has an economic value. This economic value is interpreted as something having an impact on the profits of the fisheries industry. The intra-government aspect from the definition above is disregarded and subsidies are defined as actions or inactions for which the recipient is part of the private fisheries industry (and not "other government units"). However, not everything the public sector does or does not do can be classified as subsidies3 and a further qualification of the definition is needed with regard to reference points. Accordingly, we define a subsidy as something that is out of the ordinary, i.e. something that is done differently from what is customary:.
Fisheries subsidies are government actions or inactions outside of normal practices that modify ­ by increasing or decreasing ­ the potential profits by the fisheries industry in the short-, medium- or long-term.
"Government" here also includes other governments and public bodies than the ones in the country where the subsidy as such exists. This would, for example, include contributions from public and international development aid and cooperation institutions. It also of course includes actions or inactions by non-fishery government agencies and organizations. If these actions or inactions benefit the fisheries industry in a significant way, they may be fisheries subsidies even if they are not only directed to the sector. Sponsorships by private companies do however not constitute subsidies. The "fisheries industry" refers to all productive subsectors of the fisheries and aquaculture sector, i.e. all types of input industry ­ including transport and other support services ­ capture fisheries, aquaculture, processing and marketing. It covers all producers and operators, both small and large-scale, engaged in recreational, subsistence and commercial activities. For our particular study, we may of course have.
For clarity, it should be mentioned that the Guide generally uses the term "subsidies", meaning ­ as defined above ­ all government actions and inactions. Occasionally, the term support measure or support program is used as a synonym to government action or intervention. With regard to government costs (revenues) for subsidies, expressions like public expenditures, expenses or costs, and public budget implications are sometimes used meaning the same thing unless stated otherwise.
BOX 1 WTO definition.
It should be noted that the definition of subsidies used in this Guide is much broader than the one used in the World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (SCM) which is perhaps the most commonly cited and practically applied subsidy definition. The SCM Agreement is WTO's basic subsidy agreement and the one that currently governs trade disputes regarding the fisheries sector in this respect. It specifies that a subsidy exists if "there is a financial contribution by a government or any public body within the territory of a Member" and this contribution fulfils certain specified conditions, or if "there is any form of income or price support in the sense of Article XVI of GATT 1994". Moreover, benefits have to be conferred. For the subsidy to be offending, it also has to be "specific", "prohibited" or "actionable" and cause "adverse effect" (WTO 1994 Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures, article 1, also described in Milazzo 1998). The Guide's definition does not require any of these conditions to be fulfilled; an action or inaction is considered a subsidy if it is outside of normal practices and it affects the profits of the fisheries industry. The Guide hence considers regulatory interventions such as border measures to be subsidies as well as interventions by third-country governments while the WTO does not. The Guide also take profit-decreasing subsidies into account, something the WTO ignores.
decided that we only want to look at a group of firm, at one or a few subsectors or at an aggregate industry level (see also chapter 3 and section 6.3). By "potential profits" the overall profitability of the industry is implied. However, while subsidies affect profits in the short, medium and long-term, the Guide's focus is on the more direct shorter-term financial effects as we will see when discussing how to assess subsidies in chapter.
It should be noted that subsidies could also decrease profits. Examples of profit-decreasing subsidies would be taxes and other fees and duties, levied by the government. It is important to note that the action (or inaction) does not have to be specifically directed to the fisheries industry ­ it can be something also applicable to other economic sectors ­ but if the fisheries industry benefits (or suffers) economically compared to industry in general, the Guide defines it as being a fisheries subsidy. 4.2 THE CONTEXT When we say that a fisheries subsidy is an action or inaction that is outside of normal practices, or non-customary, we need to know what we mean by "non-customary" in order to be able to distinguish between subsidies and normal ­ or general ­ actions and inactions. The best way to do this is to define what is general and use this situation as the benchmark for "normality" against which the government actions or inactions are measured, i.e. anything that is different from our normality reference point is noncustomary and hence a subsidy. It is conceivable that sometime in the future countries will agree on what is "normal" in a global context and therefore useful as international benchmarks and criteria for defining subsidies. Such benchmarks could inter alia include: interest rates for investment loans, standard fuel prices and minimum levels of cost recovery for fisheries management. However, because such standards do not exist presently and because it would take time to reach an agreement on them, it is suggested that standards represented by the overall economic framework of the particular country ­ or region ­ under study could be used. Accordingly, the reference points would refer to other sectors in the country, or group of countries, i.e. the "normal" situation without subsides is represented by the circumstances industry in general operates under in the.

Fisheries subsidies are actions or inactions by the public sector influencing the profits of the fisheries industry.
country or region and fisheries subsidies are defined and measured as deviations from these conditions. For example, in a country where public services are provided so to say free of user charge ­ because they are financed through the tax system ­ it would be considered normal that also the fisheries industry benefits from certain services without them being defined as subsidies. On the other hand, in a country where cost recovery is the norm, the same benefits to the fisheries sector are subsidies if not directly paid for by the industry. However, this approach would be unsatisfactory if we want to make comparisons between countries or regions. On some occasions, there may be alternative standards or guidelines that we can use. For example, if the results of the subsidy study are to be used in an investigation of the effects of subsidies on international trade in fish and fish products, we may want to adapt the definitions we use for our study according to those that are contained in the WTO Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (see also Box 1). If this is not the case, we could consider turning to economic theory for objective advice. This aspect is briefly discussed in Box 2 below. Another source of guidance is the arena of international
