<title>A Short Review of Precautionary Reference Points and Some Proposals or Their Use in Data-Poor Situations. A short review of precautionary reference points and some proposals for their </title>
<section>1</section>
Introduction
The last few years have seen a major proliferation of action on the formulation of reference points to achieve precautionary fishery management goals, following the technical Working Group of the Conference on Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks that met in 1994-95 (Annex 2 of that Report describes this requirement; UN 1995). This working group based its efforts on two FAO Fisheries Circulars: one on precaution, the other on reference points (FAO, 1995a,
b). The latter document, later revised and extended (Caddy and Mahon, 1995), put forward the concept of Limit Reference Points (LRPs) as one practical way of defining the limits to exploitation of a stock. Following this, recent work has distinguished Target Reference Points (TRPs) from Limit Reference Points (LRPs), but their relative role in the management process still remains somewhat unclear, and divergences of approach are evident, in which more than two types of reference points appear to be emerging.
What is most of concern with respect to the way the LRP concept has developed since the UN Conference and its base documents is that most current work on LRPs is aimed at the definition of reference points, with relatively less emphasis or experience on how efficiently they will perform in a functioning management system. As noted in an earlier communication (Caddy, 1997), this may require significant changes in the way that management bodies function but will also require a systems approach in which industry, managers and scientists discuss their respective roles, particularly in defining the risk to the resource of implementing a given management measure.
It may be worth recalling here that previous management approaches based on target reference points alone had proved vulnerable to overfishing once a TRP had been overshot. This was partly because of the high degree of uncertainty in locating the current position of the fishery in relation to the TRP but also because recovery times after effort overshoots were often long and because mechanisms for integrating the efforts of scientists, managers and fishermen into a single responsive fisheries management system had been neglected. Often adversarial positions were adopted in the course of management decision-making that required long negotiations and inconclusive management responses before the 'fishery system' could react to downturns in resource abundance due to fishing or natural causes. In the interim, the fishery continued to overfish the stock in absence of a prenegotiated, precautionary approach to management which is integral to the new legal instruments. We may expect
similar anomalies with the application of LRP-based management systems (Fig. 1), unless a systems approach is agreed to by all parties.
The new paradigm whereby LRPs are defined was incorporated into the UN Agreement and is also part of the FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries (FAO, 1995c). Integral to this LRP approach is the concept that the fishery as a 'system' will react to the approach of the fishery to an LRP by adopting a prenegotiated response to unfavourable events. This will necessarily involve sharp reductions in fishing effort over a period sufficiently sustained for the stock to return to a healthy condition, i.e. a stock recovery strategy will have to be applied to bring it back to a spawning biomass significantly higher than that at which the LRP is established.
Defining such a recovery target involves setting a distinct biomass-based management RP. This is defined by recent international instruments as that at which "the stock can support the harvesting of an MSY without adverse impacts". This is not to imply, of course, that the MSY conditions should be the target for harvesting; to the contrary, both the FAO Code of Conduct and the UN Agreement on Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks indicate that MSY conditions should be regarded as representing a limiting condition that should not be exceeded (for F[MSY]) or allowed to fall below (for B[MSY]), and MSY conditions now constitute minimum conditions for stock recovery.
Questions relating to the definition of RPs have been the source of major discussion in a number of fora, for two of which a summary of the current position is given here, mainly based on the reports of Serchuck et al. (1997) for NAFO and ICES (1998).

Some General Considerations
The concept of reference points might imply to those unfamiliar with the practicalities of assessment science that managers know exactly where the fishery is in relation to them, and whether they are in a 'safe' or 'unsafe' condition. This is of course not so, given coefficients of variation for most relevant variables even in well-documented fisheries of 10-30+% (Caddy and Mahon, 1995). What in effect will be required for 'precaution' is to translate reference points from deterministic values into likelihoods of the fishery finding itself in a more or less risk-prone zone (Fig 2). Before proceeding too far with refinements on RP estimation, it would be wise (Table 1) to carry out a broad review of the biological (and economic) literature in search of possible indices that could measure particularly sensitive aspects of the actual conservation situation of the resource in question (Caddy, 1998), and this has particular relevance for tunas.

A review of the biological basis for fisheries management would minimally cover:
· management procedures currently in place and their consequences
· scope of feasible management actions available for the fishery
· stock structure of the species involved
· main predator-prey relationships
· main environmental relationships as they affect recruitment and growth
· distribution of the stock with respect to the distribution of the fishery
· spawning areas
· juvenile areas and rearing areas
· migration patterns by size/age groups
· influence of density on growth and/or distribution
· variability in recruitment and its main causes
· stock-recruitment relationships
· fleet composition, the fisheries in which they are involved, their interactions and their selectivities
· robustness of various stock assessment approach (including statistical catch-at-age analysis)
· possibility of a catastrophe (e.g. what happened for these stocks in the past or for stocks with similar characteristics elsewhere).
Assessment working groups would normally either provide these reviews or be closely involved in them.

From Table 2 and Figures 3 and 4 some differences, but also many similarities, emerge between the approaches of ICES and NAFO: the first reflects the purely advisory role of ICES (no targets for fishing are suggested), while a slightly more precautionary approach is adopted by NAFO in which different 'zones' of the control law diagram (Fig. 4) correspond to different fishing strategies. Also, fishing below F[BUF] is prohibited by NAFO but not specified in the control law by ICES. A further note is that the F[TARGET] and B[TARGET] criteria of ICES are mainly intended for stock recovery strategies, although there is not a particularly clear distinction (at least to this author) between stock recovery strategies and what happens following effort cut-backs once an LRP has been infringed. Apart from these differences, we can say that, in practice, F[BUF] and F[PA] are LRPs but are also likely to be treated as targets if it is decided to exploit the stock to its maximum, so that,
for most purposes,
MAX (F[TARGET]) = F[BUF] (NAFO) = F[PA] (ICES)
The value of S in the above equations is left undefined, and the effects of different values are apparently established by simulating exploited life histories, suitable values chosen being such that, for example, there is a 50% chance of a stock recovering to MSY conditions in (e.g.) 10 years.
In elaboration of the original UN scheme which implied a single TRP/LRP pair, in the North Atlantic a second precautionary reference point, known as F[PA], (F precautionary) is incorporated. This is the upper limit for fishing mortality rate and is set significantly lower than the F-based LRP, with the intention that fishing effort be progressively reduced once this point is reached and biomass starts to decline (Figs 3 and 4). A comparable RP framed in terms of biomass is B[PA], which has the role of ensuring that the fishery stays in the zone above an LRP established in terms of spawning biomass.
Within NAFO, B[BUF] plays a comparable role as the 'first line of defense', being the biomass level that once dropped below triggers immediate action, in this case to slow exploitation, such that there is a low probability that B[LIM] will not be reached. Both 'PA' and 'BUF' suffixes distinguish not so much the way the reference point is calculated or defined but its role within a harvest control rule or law. As noted above, these levels of F and B can either be regarded as LRPs themselves in the sense used in FAO (1995b) or can be regarded as extreme values for TRPs.

Figure 4. 'Zoned' approach to a harvest control law (from NAFO reports).
One can deduce from the need to formulate 'BUF' and 'PA' RPs that the actual 'extreme-value' LRPs chosen by ICES and NAFO have been set at such a low, critical level of biomass that one would expect a serious threat of immediate stock collapse if they were attained or even approached. This would be the case for F[CRASH] For example, which is defined as the point at which yield declines to zero using age-structured data in the Shepherd production model (Shepherd, 1982; Fig. 5). One may question whether an alternative approach might be equally effective, namely establishing one set of LRPs at a higher level of stock size but allowing a slightly higher but controlled probability of overshoot. This was the possibility discussed by Caddy and McGarvey (1996), assuming only a single pair of TRP/LRPs.
Figure 5. Equilibrium yield as a function of fishing mortality determined from an age-structured production model (after Shepherd, 1982)
The NAFO approach to precautionary management can be summarized by the Control Law:
1. Ensure that: SSB > > B[BUF] > B[LIM]
2. Maintain: F[TARGET] < = F[BUF] < F[LIM]
(See Serchuck et al., 1997).
This scheme in effect shows the transition from a simple pair of LRP/TRPs towards a Harvest Control Law, but the approach still depends on effectively being able to judge where the fishery is in relation to a given RP.
The fact of suggesting an RP such as F[ComFIE(2)] which considers a 'basket' of LRPs, and responses to the first of these to be infringed, illustrates that, with current uncertainties, it might be better to not rely unduly on only one estimator if a real degree of precaution is required under uncertain conditions. This was also the motive for suggesting the 'traffic-light' approach described later in the document.
The comparable control law proposed by the ICES Comprehensive Fisheries Evaluation (ComFIE) Report (ComFIE, 1997) is given in three steps (Fig. 3), starting from low and moving to high levels of exploitation:
1. F = F[0.1]
for B > B[PA]
2. F = F[0.1]*(B-B[LIM])/(B[PA]-B[LIM])
for B[LIM] < B < = B[PA]
3. F - > 0
for B < B[LIM]
(Here B[LIM] is defined as 0.5 B[MSY] and B[PA] = B[MSY])

The Role of RPs and Harvest Laws in Management
One fundamental aspect here that is left out of much of the technical documentation on RPs is that in both the Code and UN Agreement, and also emphasized in the guidelines for applying the precautionary approach (FAO, 1995c), it is understood that reference points are only relevant if placed in their management context as part of a Fisheries Control Law that must include industry and management to be effective and must take into account risk at all levels of implementation of a Control Law (Table 3). This requires cooperation to include some or all of the following elements. Each partner in the management system needs to play a coordinated role, as illustrated in simplistic form by the following table.
Table 3. Relative roles of fishery scientists, managers and the fishing industry in management by Reference Point/Control Law
Scientists
Management
Industry
- Define options for safe targets for exploitation (TRPs) and how to measure them
- Estimate current size of stocks and reproductive potential
Consider how to monitor landings, expenditure of fishing effort, changes in fishing power and area/season of fishing
Provide information on landings, biological data and areas/times as condition of licensing
Define upper limits for harvest/exploitation rate/surviving biomass which ensures adequate spawning
Consider feasibility of reducing fishing effort drastically when stock is depleted; develop recovery plans
Negotiate with management on actions to be taken when stock reaches LRPs
Suggest options for decision rules within which LRPs and TRPs will play a key role
Agree on a decision rule and on TRPs and LRPs and consider their implications for MCS and for stock recovery strategies as needed
Negotiate with management on practicalities of the fishermen's response when key points in decision rule and LRPs are reached
It is clear that TRPs and LRPs alone do not lead to a responsible or precautionary management response, and Figure 1 illustrates that a high degree of rigour is appropriate in setting LRPs only if the management response is designed to be rapid and effective in controlling potential overfishing. Reference points can only be effective if appropriate management responses (and, by the same token, agreement with the fishing industry) are prenegotiated and effectively implemented. If this is not the case, what may be needed are a number of empirical, but easily understood, indicators of potentially dangerous conditions, which can be phrased as easily measured quantities, directly relevant to the fishery in question.
Relevant in this respect is that, within ICES, the precautionary basis for advice given to ACFM will be that, for a given stock, "the probability of exceeding the limit reference point will be no greater than 5% in any given year" (Serchuk et al., 1997). The implication of this, of course, given that current data from the fishery (e.g. catches, survey biomasses) have an intrinsic coefficient of variance probably of the order of 20-30%, is that, in order to rigorously avoid the zone close to the LRP, the TRP must be set at a low level, or one or more other controls must be in place to detect and respond to declines in stock levels even before the LRP is reached.
One issue that comes out of recent intensive studies by ICES, NAFO and other organizations is that the search for practical limit reference points has generated an unprecedented amount of new research on how to set the limits to exploitation. The danger, however, is that this search become disconnected from the management process as a whole and that the systems view of a fishery be lost. Views were even expressed in the relevant scientific reports that the precautionary approach is not a matter of concern to scientists but solely relevant to managers. Certainly, scientists cannot preempt the role of managers and should not bias their analyses in the search for results that are more 'safe' for the fishery as a whole. At the same time, the fishery is an objective system, and someone needs to consider its performance in toto, and this is a legitimate role for systems scientists in cooperation with the other players or stockholders. In doing this, it will also be necessary for
scientists to calculate the risks of the overall management system not meeting its goals, given a series of likely eventualities. Defining LRPs alone will not achieve this 'Systems Science Goal'.
With this in mind, it may be worth illustrating several alternative ways in which an LRP-based system might operate. Figures 3 and 4 show decision rules adopted by ICES and NAFO and Table 4 gives some of the reference points proposed for inclusion in these rules. One might suppose that following procedures similar to those proposed by the IWC in the late 1980s that, if the fishery and resource are well understood, such 'harvest- control laws' could be elaborated in even more detail, negotiated with industry and set to function largely independently of annual assessments in the form of 'fishery management procedures'. Such an approach has been described for South African fisheries (e.g. Butterworth et al., 1997); the 'traffic-light' approach described later offers a different approach to the same problem.

As noted, two categories of RPs are now defined: the reference point may refer to a feature of the underlying model providing it (e.g. F[MSY] F[0.1], F[CRASH]. etc.), which are referred to in Table 2 as 'technical' reference points, or the RP 'acronym' may simply refer to the role of the reference point in the decision rule adopted (e.g. F[PA], B[BUF], F[LIM]). These may be defined in terms of one or more of the above model-based RPs or be based on other empirical criteria that are of importance to the fishery in question.
What is clear from examination of recent ICES and NAFO reports is that almost all RPs currently in use are based in some way or other on the availability of age-structured data and on information on stock and recruitment accumulated over a significant period of time. Where production models are used offering estimates of MSY or F[CRASH], For ICES these are largely derived from the Shepherd (1982) model which creates a general production function from stock-recruit data.
This dependence on stock recruit information was the problem facing the NAFO meeting in March 1998 since for many NAFO stocks of fish or invertebrates age data and time series are not readily available. In a sense, then, these NAFO stocks (such as cephalopods and shrimp) face some of the same problems as most tuna fisheries and almost all developing country fisheries in defining precautionary reference points. For these, one may have to seek other less rigorous approaches to setting reference points. This is where it is again essential to consider how reference points are going to be used by managers and understood by fishermen. In other words, a highly technical RP or control law will be difficult to explain to industry and will still need to accumulate practical experience 'on the grounds', while a less precise or 'empirical' RP may be effective if it is understood and receives consensus from industry and still leads to reproducible results.
It is even possible that relatively arbitrary value(s) may be adopted for RPs which attempt to reproduce situations similar to those remembered by the industry in earlier favourable years in the fishery (e.g. B[1965] or B[1970], or values for RPs may be used that appear to be precautionary from experience in this fishery or elsewhere. In fact, it can be noted that the setting of 'pairs' of LRPs and TRPs using formulations such as [F[PA] = F[LIM].exp-2^S) in Table 2 is an arbitrary but necessary procedure; the 'distance' between the TRP and LRP depends on the value of S which so far has not usually been defined but is typically taken as 0.2-0.3 (ICES sources).
The point is that, however defined, RPs will need to be subject to some 'tuning' as part of a fishery management system and will probably have to be modified in light of practical experience. Relevant experience here was gained in South African fisheries, where, even though in an early version of a management system, a prenegotiated management response had been agreed to with industry, but experience soon led to its modification in the light of its application.
It is of particular interest to note that, where there is inadequate data for establishing a harvest control law, it may be still possible to set a single LRP that corresponds to serious but not catastrophic conditions and then pick a TRP based on estimates of variance and probability of overshoot. Such an approach was suggested by Caddy and McGarvey (1996) and may provide a useful tool for guessing a suitable value for a TRP, given a pre-established LRP. Although, as noted by Caddy and McGarvey (1996), the variance of fishing mortality is difficult to estimate, reasonable orders of magnitude can usually be guessed at by those familiar with a fishery. As an example, given a value of CV[F] = 0.25 and F[LIM] = 0.6, this provides a value for F[NOW] ^= F[PA] of the order of F = 0.4-0.43, with an acceptable probability of overshoot of 5%. A similar value could be derived from the Appendix and the table in Figure 6, from Caddy and McGarvey (1996). As noted, such an estimate
requires that the risk of overshoot of the LRP acceptable to managers be also specified, a factor which is not generally taken into account in most LRP-based systems.

Objectives Underlying Formulation of Management and Reference Points
Three major management strategies have been described (see Caddy and Mahon, 1996), namely management for a given level of quota, for a given exploitation rate or for a pre-agreed level of spawning escapement. These have more recently been combined with threshold or limit reference point policies (e.g. Quinn et al., 1990). Viewed from the perspective of precaution and the reference points involved, the first of these strategies implies of course quota control, and despite current perspective in many areas of its suitability as a limit reference point, MSY, or more precautionary 2/3 MSY, are RPs here.
The second strategy could, of course, be implemented in a straightforward fashion with control of fleet capacity and fishing power as its primary control variables, although, again, some secondary application of quotas to keep exploitation rates close to constant is usually the strategy adopted. The reference points F[0.1] (Gulland and Boerema, 1973) or, more cautiously, F[0.2] (Butterworth et al., 1997) are the classical target reference points that correspond to this strategy, with some common RPs, such as F[MAX], potentially providing an upper limit.
The third strategy is of course a biomass-based approach, with emphasis on maintenance of spawning potential and monitoring survival of recruits. Here, stock-recruit approaches originally applied for salmon stocks on the Pacific coast of North America have been applied in North-Atlantic areas to groundfish, using either the classical Beverton and Holt or Ricker S-R relationships to define RPs such as FLOSS (Table 4). Recently, the Shepherd production model, which is fitted to age structured data, is the model which is most commonly used and is employed to define truly catastrophic LRPs such as F[CRASH] (Fig. 5). Where age-structured time series are not available, SSB/R calculations yield LRPs such as F[%SPR] as described by Clark (1991).
Figure 7. Bootstrap estimates of the total mortality rate at MSY (Z[MSY]) in a logistic model expressed as cumulative values. Two percentiles, S[25] and Z[50], might be candidates for a TRP/LP pair (Caddy and Defeo, 1996)
<section>5</section>
A Brief Classification of LRPs and their Applicability in Information-limited Situations
Reference Points Based on S-R Relationships
For completeness, reference points based on availability of historical S-R data are included here and are obviously those which require the most complete data sets, consisting of time series of age-structured catches and population sizes, often supplemented by regular biomass surveys. As noted, such reference points form the main basis for LRP definition in the ICES and, to a lesser extent, NAFO areas. For example, F[MED] (Sissenwine and Shepherd, 1987) is the fishing pressure that reduces spawning biomass of a year class over its lifetime below the corresponding value for its parents and is estimated from the slope of the line through the origin of the S-R relationship for a fishery. Others are referred to more extensively in Mace (1988), Caddy and Mahon (1995), etc., and it remains to be seen whether these are likely to have wide application for data-poor fisheries, but a brief list of common approaches to LRP formulation follows.
Reference Points Based on Y/R and SSB/R Analysis
The classical TRP for Y/R analysis is of course F[MAX], which again, nowadays, tends to be regarded as an LRP, with F[0.1] commonly used as the corresponding TRP, both being subject to change as a result of changes in age distribution, recruitment and selectivity changes. Hence the need for the use of F[0.1 ]in conjunction with an LRP. In New Zealand, if an LRP cannot be estimated from a model, it is often substituted for by the relevant value of M (see later). In South Africa, F[0.2] is frequently used and is a more restrictive exploitation rate reference point, which has been used as a target or a benchmark in a fisheries management procedure (Butterworth et al., 1997).
Spawning stock biomass/recruit reference points include F[REP], F[HIGH] and F[LOW] and these may also be subject to variability for the same reason as mentioned for F[0.1] above (as, in fact, is true for most RPs). F[35%] or F[30%] are two fishing rates based on previous data sets for stock and recruitment that calculation has shown will maintain SSB/R at safe levels: the latter is an RP used by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council (Hollowed and Megrey, 1993), which is believed to be roughly equivalent to about 75% of long-term MSY as long as spawning stock size does not fall below 20-60% of the unfished level (i.e. both fishing mortality and biomass need to be monitored).
Reference Points Based on Production Modelling
The classical RP (now regarded in some quarters as an LRP) is of course F[MSY] In the past, MSY has been the classical management target, to be probably replaced now by quotas set at lower levels of harvest pressure, such as F[0.1] or that corresponding to 2/3 MSY, (Doubleday, 1976). Although, strictly speaking, it belongs in the previous category since in the ICES area it is usually estimated by the Shepherd approach, which depends on data for fitting S-R relationships, F[CRASH] In theory could be estimated by more conventional production modelling as the point of interception of the right-hand limb of the curve on the fishing effort axis. One may doubt whether this is a particularly safe LRP and certainly not one to be exceeded! More relevant here could be the economic benchmark referred to as the point of Bioeconomic Equilibrium, where costs equal revenues from fishing (e.g. Panayotou, 1988). This seems a logical LRP to use, especially in high-seas fisheries where costs
and revenues should be relatively easily measured.
Using size compositions to arrive at simple estimates of total annual mortality rate may allow application of production models using mortality in place of fishing effort (e.g. Caddy and Defeo, 1996). These authors show that, given reasonable time series of annual data for Z[t] and Y[t], it is possible to use bootstrapping to arrive at a series of estimates for a TRP such as MSY. Ranking separate estimates and plotting them cumulatively (Fig. 7), the 50% quartile of the cumulative distribution of MSY estimates might make a suitable LRP, while the 25% or more cautious percentile could be a candidate for a TRP.
Reference Points Based on Survey Data
The trend in many fisheries where commercial data is uncertain or unreliable is to rely to a progressive extent on estimates of biomass coming from surveys. While this does not seem a readily available option for most tuna fisheries, a study of a longline fishery for sablefish (Ruppert et al., 1985) suggests a general formula for using survey data in setting harvests under thresholds, namely
Catch in year t of age group a: C[at] = G[t]*(S[a]*N[at] - T)
where G[t] is some function of the exploitation fraction in year t, S[a] is selectivity at age, N[at] is the number of age group a in year t, and T is the threshold population size below which harvesting ceases. Some variation of this approach may p
