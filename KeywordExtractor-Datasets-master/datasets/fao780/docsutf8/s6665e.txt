<title>ADCP/REP/87/24 - Planning an Aquaculture Facility</title>
<section>1</section>
PREFACE
Modern aquaculture is an emerging technology, and each year scientists make technical advances in their disciplines which push husbandry and management of aquatic animals to new limits.
The continuous stream of new information requires flexibility in the engineering and operation of all facilities for the culture of aquatic animals to avoid immediate or future obsolescence. The planning and design of these facilities therefore require thoughtful integration of many technical skills in order to obtain the most economic return on capital investment.
This ADCP guideline document describes an INTEGRATED SYSTEMATIC APPROACH to the planning and design of aquaculture facilities. Among the list of typical facilities are fish and shellfish hatcheries, land-based farms, offshore farms and cage complexes, research laboratories, and training centres. Public aquariums, which are often associated with aquaculture facilities, can be included also. The integrated systematic approach simplifies and orders the planning and design process, and makes certain that the end-product is both technically and economically appropriate for the intended purpose.
The document is directed at Upper-level and Mid-level Management, specifically investors and managers of both public and private funds who often have little or no knowledge about aquaculture and the mechanics of designing and operating the special facilities which the aquaculture sector requires. This lack of information and guidance has had serious consequences in the past, and many poor investments have been made due to misplaced objectives, poorly designed buildings, non-functioning systems, construction delays, and cost over-runs. These have detracted from confidence in the industry.
The contents of the document are concerned particularly with the role of engineering and engineering services in the design and development process, as this role is not well-understood by non-professionals. The document is also sufficiently detailed to be useful to aquaculture biologists and technicians, who often try to fulfil this role themselves.
The document contains also Check Lists for assembling criteria about all aspects of the proposed facility, and some typical Terms of Reference for the engineer, architect, biologist and economist who nay be employed in the planning and design of aquaculture facilities.

1. INTRODUCTION
An INTEGRATED SYSTEMATIC APPROACH to the planning and design of aquaculture facilities establishes effective communication between the many professional and non-professional individuals who can be involved, such as:
(i) planners, administrators, and developers, who are concerned with investments which are economic and profitable in the use of all resources,
(ii) engineers and design specialists, who are concerned with the interpretation of biological and technical data into workable and reliable production systems, and
(iii) biologists and technicians, who are concerned with technological and environmental concepts and their constraints for the welfare of the captive aquatic animals and plants.
The systematic approach streamlines the planning and design process. It reduces the period of time between conceptualizing and commissioning of the completed facility, and invariably saves capital investment and effort. Often it makes the difference between economic success or failure of a project, irrespective of its purpose.
The systematic approach to project planning and design does not impose a set of rules which must be applied rigidly, regardless of relevance. Its purpose is to provide a framework within which:
(i) the important factors of the proposed project can be identified,
(ii) critical decisions can be identified and made, and
(iii) full account of the proposed operations can be agreed and communicated between participants.
The framework establishes an orderly progression of activities which will result in a clearly expressed and attainable objective, a functional design, and a well-managed and executed project.
At times the use of an organized systematic approach, with its associated costs in money and effort, may appear unnecessary and wasteful. - particularly if the facilities to be constructed are modest. However, the evidence is that the long-term benefits for any project are substantial, and are ultimately reflected in increased production, reduced operating costs, and overall efficiency. Well-documented and detailed planning and design guarantees that the original purpose of the project is:
(i) properly established and understood,
(ii) continuously carried out in the event of changes in the design or operating personnel, and
(iii) readily re-established even after a lengthy postponement.
The quality of the planning document desired, and the quantity and accuracy of the specified technical criteria, also benefit future projects. They provide continuity and set standards for the sector. Such aspects are of particular importance fox governments and organizations which finance aquaculture facilities in developing countries (such as the investment banks, multilateral and bilateral assistance agencies), as well as private investors.
One of the most difficult jobs in the planning and design process for an aquaculture facility is to quantify the biological criteria accurately. These data are necessary to convey to the design engineers the size, function, and integration of each individual component of the operation. Without all the necessary and accurate criteria (such as water quality requirements, flow rate, quantities of fish to be produced, feeding requirements, etc.), the tasks of identifying and evaluating potential design solutions are difficult.
At the present time, aquaculture development continues to be based on inexact science and technology. This has been one of the main reasons for many poorly designed facilities, and the high frequency of over-runs on project costs. However, there is considerable information about the behaviour and environmental requirements of captive aquatic animals and therefore ignorance of function cannot be part of the design process. This information has to be used to best advantage and will, in turn, identify uncertainties and risks. Given the availability of accurate data, appropriate planning and design range from simple mechanical solutions to sophisticated and complex technology, but, in the final analysis, it is function and economics which must dictate the choice.
All aquaculture projects originate with a concept, however imprecisely formed, and a set of simple objectives. For example, the concept may be the desire of an individual entrepreneur to invest in a hatchery and farm with an annual production of 500 tonnes of medium-size shrimp for export, or to develop 1000 hectares of low-lying land, or alternatively an international assistance agency may wish to finance a national aquaculture centre to accommodate 100 trainees. The planning and design process begins at this point and follows, step by step, well-established stages of development.
The process is based on:
(i) a clear statement of the concept and quantified objectives,
(ii) research of the biological criteria, and
(iii) a programme for carrying out exactly the operations required to achieve the objectives,
For most production facilities the main objective is a well-quantified production target of adults for market, or juveniles. Each biological-programme is therefore unique to each facility. While there may be common characteristics among a number of facilities, for example, in hatcheries for the production of post-larvae of many varieties of shrimp, every one is different in terms of its location, the species, the numbers to be produced, etc., as well as the individual manpower, company policies, and objectives governing its operation.
The planning and design process is divided into two principal phases. These consist of:
- Phase I. BIOPROGRAMMING,
- Phase II. DESIGN
A third phase, which occurs after the first two are complete and which is immediately necessary if the facility is to be constructed, is included for completeness but is not dealt with in this document in any detail.
- Phase III. IMPLEMENTATION.
The relationship of these three phases is illustrated in Figure 1, and they are described in detail on the following pages.

BIOPROGRAMMING identifies and assembles the main technical and biological criteria which are used to define the physical design of the facility. The output of this phase is the Bioprogramme, a document which contains statements of the concept and objectives, the design criteria, a biological and operational plan, and relevant schedules. It can also contain illustrations which enhance or clarify statements.
DESIGN defines and develops all structures, based on established criteria. The output of the design phase may be in two parts, namely:
(i) Preliminary design drawings, which (as they infer) can be reviewed and changed as necessary, and
(ii) Final design drawings and Construction documents, which cannot be changed (without considerable added cost) and on which are based the subsequent construction contracts.
IMPLEMENTATION organizes the optional services required during construction of the facilities and commissioning. The outputs of this phase are many, but are not dealt with in this document. For example, typical engineering outputs include a series of time and work plans, an administrative schedule controlling the quantity and delivery of materials, payment for work, testing and acceptance of completed works, a programme for commissioning, operational manuals, etc. There is often the requirement for biological outputs, including technical assistance, staffing, staff training. Operational manuals, etc.
Although the stages comprising each phase are sequential, they are not carried out in isolation. If new information becomes available during the design process, earlier stages may have to be reviewed to reflect it properly in the final design- By systematic planning, it is relatively simple to make such adjustments.
One important advantage of the phased progression is the refinement of the cost of construction. Design and cost data are more accurate as planning progresses (see Table 1), and therefore economic viability can be estimated and decisions evaluated if necessary before construction contracts are awarded. However, the cost of the planning and design process itself, while small by comparison with construction costs, is highest at this point. It is therefore important that any major changes are made as early as possible in the process, and each phase is appraised fully before continuing to the next.

The planning and design team should be made up of individuals well-informed and familiar with the many aquatic systems which exist. For the most part these are experienced biologists, engineers, and architects. Ideally, the owners and principal operators are also involved. Although a professional understanding of all disciplines is not required of each participant, the detail of the planning will be dictated by the level of experience available. The presence of local and national specialists in the team is important. Their participation will encourage a design well suited to the local environment, building materials, and construction techniques, as well as operating characteristics.
The actual composition of a team, and the individual relationships and responsibilities with the project, vary according to circumstances. Some typical Terms of Reference for the engineer, architect, biologist, (and possibly an economist) who may be used in the team are described in Appendix I.
Figure 2 illustrates typical levels of involvement of the team members, depending on the type of project.
At the simplest level, the process may be carried out by the owner or developer directly, but more commonly a small group is assembled made up of individuals with the major background disciplines. In some projects the experienced 'generalist', with an appreciation of the overall issues and their inter-relationships, can be used as a coordinator and might even handle some small projects alone. Such coordination is not necessarily a full-time activity. However, major decisions regarding evaluation and continuation should not be made by the coordinator alone.
The relationships between the different individuals involved in project planning and design depend on the way the process is to be managed. Figure 2 illustrates diagrammatically typical relationships, and some projects may be managed by a combination of more than one style. The importance is to ensure that the lines of communication and responsibility are defined.

It is difficult to provide a precise guide for the cost of the planning and design process as a percentage of construction cost. The developers should be prepared to pay from 5-15% of the capital cost of the facility for the services of planning and design. In general terms, the cost of planning and design will be in the upper range if:
- the project is technically complex,
- there are 'unknowns' in the criteria, which require compensation,
- the facility has several different functions,
- the project is unique and cannot use standard components and materials,
- there are administrative difficulties, and standards and codes to meet.
The proportionate cost can be increased beyond 15% by any number of implementation services, particularly construction supervision, and then technical supervision and training may be required which can be very costly.

2.8 Conclusion
The first phase of project development is bioprogramming. This involves basic project planning and assembly of the design criteria, and includes quantification of all project components which describe functions and operations. Bioprogramming can be simple or detailed, depending on the nature and purpose of the project. Although frequently overlooked, bioprogramming is the most vital phase. Thorough effort at this time makes all subsequent stages easier, and avoids future complications and disagreements.
The elements of bioprogramming include:
2.1 - Project goals and concepts,
2.2 - Biological design criteria,
2.3 - Facility characterization or programming,
2.4 - Siting,
2.5 - Schematic design,
2.6 - Financial analysis,
2.7 - Environmental analysis,
2.8 - Conclusion.
The conclusion, or end product, of the bioprogramming phase is a summary report or project notebook containing all project philosophy, background data, design criteria, site data, environmental data, and the operational programmes. It is the invaluable link between concept and reality. The bioprogramme report serves as the reference throughout the evolution and operation of the project, and will ensure continuity. It is therefore worthwhile to have the report properly assembled into a document, and reproduced with many copies.
2.1 Project goals and concepts
The first step in bioprogramming is developing a statement of project intent. The statement should be as clear and concise as possible, and serve as a record of both purpose and methodology. A list of components which are usually considered at this stage is provided in Appendix II.
2.2 Biological design criteria
Each species of aquatic animals and plants has basic environmental requirements which must be fulfilled in the design of any facility, together with those for the optimum conditions under which it can be cultured. The extent to which these criteria are identified and then satisfied by the design largely determines the success of the future operations. Therefore, careful research of facts and attention to detail are highly recommended. Typically, the biological design criteria should be developed on the basis of statistics from similar facilities, research experience, and trends in culture techniques.
A combination of literature reviews and first-hand observations should be included and used in compiling the data base. A number of resources exist which will help the background search and are included in the References (section 6).
The key biological design criteria which are considered at this stage are:
- Species description
- Behavioural characteristics
- Culture techniques
- Environmental requirements, density, water exchange, water quality
- Nutritional requirements
- Growth rates
- Mortality rate
- Diseases
Further description of the needs in each of these components is given in Appendix III.
2.3 Facility characterization or programming
2.3.1 Programming approach
2.3.2 Programming infrastructure
Facility characterization or programming is a dynamic process which integrates project goals, biological design criteria, and site (engineering) conditions into a functional physical and operational plan.
There may be a need for several reviews and evaluations during programming, depending upon the alternatives for site selection, the knowledge of site conditions, and financial constraints. However, by conforming to a systematic programming process, it is simple to modify both biological and facility programmes as more information becomes available. The ultimate goal is a physical and operational plan which meets project goals and is realistic in terms of biological, engineering, and financial constraints.
2.3.1 Programming approach
Programming is a valuable tool which can be used to calculate the physical requirements required to meet specific production objectives, or to determine the carrying capacity of an identified site (see Figure 3). For example, the first approach may be used by a government agency wishing to develop a regional, multi-species demonstration and training centre, the second may be used by a landowner trying to convert an existing area of agricultural land into fish production. With both approaches, the biological criteria particular to a species and culture system is the common denominator.
Figure 3 Approaches to Facility Programming
Based upon the production goals and biological criteria, a biological production schedule for the proposed facility can be developed. The production schedule outlines the inputs and outputs of the project with time. For most projects, the schedule should be developed for monthly intervals, as at most facilities significant changes can occur this frequently.
The information required by the production schedule includes (1) numerical populations of animals at all stages, (2) water requirements, and (3) space requirements.
Under Alternative I (Figure 3), the production schedule is developed by combining biological criteria and production goals. Figure 4 illustrates one useful format for presenting this information.

The schedule outlines the inputs and outputs of the project over an annual cycle, calculated at monthly intervals. If annual water temperatures are known for a site, they should be used as the basis of all calculations; if not known, then average temperatures within acceptable rearing ranges are used. For individual lots of fish to be produced (or received) at a facility, either different species or age groups, the numbers and dates should be projected; also the size (length and/or weight) of individuals at stocking. The total biomass can then be calculated. Changes in population, animal size, and biomass should be calculated monthly for each lot by applying the appropriate mortality and growth rate criteria. Once the desired size is reached, the population, in whole or in part, should be designated as harvested.
After making the production schedule, a facility programme is developed by using the relevant biocriteria again to determine the volumes of water and (container) space needed for each population each month. An example of a format for reporting this information is shown in Figure 5.

If these requirements exceed the capacities of the site, the process must be repeated until an appropriate balance is reached.
During facility programming it is important to note that it is often undesirable to handle the stock frequently. Thus additional space requirements are often required, especially during the early months of rearing. Similarly, water requirements should be calculated empirically as well as theoretically to accommodate the additional facilities.
In Alternative II (Figure 3), that is to make the programme fit a site, the procedure is performed in reverse order. The water and/or space data are entered first and the production potential calculated from them.
The procedure can be repeated for various combinations of fish populations, sites, and culture technique alternatives to provide an objective basis for evaluating the costs and benefits of each. The schedule may also have to be adjusted if information obtained during subsequent evaluations or design phases indicates an unsatisfactory financial analysis.
2.3.2 Programming infrastructure
The next step in the planning process is to develop programmes for infrastructure - including both the water system, and production and support spaces.
The volume of water required on a monthly basis should have been determined during the production scheduling process. It is now necessary to determine additional operating water requirements of the facility. At this stage, the system is not being engineered but rather characterized.
The factors which should be considered in preparing a written description of the water resources required are described in Appendix IV.
Depending upon the complexity of the proposed water system, it is often useful to prepare a process diagram to illustrate the complete system (see Figure 6).
Facility requirements for both production and support activities should be developed from the proposed production programme, and the operating criteria required. The criteria for the most significant infrastructure component, the production units themselves, must be specified by the system of culture to be used and the criteria which specify configuration and construction materials, etc. The remainder of the facilities are then developed from the operating goals and the availability of supporting infrastructure in the surrounding area.
Figure 7 is an example of a format for summarizing the major facility components, their specific functions, and their inter-relationships. As a supplement, individual format sheets should be prepared for building spaces requiring specialized facilities and unusual features. Figure 8 is an example of a useful Summary schedule.

2.4 Siting
Once the programme and the criteria are established for all the production facilities and the other related infrastructure, possible sites can be identified and evaluated.
In cases where the site has been predetermined (Alternative II), special attention must be given to assessing the economic viability of the project altogether, as there are obvious limits to production capacity and facilities imposed by site constraints.
In cases where no site has been predetermined, the need is to identify the location where most of the requirements (all the biological and physical factors) are optimized.
A list of field evaluations which should be considered for siting is given in Appendix V.
2.5 Schematic design
The schematic design is the first step in translating the criteria and site constraints into a workable design. Therefore it is often called the conceptual design stage. At this stage of the process, the objective is primarily to select concepts and identify and solve major design problems. It is basically a verification that there are no physical constraints which will prevent meeting the production goals and purposes of the project.
The schematic design stage identifies, assesses, and recommends design alternatives for meeting production goals. These alternatives should reflect the use of local construction techniques and materials where applicable.
The end products of the schematic design stage will be:
(i) a written report fully describing the facility design concept,
(ii) a site layout, showing location of all major components on the site, which reflects topography and operational relationships,
(iii) floor plans for all major support buildings,
(iv) a schematic diagram of the hydraulics of all the water requirements for each production unit and facility, with elevations, and
(v) a topographic survey.
Sketches, such as those shown in Figures 9 and 10, are often useful to include in the schematic design report to illustrate the recommended design concepts. The schematic design also requires a site topographical survey to ensure that locations and hydraulic systems are conceptually correct. The survey should be included with the report.
Finally, it is important to undertake and include in the schematic design report an estimate of the preliminary construction and operating costs, and the project construction schedule. However, it is accepted at this time that the construction cost estimates are only an order of accuracy (see Table 1).
Figure 9 Typical Sketch of Building Concept
Figure 10 Typical Sketch of Pond Concept
2.6 Financial analysis
Following preparation of the cost estimates, a preliminary financial analysis can be made to determine if there are financial constraints to proceeding with the project as it has been conceptualized.
The financial analysis must consider the objectives of the project, including cost/benefit requirements of the owner and financing organization.
If the project is commercial, then reference must be made back to the original market assessment and marketing strategy for the products. If a market assessment and marketing strategy have not been undertaken, then these must now be undertaken before further investment is made.
If the project is not commercial, for example, a government facility for production and research, then it is still necessary to refer to government goals and objectives, and the capital and operating budgets of the appropriate department committed to manage the project.
In developing a financially stable project, whether for the private or the public sector, it is usually prudent to consider developing the project in phases. This can reduce the initial investment risk, demonstrate feasibility of the project, and generate income to offset further capital investment and operating costs.
It is also useful at this time to consider development alternatives for raising investment capital or reducing risk. These may be 'turn-key' projects, designer equity participation, and other forms of joint venture. Financing alternatives may include capital debt, equity, government development grants, subsidized loans, international technical assistance, etc. Deferred interest loans are frequently available for the private sector for aquaculture projects.
In the event that phasing or financing does not result in a satisfactory financial analysis for the project, it is necessary to return to the programme and to modify production goals and requirements until the project is economically feasible. Alternatively, a decision can be made to proceed no further with the project.
However, if changes are made to the programme which prove to satisfy the financial analysis, and the project proceeds, then it is imperative that all the stages of Phase I - Bioprogramming are repeated, and that a new schematic design report is prepared which complies with the modified programme. This does not in fact take long as almost all of the basic work has been carried out. It is important, nonetheless, to do it in readiness for the architects and engineers to begin the design based on the modified programme, and not the original programme.
2.7 Environmental analysis
In the bioprogramming and conceptualizing of every project, consideration should be given to its relationship with the environment. This includes not only the influences of the environment on the project itself, but also positive and negative effects the project may have on the environment.
All aspects of environmental concern require thought and often particular investigation, and merit statements in the bioprogramming documentation. In some cases, the national laws and local regulations may require extensive research, particularly where a negative impact is possible. For example, projects which will be using non-native species or stocks, or alter large areas of wetland or coastal areas, are especially sensitive.
In order to minimize undesirable environmental impacts, or to comply with laws and regulations, it may be necessary to alter production goals, siting plans, or design concepts. If the programme has to be modified to comply with environmental requirements, then the process (as with the financial analysis indicated above) must be repeated.
2.8 Conclusion
At this point in project development it is advisable to secure financing for the site (if necessary) and construction. It is also important to obtain all necessary permits to ensure rapid construction and subsequent operations.
The project notebook, the result of all the bioprogramming and planning, becomes a useful document for securing financing. Presented to funding organizations, such as development banks and multilateral organizations, and to governmental agencies which have authority over development projects, the project notebook describes a properly evaluated and functional facility, with
