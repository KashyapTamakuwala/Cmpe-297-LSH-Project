<title>Asia-Pacific Forestry Sector Outlook Study: FAO Outlook Study on Wood Based Panels Production, Consumption and Trade in the Asia Pacific Region 1996 to 2010</title>
<section>1</section>
INFORMATION NOTE ON ASIA-PACIFIC FORESTRY SECTOR OUTLOOK STUDY
At its sixteenth session held in Yangon, Myanmar, in January 1996, the Asia-Pacific Forestry Commission, which has membership open to all governments in the Asia-Pacific region, decided to carry out an outlook study for forestry with horizon year 2010. The study is being coordinated by FAO through its regional office in Bangkok and its Headquarters in Rome, but is being implemented in close partnership with governments, many of which have nominated national focal points.
The scope of the study is to look at the main external and sectoral developments in policies, programmes and institutions that will affect the forestry sector and to assess from this the likely direction of its evolution and to present its likely situation in 2010. The study involves assessment of current status but also of trends from the past and the main forces which are shaping those trends and then builds on this to explore future prospects.
Working papers have been contributed or commissioned on a wide range of topics. They fall under the following categories: country profiles, selected in-depth country or sub-regional studies and thematic studies. Working papers are prepared by individual authors or groups of authors on their own professional responsibility; therefore, the opinions expressed in them do not necessarily reflect the views of their employers, the governments of the Asia-Pacific Forestry Commission or of the Food and Agriculture Organization. In preparing the substantive report to be presented at the next session of the Asia-Pacific Forestry Commission early in 1998, material from these working papers will be an important element but will be blended and interpreted alongside a lot of other material.
Working papers are being produced and issued as they arrive. Some effort at uniformity of presentation is being attempted but the contents are only minimally edited for style or clarity. FAO welcomes from readers any information which they feel would be useful to the study on the subject of any of the working papers or on any other subject that has importance for the Asia-Pacific forestry sector.

1. OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY
The FAO Forestry Sector Outlook Study of the Asia Pacific region represents the first unified look at the forestry sector, its status, trends and prospects, since the previous FAO outlook study for the region carried out in 1976.
Core elements of the study will include status, trends and future prospects scenarios on:
· forest resources and wood resources outside forests
· consumption and trade in industrial wood products and wood energy
· forest industries and non-wood products and services
· environment, protected areas and conservation
· implications for future industrial raw material supplies
· sustainability dimensions of forestry development
· implications for policy, institutions and action, including investment
The wood based panel study is one of the key core components of the complete Outlook Study, and is the subject of this report, in which we have attempted:
· to measure the status and trends in the production, consumption and trade of wood based panels in the Asia Pacific region over the period 1990 to 1995.
· to describe the main determining factors driving the consumption and trade in wood based panel products within the Asia Pacific region.
· to study the continued availability of raw materials for wood based panels within the region, including large and small diameter roundwood, forest and mill residues, and residues from plantations and agricultural plants.
· To suggest various scenarios for the future growth in consumption and trade in wood based panels within the region up to the year 2010.

2. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
2.1. Current Consumption Patterns
2.2. Future Consumption Projections
2.1. Current Consumption Patterns
The economies of the major Asia Pacific countries (with the exception of Japan) have been growing at between 5% and 10% per year for about the past ten years, and this has been clearly reflected in the regional wood based panel consumption which grew at over 10% per year between 1990 and 1995, from 27.3 million m³ to 44.4 million m³ per year.
The pattern of growth by country was not consistent however and included zero consumption growth performances from Singapore, the countries of Indo China, Fiji and Papua New Guinea, and a growth rate of only 2% per year in Japan, the major wood based panel importer in the region. To offset these, the consumption in China grew by about 20% per year throughout the period, and Taiwan Province of China, India, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines all registered consumption growth rates of 10% to over 12% per year.
The pattern of growth between the various panels was also very variable with medium density fibreboard (MDF) being the star performer with an overall growth rate of 30% per year between 1990 and 1995, the highest sub-regional growth rate being in South East Asia at 40% per year, followed by North Asia at 30% per year, Oceania at 20% per year and South Asia at 16% per year.
The Particleboard consumption growth rate at 15% per year was also well above average, with South East Asian countries recording a growth rate of 25% per year, followed by South Asia at 20% per year, North Asia at 15% per year and virtually zero growth in Oceania.
The Plywood and Veneer growth rate for the region was only 8% per year between 1990 and 1995, but this figure masks the extreme variations of a 20% growth rate in China, a zero growth rate in Japan, and a negative recorded growth in Taiwan Province of China and South Asia.
The growth rate for other fibreboards (hardboard and softboard) was only 4.4% per year over the region, but these products are only consumed in fewer than half the countries of the region and, apart from China and Japan, the volumes consumed are very small.
Other products such as Oriented Strand Board (OSB) and Laminated Veneer Lumber (LVL) are relatively new to the region and consumption is confined mainly to Japan and other North Asian countries.
2.2. Future Consumption Projections
The most probable growth scenario for the Asia Pacific from 1995 to 2010 is probably conservative, showing total wood based panel consumption increasing from 44.4 million m³^ to 96.4 million m³ per year by 2010, which represents an average regional growth rate of 5.3% per year, down by half from the 10% growth rate achieved between 1990 and 1995. The variations within this scenario range from China, with an initial growth rate of 7.5% per year to 2000, falling to 6% per year to 2010; South East Asia and South Asia with an initial growth rate of 7% per year to 2000, falling to 6% per year to 2010, Oceania with a steady growth rate of 4% per year and Japan with a stable growth rate of 3.5% per year to 2010.
The optimistic growth scenario assumes that the region overcomes its current crop of political and financial problems and instabilities, and projects that wood based panel consumption could increase to 117.5 million m³ by 2010, which represents an average growth rate of 7.7% per year throughout the region, down slightly from the 10% growth achieved between 1990 and 1995. This forecast is closer to the expected levels of economic growth in the major countries of the region, and is a distinct possibility, but there are strong negative influences to be overcome first, if this scenario is to be realised.
The pessimistic scenario is unashamedly gloomy and projects a wood based panel consumption level of only 78.8 million m³ in 2010, representing an average regional growth rate of only 4% per year, which is a major drop from the 10% growth rate achieved between 1990 and 1995. The scenario is not impossible however, if the financial sector failures occurring or looming in Japan, Republic of Korea and Thailand are not stopped and the economies turned around. China too has problems to face with the overhaul of its ponderous, loss-making state sector enterprises, which could cause grave economic and political problems.
The most probable scenario for the period from 1995 to 2010 has been analysed in more detail between the types of panels. MDF growth rates are projected to continue at 12.5% till 2000 and to decline to 7.5% per year by 2010. Particleboard growth rates are also projected to decline and to level out at around 6.8% per year by the end of the period. Plywood growth rates are expected to decline to 3.2% per year by 2010. Other fibreboard consumption is expected to decline to a growth rate of 2.6% per year by 2010.
The economic growth and political stability of North Asian countries are the real key to the scenario which will be finally taking place, as the six countries of the sub region account for around 80% of the total wood based panel consumption of the region and 90% of the imports (mainly from South East Asia).

3. CURRENT SITUATION IN THE ASIA PACIFIC REGION 1990-1995
3.1. Market Overview
3.2. Plywood and Veneer
3.3. Particleboard
3.4. Medium Density Fibreboard (MDF)
3.5. Oriented Strand Board (OSB)
3.6. Hard and Soft Fibreboard
3.7. Laminated Veneer Lumber (LVL)
3.8. Other Panel Products
3.1. Market Overview
The wood based panel market in the Asia Pacific region has grown dramatically over the last ten years and, between 1990 and 1995, both production and consumption of wood based panels grew at over 10% per annum, when the comparative growth rates in the rest of the world were either between 2.0% and 2.5% or, in the case of Africa and the countries of the former USSR, growth rates were negative.
However the Asia Pacific region contains nearly two thirds of the world's population and there were many different economic performances and growth rates within the region over the period 1990 to 1995. Japan's economy was very quiet throughout the period and wood based panel consumption grew at only 2.0% per year. China's economy, on the other hand was booming and the consumption of wood based panels grew by 20% per year throughout the period.
Wood based panel consumption in the South East Asian countries grew at over 20% per year during the period, and this was matched by a period of frantic activity in the creation of new productive capacity, which is continuing into the next five year period. South Asian countries also registered a healthy growth level of 9.0% per year in panel consumption, New Zealand consumption grew by 10% per year and Australia by 5.5% per year over the period.
There were major differences between the demand for different wood based panels however, with a marked slowdown in the demand for plywood and veneer, which grew at only 3% per year outside China, where demand growth appears to have been 20% per year.
Particleboard demand averaged 15% per year throughout the region, with demand in China reaching 22% per year; demand in Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and India increasing by between 20% and 30% per year; demand in Republic of Korea increasing by 12.5% per year and demand in Japan increasing at only 7% per year.
Medium density fibreboard (MDF) was the star growth performer however with an average growth rate of 30% per year throughout the region between 1990 and 1995. The consumption of MDF in China grew by an overall 700% in the period; consumption in South East Asia grew by 40% per year; in North Asia consumption grew by 30% per year; in Oceania it grew by 20% per year and in South Asia it grew by 16% per year.
Demand for other forms of fibreboard grew by around 5% per year in China (which accounted for roughly 50% of the total demand), and by about 4% in the rest of the Asia Pacific region.
Oriented Strand Board (OSB) and Laminated Veneer Lumber (LVL) were new products introduced to the Asia Pacific region during the 1990 to 1995 period, and they have made comparatively small inroads into the structural board market to date.
3.2. Plywood and Veneer
The Plywood and Veneer market remains the dominant feature of the Asia Pacific wood based panel scene, in both volume and value terms. Plywood and Veneer Imports by the six major importers listed in Table A.3., accounted for 11.1 million m³ in 1995, or 78% of the total panel imports of 14.2 million m³. Plywood and Veneer exports by Indonesia and Malaysia alone, out of the six major exporters, accounted for 12.5 million m³ in 1995, or 82% of the total panel exports of 15.2 million m³.
Tables 1 to 25 of the main tables annexed to this report give a detailed picture of the production, imports and exports of all wood based panels, for all the major countries of the Asia Pacific region over the period 1990 to 1995.
In China (Table 1), the enormous apparent increase in the plywood production figures from 1994 to 1995, from 2.6 to 7.6 million m³, was due to the inclusion (by the Chinese Academy of Forestry), from 1995, of all production data from plywood mills outside the state sector. Previous production data was obviously heavily understated, but no exact figures are currently available. The 1995 figures show a plywood and veneer consumption level of 9.94 million m³, of which 24% was imported.
The Japanese plywood & veneer figures (in Table 2), portray a picture of steadily declining plywood production over the period 1990 to 1995, with increasing plywood imports and a relatively static or gently declining total consumption level. This was due partly to the very low levels of economic growth during the period, and partly to the substitution of certain plywood applications by other wood based panels (particularly thin MDF and a small but growing interest in OSB).
Other major plywood markets in the region (such as Republic of Korea and Taiwan Province of China), show a similar pattern to that of Japan, with declining local production being replaced by increasing imports, with either little growth or an actual decline in plywood & veneer consumption over the period.
Indonesia (Table 7) remains the dominant producer of plywood in the region, but with an almost stagnant regional demand level, the Indonesian production levels have been stuck at around 10 million m³ per year since 1991, and export levels have stayed at around 8.6 to 8.9 million m³ per year over the same period.
Malaysia (Table 8) has increased its plywood & veneer production from 1.8 million m³ in 1990 to 4.5 million m³ in 1995, a remarkable expansion rate of over 20% per year. Exports have similarly expanded from 1.4 million m³ in 1990 to 3.7 million m³ in 1995, a growth rate of almost 25% per year. Due partly to a stagnant or declining market in North Asia, and partly to the declining availability of peeler logs, this expansion is unlikely to continue.
Australian production of plywood & veneer increased a little from 125,000 m³ to 145,000 m³ over the period, with 31,000 m³ to 37,000 m³ imports and virtually no exports. New Zealand plywood & veneer production rose from 150,000 m³ in 1990 to 380,000 m³^ in 1995, with plywood exports increasing from 20,000 m³ to 68,000 m³.
Indian production of plywood remained steady at about 360,000 m³ during the period, with exports rising from 9,000 m³ to 38,000 m³ by 1995, leaving about 90% of the plywood for domestic consumption. Pakistan had a small production of about 15,000 m³ per year, all for domestic use.
A noticeable trend in the region's Northern markets is in the increasing use of imported softwood plywood (from New Zealand, North America and Europe), and a steadily increasing interest in OSB as a possible substitute for some plywood applications, particularly in Japan, Republic of Korea, Taiwan Province of China and Singapore.
3.3. Particleboard
Particleboard consumption in the Asia Pacific region expanded from 4.9 million m³ in 1990 to 9.9 million m³ in 1995, a growth rate of 15% per year. The production of particleboard in the region grew from a level of 4.2 million m³ in 1990 to 9.6 million m³ in 1995, a very healthy growth rate of 18% per year, but not quite enough to catch up with the growth of demand. The apparent regional deficit shrank from 700,000 m³ in 1990 to 300,000 m³ in 1995, and with a probable installed capacity of 11.75 million m³ by 1998, the deficit could disappear shortly.
China (Table 1) is the largest particleboard producer and consumer in the Asia Pacific region, with production levels which have increased from a probable 1.5 million m³ in 1990 to 4.4 million m³ in 1995. A high proportion of this production capacity (possibly as much as 50%) comes from several hundred very small locally made plants with capacity ratings of 3,000 to 5,000 m³ per year, producing boards of very variable quality from local wood waste or agricultural residues. The import levels of particleboard are very small as a percentage of consumption (about 1.25%).
Japan (Table 2) has expanded its particleboard production from 1.0 million m³ in 1990 to 1.25 million m³ in 1995, and the particleboard consumption has increased from 1.17 million m³ in 1990 to 1.65 million m³ in 1995, a growth rate of 7% per year which is three times the growth rate of Japan's consumption of wood based panels in general.
Republic of Korea's domestic production of particleboard expanded at more than 25% per year between 1990 and 1995, from 165,000 m³ to 548,000 m³ per year. Imports also increased and total consumption of particleboard rose from 557,000 m³ in 1990 to 1.0 million m³ in 1995, a growth rate of 12.5% per year.
Taiwan Province of China's particleboard consumption was small by comparison and rose to 300,000 m³ by 1995. China's Hong Kong SAR and Singapore were small importers and exporters of particleboard, with even smaller domestic consumption.
Indonesia increased its particleboard production from 310,000 m³ to 850,000 m³ over the same period, and exports rose from 103,000 m³ to 300,000 m³. Domestic consumption therefore increased from 207,000 m³ in 1990 to 550,000 m³ in 1995, a growth rate of about 22% per year. Though Malaysia's particleboard production increased from 90,000 m³ in 1990 to 400,000 m³ in 1995, exports also rose from 41,000 m³ to 250,000 m³ over the period, with a net increase in domestic consumption from 49,000 m³ to 150,000 m³.
Thailand's production of particleboard rose from 60,000 m³ to 550,000 m³, and exports went from zero to 222,000 m³ over the period. This resulted in net domestic consumption increasing from 60,000 m³ to 328,000 m³. The Philippines consumption level of particleboard also rose from 6,000 m³ in 1990 to 70,000 m³ in 1995.
Australia's particleboard production increased from 723,000 m³ to 864,000 m³ between 1990 and 1995, most of which (92 to 96%) was for domestic consumption. New Zealand production, by comparison, stayed around 170,000 m³ for the whole period, with exports increasing from 35% to 72% of total production.
India's particleboard production and consumption increased fourfold from 100,000 m³ in 1990 to 400,000 m³ in 1995. Pakistan production and consumption stagnated at around 54,000 m³ to 57,000 m³ per year.
3.4. Medium Density Fibreboard (MDF)
Total consumption of MDF in the Asia Pacific region rose from 1.1 million m³ to 3.7 million m³ between 1990 and 1998, a heady growth rate of 28% per year. The production levels in the region rose almost as fast, from 1.1 million m³ in 1990 to 3.4 million m³ in 1995, a growth rate of about 26% per year.
Production of MDF in China apparently rose from 87,000 m³ in 1990 to 589,000 m³ in 1995, though the 1990 figure has not been adjusted for possible non-state sector production. The relatively small levels of imports and exports indicate that China appears to have a small residual demand deficit in MDF, but this appears to be growing larger each year, as the economy expands.
Japan's production of MDF increased from 256,000 m³ to 400,000 m³ over the period, but imports increased even faster, from 87,000 m³ to 500,000 m³ between 1990 and 1995. The apparent consumption levels therefore rose from 343,000 m³ to 900,000 m³ over the period, a net growth rate of about 21% per year. Though exact data is not available, a large part of this remarkable increase was due to product substitution, by thin MDF replacing thin plywood in many furniture and joinery applications.
Production of MDF in Republic of Korea also increased rapidly, from 158,000 m³ in 1990 to 590,000 m³ in 1995. Imports increased up to 1994 but then dropped back to 1990 levels, leaving a net increase in consumption levels from 254,000 m³ in 1990 to 655,000 m³ in 1995, a growth rate of about 20% per year.
Taiwan Province of China has no MDF production capacity, but imports rose from zero to 376,000 m³ by 1995. China's Hong Kong SAR and Singapore were once again playing the roles of both importer and exporter, with small levels of domestic consumption.
Indonesia started the period with zero MDF capacity, but by 1995 had a production level of 100,000 m³ and a much bigger capacity in the pipeline. Malaysia's production of MDF rose from 50,000 m³ in 1990 to 350,000 m³ in 1995, and with some 250,000 m³ exported, domestic consumption has risen from 50,000 m³ to 100,000 m³.
Thailand also had zero capacity in 1990, but increasing to 300,000 m³ by 1995, with 117,000 m³ exported, and 183,000 m³ consumed domestically. Neither Philippines or Singapore have any production capacity but both countries import small quantities.
Australia increased its MDF production fourfold over the period, from 108,000 m³ in 1990 to 436,000 m³ in 1995. Australia is also an active importer and exporter of MDF, and its domestic consumption increased from 154,000 m³ in 1990 to 510,000 m³ by 1995, representing a growth rate of nearly 28% per year over the period.
New Zealand was one of the earliest producers of MDF in the Asia Pacific region, and increased production from 374,000 m³ to 583,000 m³ between 1990 and 1995. The majority of its production of MDF is still exported, but domestic consumption increased from 109,000 m³ in 1990 to 260,000 m³ in 1995, which is a growth rate of almost 20% per year. India and Pakistan both produce small quantities of MDF for their own consumption.
3.5. Oriented Strand Board (OSB)
Though this product is a major member of the wood based panel family in North America, and has a growing presence in Europe, it is currently very little used in the Asia Pacific region. There is a small pilot plant in China but it is being used for standard particleboard at present, and though there are other plants reported to be in the pipeline in China, Indonesia and Thailand, none of them appear to be confirmed projects.
In North America, OSB is a serious competitor for many traditional plywood applications, and has captured a large proportion of the structural panel market, particularly in housing applications. Because it does not need large diameter roundwood as a raw material, and its production costs are very much lower than plywood, the product should have a strong market potential in North Asia, particularly in Japan and China, which are major per capita consumers of plywood. In 1995 Japan imported about 260,000 m³ of OSB and has also imported a large number of prefabricated housing elements containing OSB panels. Small quantities have also been imported by China, Republic of Korea, Taiwan Province of China and Singapore, mostly on a trial basis.
3.6. Hard and Soft Fibreboard
Though hardboard and soft insulation board are produced in very few countries in the Asia Pacific region, and many of their traditional uses are being taken by thin MDF and other panels, the products continue to survive in certain traditional markets such as China, Japan and India. Total consumption in the Asia Pacific increased from 2.2 million m³ in 1990 to 2.7 million m³ in 1995, a growth rate of about 4% per year.
China has both the largest production capacity and the largest demand for these products in the region, and its consumption increased from 1,041,000 m³ in 1990 to 1,307,000 m³ in 1995, a growth rate of nearly 5% per year, and a total representing almost 50% of the regional consumption levels.
Japan is the second largest market and the second largest producer, particularly of the soft insulation board variety. The production levels of hardboard dropped slightly over the period, but production of softboard increased, and the combined Japanese consumption of these products increased from 633,000 m³ in 1990 to 741,000 m³ in 1995, which is a growth rate of 3% per year, roughly in line with the economic growth rate.
Republic of Korea produced 160,000 m³ in 1992, but production (and consumption) have dropped back to 24,000 m³ in 1995. Taiwan Province of China and China, Hong Kong SAR import small quantities, though the volumes appear to be declining. Indonesia produces and consumes small quantities, and Malaysia imports a little. Both Thailand and the Philippines produce and consume small quantities, and Thailand is also a net exporter of hardboard.
Australia and New Zealand produce and consume nearly 200,000 m³ of hardboard and softboard between them, but the volumes are not increasing and are not seriously imported or exported. India and Pakistan produce and consume small quantities.
3.7. Laminated Veneer Lumber (LVL)
LVL is a sub-classification of plywood, in which peeled veneers are laid up with the grain always parallel to the length, bonded with phenolic resin, into discreet panel sizes or into long structural beams up to 25 or 30 metres in length.
The total production of LVL in the Asia Pacific region in 1995 was 588,000 m³, with over 70% of the capacity being in Indonesia, mainly destined for export. Japan was the major consumer of LVL in the region in 1995, with a total consumption of 238,000 m³.
3.8. Other Panel Products
Cement Bonded Particleboard (CBPB) is a panel manufactured from cement and wood chips or flakes, and the pressing or setting process produces a useful building material for housing applications which is strong, easily worked and is both fire and moisture resistant.
Japan is the main producer and consumer of CBPB in the Asia Pacific region, with a capacity around 500,000 m³ per year. China, Malaysia, Thailand and Philippines all have a small production capacity of CBPB, some of which is exported to Japan.
Gypsum Fibreboard (GFB) is a panel made from gypsum and reconstituted fibre or paper waste. The product is a low cost, fireproof building panel. There are currently three small GFB mills in China and one in Thailand.
Triboard is a composite structural panel produced at a mill in New Zealand, predominately for the Japanese market. It consists of a thick, high density fibreboard core with two facing veneers.

4. THE MAIN DETERMINANTS OF CONSUMPTION AND TRADE
4.1. The effect of economic growth
4.2. The importance of external trade
4.3. The growth in construction activity
4.4. Development of the furniture industry
4.5. Substitution within wood based panel categories
4.1. The effect of economic growth
The primary driving force on the wood based panel market in the Asia Pacific region has been the extraordinary and sustained economic growth rates achieved in most countries of the region over the last ten to fifteen years.
The very close relationship between the growth rate of real GDP and the growth rate of wood based panel consumption in every region of the world, is clearly illustrated in Table A.1 below.

The average growth rate of real GDP in the Asia Pacific region between 1988 and 1995 was 8.0% per year, compared to a World average of 3.0% per year and an Industrialised country average of around 2% per year. Excluding Japan, the Asian GDP growth rate of 15.8% was in stark contrast to the rest of the world, which had growth rates somewhere between 2.2% and 2.5% per year.
The relationship between GDP growth and the growth rate in wood based panel consumption is also very clear, and the contrast between Asia (excluding Japan) and the rest of the world is equally stark. The Rest of Asia wood based panel consumption rate grew by 16.4% per year compared to only 2.0% per year for Japan, 1.6% per year for North and South America, 3.5% per year for Europe and a 1% per year decline in Africa.
A more detailed analysis of the growth in wood based panel consumption in the Asia Pacific region is given in Table A.2 below. It illustrates clearly the dominant role played by the rapidly expanding economies of China and the South East Asian countries, where the consumption growth rates were 20% and 21%, per year respectively.

Table A.2 also shows that wood based panel consumption growth rates in South Asia (the Indian subcontinent), in the rest of North Asia, and in Oceania, at 9.0%, 7.5% and 6.8% per year respectively, were also well above the average growth rates for the rest of the world.
In Asia, Japan was the notable exception to the general growth pattern, with a typical 'industrialised country' consumption growth level of just 2.0% per year. Excluding Japan, the wood based panel consumption in the rest of Asia grew at an average of 16% per year from 1990 to 1995, roughly doubling total consumption levels from 13.2 million m³ to 28.3 million m³.
4.2. The importance of external trade
In general, the major countries engaged in wood based panel trade are either timber deficient (and thus in need of imports), or rich in timber resources (and thus wishing to capitalise on the situation by developing exports). In Tables 57 and, the production, consumption and trade in wood based panels in the six major importing countries and the six major exporting countries in the Asia Pacific region, has been analysed in detail.
The selection of six major importing countries and six major exporting countries from over thirty countries within the region was not an arbitrary decision. The countries selected are the major economies of the region, and are thus the major players in the production, consumption and trade in wood based panels. Table A.3 below is a shortened summary of the detailed data from Tables 57 and 58, and clearly show that the twelve countries selected accounted for 97.3% of the wood based panel consumption in the Asia Pacific region in 1995, and virtually 100% of the import and export trade.

TOTALS
Within the above groupings of six Importers and six Exporters, there are countries such as China, Hong Kong SAR, Singapore, Philippines and Australia who could be in either group, as they play roles as both exporters and importers, so the selection is somewhat arbitrary. There are also major variations in relative performance, such as Indonesia and Malaysia who dominate the export league with over 90% of total exports within the region, or Japan, China and Republic of Korea who account for 77% of all imports
