Foreword
Historically, central government forest policies have failed to adequately recognize or value the contributions that forests make to subsistence economies and to income generation in rural communities. In the past two decades, however, awareness of these benefits has increased significantly, stimulating healthy debate over new forest policies that could potentially devolve more forest management responsibilities to forest-dependent people. The debate has been accompanied by policy experiments and institutional changes and, where indigenous and traditional forest management systems are recognized, control of forests is slowly being handed over to local people.
The shift from state controlled or conventional forest management to participatory forest management is still considered radical in many places, however. Consequently, progress toward state-community partnerships in protecting, managing and sharing the benefits of local forest resources is slow in most countries as stakeholders adjust to new arrangements and situations. The new approaches sometimes have had unexpected and profound implications for rural people. Women, in particular, have been affected in significant ways-sometimes positively, sometimes negatively.
This publication explores the consequences of Joint Forest Management for women in tribal communities in the Indian State of Andhra Pradesh. It reveals that women spend a greater proportion of their time collecting and processing non-wood forest products than men. Because of their greater contribution to the welfare of the household, women in tribal households have more decision-making power than those in many other Indian households. New forest management approaches must therefore recognize these distinct roles of women in household activities and decision making.
This publication's most significant contribution is in reminding us that even well-intentioned community management strategies may have significant negative impacts on women when gender dimensions of forest use and management are overlooked or downplayed. In contrast, gender sensitive development strategies benefit not only women, but the general household welfare. If developed appropriately, such strategies also can help prevent further forest degradation and deforestation. The experiences of Andhra Pradesh highlighted in this publication hopefully will provide valuable insights for development initiatives in other areas.

Introduction
Introduction
It is estimated that there are 66.5 million tribals in India (Maheshwari, 1990). With few exceptions, the majority of the tribals are forest dwellers. In spite of many competing demands and pressures on forests, tribals continue to depend on forests for their livelihood. Historically, in India, tribal perspectives on forests and government policies affecting forests have followed very different trajectories. State policies driven by industrial demands were in direct conflict with the customary use of forests by forest populations. Colonial state policies since 1894 and post-independence forest policies have characterized tribals as indiscriminate users of forests and therefore sought to protect forests from the tribals. "Despite the policy thrusts and legislative instruments to curtail the use of forests by the local people, forest dwellers continued to find access to forests. This was due to the overwhelming dependence of the forest dwellers which make it difficult to fully
administer the laws" (Pathak, 1994, pp. 27-28). In the last five years, under the joint forest management policy of the Indian government, various state governments have experimented with devolving authority for forest management to local communities. This new approach to control, protection and management of forests - joint forest management (JFM) - has profound implications for forest dwelling tribals.
JFM policies, when viewed from a gender perspective, have significant consequences for women in tribal communities. Women are the linchpin that connects the livelihood strategies of tribal households with forest wealth. Tribal women are largely responsible for collecting and processing many of the forest products. Therefore, for JFM policies to be successful in promoting sustainable forest management by tribal communities, it must involve tribal women in deliberate and significant ways.
This publication focuses on the dependence of tribal households on forests in the Eastern Ghats of Andhra Pradesh, India, and the implications for state and community partnerships in managing these forests. Particular attention is given to the gender dimensions of forest use in tribal villages and the implications for the implementation of Joint Forest Management Program being undertaken in Andhra Pradesh. The publication addresses several inter-related issues:
1. the role of forests and non-wood forest products (NWFPs) in the survival strategies of tribal households in Vishakapatnam district of Andhra Pradesh;
2. the important role women play in the daily survival strategies of tribals; and
3. the ensuing lessons and implications for planning and implementing JFM initiated forest protection committees in tribal villages.
The following discussion is multi-dimensional. The goal is to explore the critical role that tribal women play in sustaining tribal households and the resulting implications for crafting and implementing forest co-management programs that are sensitive to the pivotal role played by women in extracting forest products. This publication is based on primary and secondary data - qualitative as well as quantitative - from the high altitude region of Andhra Pradesh.

Joint forest management: State-community partnership in forest management
Joint forest management: State-community partnership in forest management
Historically, Indian forest policies have alienated people from the forests, thereby, exacerbating the rates of deforestation. Post-independence forest policies contributed to an expansion in agricultural production, met industrial demand for raw materials, and tightened control of forest lands through restricted access to forests and forest products (Haeuber, 1993). Protection policies increased the hardships of vulnerable social groups by denying them access to forests (Barraclough and Ghimire, 1995). While the state took responsibility for managing forest resources, it did not have the commensurate resources to effectively manage and police the forests from traditional users. Before state intervention, forests were managed as communal property; the crucial role of forests in the economic subsistence of individuals, families and community was the basis for managing them as communal resources (Chopra et al., 1990). A failure to recognize community control of forests led to
a collapse in institutional norms that were instrumental in protecting and managing forest resources for local use. A shift in property rights to the state steadily undermined the rights of tribals to use and extract forest resources.
Beginning with the National Forest Policy of 1988 to the current JFM policy, the thrust of Indian forest policy has been to forge management partnerships with local communities. In re-discovering a legitimate role for local communities in self-governance of forests, the state has begun to devolve control over forests. The 1988 National Forestry Policy outlined four basic objectives (Society for Promotion of Wastelands Development, 1 993):
o environmental stability;
o biodiversity conservation;
o meet basic needs of people; and
o protect the customary rights of tribals and other people living in and around forests.
The limited success of social forestry in providing forest resources to local communities, the continued rate of deforestation and the perpetual conflicts between people and forest departments prompted the Indian government to consider a set of policy proposals that is a radical departure from existing forest policies.
Moreover, the success of joint state and community forest management experiments in Arabari, West Bengal and Sukhomajri in Haryana, provided a framework for decentralizing forest management. It was evident from these experiments that local populations have to be given a stake in the forests. By making them viable stake holders, it might be possible to regenerate, protect, and manage forest resources for the joint benefit of the people and the state. The 1988 National Forest Policy together with a circular issued by the Indian government in 1990 legitimize local communities' access to forests, encourage communities to form forest management committees, and guarantee a portion of the produce from the forests (Singh and Khare, 1993). JFM, as the new policy proposal, promotes a partnership between the state and local communities to manage forests for the benefit of the people and the state. Co-management links forest protection and the livelihood strategies of the people.
The Indian government and fifteen state governments, between 1988 and 1994, have sought to increase the participation of people in forests through the JFM Program. Essentially, JFM initiatives provide, "participating villagers free access to most NTFPs and a 25 to 50 percent share of poles and timber at final harvesting. In return, the villagers are expected to protect the forests after forming an organization conforming to the membership and structure specified by the forest department" (Sarin, 1995a). JFM, through such partnerships, attempts to change existing conditions of forest resources and the nature of community and individual activities as they relate to forest resource extraction, particularly to:
o affect patterns of forest use at the local level;
o improve the condition of forests at the local level;
o bolster collective action around forest resources at the community level; and
o improve the management of forest resources for the social and economic development of local populations and for biodiversity conservation.
According to some estimates, 15,000 forest protection committees (FPCs) are currently operating in India, stretching across southern Bihar, West Bengal, Orissa and the northern tribal regions of Andhra Pradesh (Poffenberger, 1995). Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have also been playing an important role in facilitating this new partnership between forest departments and local communities by instrumentally articulating the needs of forest dependent people to the state.
Under JFM, households in a village or a cluster of villages have the right to become members of a forest protection group. A management committee representing this group is then constituted to implement the JFM plan. The managing committee has a two-year term. The committee is composed of 10 to 15 elected representatives of its members with 30 percent of its posts to be filled by women. The committee also consists of a forest guard, representatives from NGOs, village officials, representative of the tribal development authority in cases involving a tribal area, and a deputy range officer.
Responsibilities of the forest protection committee or the Vana Samrakshana Samithi (VSS) include protection against grazing, fires and thefts of forest produce; development of forests in accordance with the management plan; and assisting forest officers in the development of forests (Society for Promotion of Wastelands Development, 1993). The VSS has usufruct rights to non-reserved items such as leaf and grass fodder, thatch grass, broom grass, thorny fencing materials from specified species, fallen lops, tops, and twigs used for fuel, but has no automatic right to products classified as reserved items like the tendu leaves that have been previously leased. The committee, after 3 years of its formation, is entitled to 25 percent of timber and poles harvested. Unused portion of the 25 percent will be sold by the forest department and the revenue will be given back to the committee. The VSS is also entitled to one third of the revenue from the 75 percent share of the forest
department.
In essence, the stakes are high, and the need to ensure the involvement of those who are primary users of forests is imperative. In order for JFM to be successful in Andhra Pradesh, it is critical that any policy must first and foremost positively affect the lives of tribals whose livelihood strategies are closely inter-linked with the forests. Equally important, forest management strategies must be cognizant of the gender dimensions of forest use in the tribal regions of Andhra Pradesh.

Tribal household economy, forests, and the role of women
Tribal household economy, forests, and the role of women
Forests and forest resources, primarily minor forest products (MFP) or NWFPs, play an important role in the viability and survival of tribal households in Andhra Pradesh and elsewhere in India, because of the importance of forests in their social, cultural and economic survival (Tewari, 1989). Estimates of the revenue contributions of NWFPs in India vary considerably. Some estimate that NWFPs contribute US$ 208 million to the Indian economy while another calculation places the revenues from NWFPs at US$ 645 million (Lele et al., 1994). Yet another figure offered by Poffenberger estimates that the total annual value of NWFPs from the central Indian tribal belt alone exceeds US$ 500 million (Poffenberger, 1990a). All of the estimates, despite their variations, lead to the conclusion that collecting and processing of NWFPs are economically significant activities for forest dependent tribals. Studies conducted in the tribal regions of north-east India also indicate high rates of
dependence on forests to meet fuelwood needs (Maikhuri, 1991).
Recent studies conducted in the tribal regions of Bihar, West Bengal and Karnataka offer further empirical evidence for the extent of dependence of tribal households on NWFP collection. For example, in two southern districts of Bihar, 41 percent of the families collect mahua flowers (Madhuca indica); 31 percent collect tendu leaves (Diospyros melanoxylon) used in making indigenous cigarettes (or bid)); 23 percent of the families collect mushrooms and mahua seeds; 55 percent of the families collect tamarind (Tamarindus indica); and 31 percent of the families depend on the collection of wild brooms (Rao and Singh, 1996). Even higher rates, ranging between 5673 percent, have been recorded in Midnapore district of West Bengal (Rao and Singh, 1996, p. 338). Hegde et al.(1996), in a study of Soliga households, found that the income contribution from the collection of NWFPs is disproportionately greater than the time spent in collecting the products. Their study indicated that
households living on the periphery of the forest spend 39.25 percent of their time in collection and realize 47.63 percent of their income from NWFPs; for tribals living closer to the forest, the figures are 54.46 percent and 60.44 percent respectively. Moreover, "...variance in income from the extraction of NTFPs is much less than that of income from other vocations, indicating that the collection of NTFPs constitutes the most reliable source of income" (Hedge et al., 1996, pp. 248, 249-250). The critical role that NWFPs play in the livelihood strategies of tribal households is highlighted by the very favorable income returns to the time spent in collection, and the stability of income from NWFPs.
Recognizing this importance of NWFPs is critical to crafting tribal sensitive forest policies. Others have noted the important role of NWFPs not only in meeting the subsistence needs but also in poverty alleviation of tribals (FAO, 1995). More importantly, however, any community-based strategy to use and manage forests must consider the gender issue in order to have a lasting impact.
The primary players in the collection, processing, and marketing of NWFPs are women who gather the bulk of forest produce, including food and fuel-related forest products. Women also gather NWFPs that are primarily sold in the market. Men are mainly responsible for construction timber, poles and some collection of medicinal plants which are also gathered by women. The importance of women in collection of forest produce is borne by data from almost every country in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. For instance, a study in the North-West Frontier Province of Pakistan showed that 78 percent of morel mushrooms are collected by women and children (Iqbal, 1991). The same study also showed that while women and children are the dominant players in collecting and drying, men (53 percent) play a much more active role in selling the morels. Similarly, women and children collect 90 percent of the medicinal herbs and 100 percent of the drying is done by women. About 71 percent of
medicinal herbs are sold by women and children, and 29 percent by men.
Similarly, in West Bengal, tribal women gather sal (Shorea robusta) leaves for six months of the year and make about Rs. 72 (US$ 2.16)^1 per month under the best circumstances (Rajan, 1995 Poffenberger, 1990b). Throughout India, collection of tendu leaf (Diospyros melanoxylon) generates part time employment for 7.5 million people - a majority of them tribal women (Arnold, 1995). Women, according to studies in Uttar Pradesh, derive a greater proportion of their income from forests and common lands; poor women derive 45 percent of their income from forests and common lands as opposed to 13 percent for men (FAO and SIDA, 1991). Fernandes and Menon (1987), based on a study done in Orissa, reported that women generally walk 3 to 4 hours into the forests and work 15 hours per day, whereas men work 11 hours a day. The studies all indicated that women spend more time and labor in forest-related activities, and depend on forests not only to meet subsistence needs but also for income.
Interestingly, the considerable role played by women in ensuring food security, and in the provision of cash income from the sale of NWFPs gives women a higher status in tribal societies (Sarkar, 1994). The differential roles and responsibilities of men and women vis-à-vis forests and the concomitant social and economic consequences for tribal households at large, and women in particular, are considerable.

FOREST DEPENDENCE OF TRIBALS IN ANDHRA PRADESH
Tribals in Andhra Pradesh collect a large variety of NWFPs including tamarind (Tamarindus indica), adda leaf (Bauhinia vahlii), gum karaya (Sterculia urens), myrobalans, mahua flowers and seeds (Madhuca indica), wild brooms and soap nuts (Sapindus emarginatus). One study estimated that income from the sale of NWFP in Andhra Pradesh constitutes anywhere from 10 to 55 percent of total household income. In comparison to Orissa, Bihar and Madhya Pradesh, all with large tribal populations, tribal households from Andhra Pradesh accrue a very high proportion of their income from the sale of NWFPs (Burman, 1990). From an economic perspective, NWFPs play a central role in the livelihood strategies of tribal households in Vishakapatnam district as well as in the entire Eastern Ghats region. Tewari (1989) estimated that in Andhra Pradesh, 10 to 55 percent of income of tribal households comes directly from the sale of NWFPs and this dependence increases markedly as a tribal household
becomes more marginalized.
Dependence on forests and common property resources increases as a household becomes economically marginalized. Ramamani (1988), in a study of tribal economy in Srikakulam District in the Eastern Ghats of Andhra Pradesh, disaggregated tribal dependence on forests. The more marginal a tribal household, the greater is the proportion of its income from forests. Data indicated that sub-marginal and marginal tribal households accrue 35 to 36 percent of their income from forest produce. As poverty increases, women become more prominent in ensuring the survival of households by assuming greater responsibility to provide resources from forests and common lands. The importance of NWFPs for the very poor tribal households has been well documented by other studies as well (Hedge et al., 1996; Godoy et al., 1995). In Andhra Pradesh, the poor obtain 84 percent of their fuel supplies from common property resources, and are employed for 139 days to collect products from common property
resources (Jodha, 1992). "....The inextricable link between land resources and rural livelihoods, along with increasing role of women as household providers in declining rural economies, stresses the need to consider the gendered terms of access and control of the resource base, particularly in ecologically vulnerable regions" (Thomas-Slayter and Rocheleau, 1995).
The economic significance of the time and energy spent by women in collecting and processing NWFPs is enormous considering their substantial contributions to the income of tribal households in Andhra Pradesh. The next section gives a detailed account of forest-based activities in four tribal panchayats of Vishakapatnam district and illustrates the forest dependence of tribals. Qualitative data on the nature of forest-based activities will be provided and then quantitative data from two preliminary studies of tribal household income flows are presented.

Study area and methods
Study area and methods
A field study of tribal households was conducted in the high altitude area zone of the Eastern Ghats region of Andhra Pradesh, the fifth largest state in India. The state has a population of 66.5 million, 73 percent of which lives in rural areas. The high altitude area zone lies between 17°.13' - 19°.09' N and 80°.22' - 84°.33' E, accounting for 6.56 percent of the total area of Andhra Pradesh (National Agricultural Research Project, 1994). Villages included in the study are located at altitudes ranging from 150 to 900 m. Moist deciduous and dry deciduous forest types are predominant.
Data were acquired in two phases. Household data from the two hamlets of Nimmalapadu were collected during surveys conducted between April and October, 1995. Information was obtained on land holding of each family, investments in land development, annual income per acre of land, type of trees on owned land and income from the trees, NWFPs collected by each household, and annual income from NWFPs.

Qualitative data on forest-based activities in the four panchayats of Vishakapatnam district were collected from December 1995 to January 1996. Data on ten additional tribal households were also gathered from eight villages during this same period through long interviews with family members. In these interviews, household members were asked to disaggregate their sources of income and expenditures, and then estimate the relative contribution of NWFPs to household income. All of the interviews were conducted in Telugu, the local language.

Forest-based activities in four Panchayats of Vishakapatnam district
Description of the Panchayats
Forest-based activities in four Panchayats of Vishakapatnam district
Description of the Panchayats
Sovva Panchayat is an interior panchayat bordering Orissa state and is 21 km away from the nearest road. The 21 villages in the panchayat are all tribal with a total population of 4,193. Some of the tribal groups are Bagatas, Valmikis, Nookadoras, Malis, and Kutias. Elevation in this region varies from 750 to 900 m. There is neither electricity nor drinking water facilities and the valley has no paved roads. The reserved forest here is completely degraded. Tribals depend on agriculture and vegetable cultivation. Shifting cultivation (podu) is extensively practiced on hill slopes.
Hills that were once forested in Sovva Panchayat
In contrast to other tribal areas, the people of Sovva have very few forest-based activities due to the absence of forest cover. They face extreme shortages of fodder, fuelwood and timber. Women walk a distance of 10-12 km twice a week for firewood. A frequent source of fuel in this region is the dung cakes prepared by the women. The practice of using dung cakes for fuel is unusual in the tribal regions of the Eastern Ghats. Livestock is taken to neighboring regions in search of fodder. Women and children are primarily responsible for grazing the cattle. To obtain construction timber, the tribals travel anywhere from 30 to 120 km. To procure grass for thatching, they travel to the neighboring state of Orissa which is a day's walk For medicinal plants and herbs that are widely used in the villages, medicine men travel for at least two months in the forests more than 100 km away. Approximately 70 percent of all the work is done by women and female children. This includes work
related to agriculture, forest produce collection and domestic chores. Men are primarily responsible for plowing the fields and carrying vegetables to the shandy (weekly market).
About 95 percent of the population in Borra Panchayat are identified as tribal people. The elevation of this area is 750 m. The panchayat comprises fourteen villages with 200 families and a total population of 1,900 people. The tribals in this area belong to Bagata, Kutia, Nookadora and Valmiki tribes. The demarcation of reserve forest falls close to the inhabited villages and is a source of conflict between the tribals and the forest department. Tribals use the forests as sources of NWFPs, fuelwood, housing materials, medicinal herbs, water and irrigation, and for grazing their cattle, hunting and charcoal making.
Weekly market (shandy) in a tribal village, Vishakapatnam district in Andhra Pradesh
Several different NWFPs in Borra Panchayat are collected by tribal women such as adda leaves (Bauhinia vahlii) used for sowing plates, karaka (Myrobalanus chebula), usiri or amla fruits (Emblica officinalis), tamarind (Tamarindus indica), nalla jeedi or marking nuts (Semecarpus anacardium), kanuga (Pongamia glabra), jack (Artocarpus heterophyllus), and mango (Mangifera indica). It is very labor intensive to collect many of these forest products. In the case of adda leaves and tamarind, women play a major role in collecting, drying, packing them into baskets and carrying the processed products to the shandy. Stall feeding of cattle is not practiced in this area. Men take the cattle out for grazing and travel anywhere between 4 to 10 km from their villages. For firewood, both men and women travel 2 to 3 km once every two days. Women, however, spend more time collecting dry twigs and logs whereas men fell trees and take them back to the village. It is women, however, who go for
firewood collection, especially during the agricultural season when men are busy plowing the fields. It is not uncommon for women to gather wild tubers and roots while collecting firewood.
Salugu Panchayat is an interior pocket of the Paderu Mandal. The altitude in this region ranges from 600 to 900 m. The panchayat consists of 24 villages and hamlets belonging to different tribal groups like the Bagatas, Valmikis, Nookadoras, Kondadoras, Konda Kammaras and Khonds. The total population of the panchayat is 2,500. Apart from paddy, agriculture is primarily on dry land. Minor cereals, millets, pulses, redgram, and oilseeds like niger and castor, are the main cash crops. Shifting cultivation is widely practiced in this panchayat.
Collection of NWFPs is widespread in the villages of Salugu Panchayat. The area has rich natural forests consisting of mango, tamarind, jack, custard (Annona squamosa), lemon, cleaning nut or induga (Strychnos potatorum), karaka, kanuga, gum karaya (Sterculia urens), adda leaves for plate making, rosewood (Dalbergia latifolia) and bamboo. Tamarind is collected by men and women. On average a family earns Rs. 200 to 600 (US$ 6 to 18) per tamarind tree. In this area, tribals collect NWFPs nine months out of the year. Women collect adda leaves and may spend 7 hours a day collecting the leaves when they are in season. These leaves are dried for 2 days, packed into 50 kg shoulder loads for men and 30 kg for women to be carried to the weekly market. A shoulder load of leaves fetches anywhere between Rs. 50 (US$ 1.50) and Rs. 120 (US$ 3.60) depending on the season and quality of the leaves. Each tribal household requires 20 to 25 headloads of firewood for cooking and keeping
themselves warm in the winter. While women gather fallen branches and twigs, men cut trees for firewood. Cattle are taken up to 5 to 6 km into the forest for grazing. Children and women graze the cattle 20 days per month and the men take the cattle out the remaining 10 days. It is not uncommon for women and children to collect NWFPs while they are out with the cattle in the forest.
Sarugudu Panchayat is closer to the plains but is one of the better forested areas. The panchayat has 16 villages with a population of 600 families. Tribal groups include Bagatas, Kondakapus, Konda Kammaras, Konda Doras and Valmikis. The elevation in this region varies between 150 and 450 m.
The forest-based economy is vibrant in and around Sarugudu Panchayat. NWFPs gathered include tamarind, gum karaya, marking nuts, honey, kanuga, cleaning nuts and soap nuts (Sapindus emarginatus). Households depend on NWFP collection for 6 months in a year. Gum karaya is very lucrative as it fetches a good price (US$ 4.00 per kg) at the government sponsored cooperative. While women are primarily responsible for collecting most of the forest produce, it is men and boys who are responsible for cattle grazing. Collecting forest products fo
