1. Introduction
1.1 Objectives
The primary objective of this study is to analyse and assess woodfuel consumption in the household sector on the basis of the 1994 wood consumption survey data. Under this generalized objective the terms of reference identified the following:
(a) Present and review basic tables concerning the consumption of woodfuels in the household sector.
(b) Assess the variations in per capita and total consumption of woodfuels in the household sector.
(c) Assess various supply management issues related to woodfuel used, collection versus purchase of woodfuels and collection patterns.
(d) Assess the role of woodfuels in the household energy supply and their relative contribution in the energy budget.
(e) Present and review consumption of non-woody biomass in the household sector.
1.2 Methodology
Woodfuel consumption covers consumption of firewood, charcoal, dukhan wood and other biomass (namely agricultural residues and saw-dust). The analysis of the woodfuel situation in the household sector will be based only on the 1994 consumption survey data and covers three major aspects:
(a) Woodfuel consumption patterns where consumption expressed in terms of annual per capita and/or annual household will be carried out. This will provide the basis and guideline for future assessment of woodfuel consumption and is a useful planning figure.
(b) Current consumption aspect where the 1994 consumption estimates for individual woodfuels will be analysed.
(c) Supply management and wood resource needs where the major supply issues will be addressed in terms of woodfuel commodotization (purchase, collection etc), total resource needs and wood type used and its impact on the sustainability of the resource base.
For the above three aspects a common analytical framework will be used for the analysis. The common analytical framework has a set of parameters namely:
(i) Urbanization (rural/urban)
(ii) Income level where households are categorized into three income classes low (<Ls. 150,000), medium (<Ls. 150 000 - 300 000) and high (>Ls. 300 000).
(iii) Ecological zone where Northern Sudan is divided into four ecological zones: Desert Semi-desert, low rainfall and high rainfall zones.
(iv) Education level of the head of household. Six education levels were identified covering illiterate, Khalwa, Preliminary, intermediate, secondary and university levels.
(v) Northern Sudan and State Levels.
The 1994 national Survey data forms the basis of the analysis. The survey sampled 7500 households drawn from 53 provinces in Northern Sudan.
1.3 Report organization
The report is composed of five chapters and an executive summary. Chapter one as an introduction addressing the report objectives, methodology used and its organization. Woodfuel consumption patterns are analysed in Chapter Two. chapter three review the 1994 current woodfuel consumption as appeared from the 1993/94 consumption survey. Supply management issues and resource requirements are discussed in chapter four. Chapter five is conclusions.

2. Household woodfuel consumption patterns
Woodfuel consumption patterns analysis covers household woodfuel dependency, consumption per capita and its variation, under different socio-economic and environmental factors prevailing in Northern Sudan. Four major factors will be considered covering income education, urbanization and ecological zone.
2.1 Household woodfuel dependency
Dependency is defined by the percentage of households using firewood, charcoal or both.
At the national level the survey results clearly indicate a high dependency rate by households in Northern Sudan. Table 2.1 below presents the survey results:

(a) In aggregate household dependency in N. Sudan is generally high totalling on average (94.8%). urban households dependency (97%) is slightly higher than for rural households (93.6%). This situation reflect the greater usage of non-woody biomass by rural households. It also reflect the increased dependency of urban areas on woodfuel due to economic hardships and availability/access to other modern fuels.
(b) Even at the aggregate national level a distinct dependency pattern by woodfuel type tend to emerge. While firewood is more associated with rural households (85.1%), charcoal is mainly an urban fuel with a dependency rate of 88.9%. However despite this generalization, indications are emerging where such patterns are beginning to change. The survey results show clearly that firewood still remains a significant fuel for urban households (65.6% dependency rate). Similarly, there are trends of increased charcoal use by rural households (32.3% dependency). These changes are triggered by socioeconomic and environ mental factors (resource depletion). The significant use of firewood in urban areas, contrary to prevailing premises, can be explained by socioeconomic factors. Files and ranks of urban population continued to be intensively swollen by flows of rural migrants due to drought, economic hardships and civil strife. Such migrations led gradually to the ruralization of
urban areas.
Increased charcoal use in rural areas on the other hand seems to he associated with income rises, closeness to areas of commercial charcoal production zones (urban charcoal supply centres) characterized by charcoal abundancy and relative low prices and in areas where firewood collection/supply catchment areas are further distanced (due to degradation and desertification) to permit its economic transport.
(c) At the state level; the survey results except for a few exceptions, a high woodfuel dependency-ranging between 99.3% and 77.9% is exhibited.
(i) High rural firewood dependency compared to urban areas is generally valid for all states. The White Nile state however is the only exception where urban firewood dependency (92.1 %) by far exceeds that for rural households (58.4 %). Rural White Nile state households tend to extensively depend more on agricultural and animal waste than firewood.
(ii) Household charcoal dependency rate generally exhibit the reverse patterns for firewood. Rural populations for most the states (few exceptions) show a relatively low dependency rate when compared to urban households. Exceptions to this pattern include Sennar (82.7%), Gezira (69.8%), Khartoum (69.7%), North Kordofan (49.8%) and Gedaref (44.7%). These are either areas where firewood supply catchments are further away (e.g. Khartoum, Gezira) or near zones of commercial charcoal production zones (e.g. Gedaref, Sennar). Western states are all of particularly low charcoal rural dependency rate ranging between 1.9% (W. Darfur) to 5.1% (N. Darfur). In contrast all these states exhibited the highest firewood dependency rates (99% and 99.4% respectively). These are areas, which in general, fall within the high rainfall or rich savanna areas characterized by their extensive resource base.
2.2 Annual household and per capita woodfuel consumption pattern
Household and per capita woodfuel pattern exhibit distinct variation with urbanization. Table 2.2 presents a national overview for N. Sudan.

(a) While rural households consume on average 2.08 m^3 of firewood annually, urban ones consume only 0.78 m^3. Charcoal shows the reverse where urban households annual consumption (711 kg) is more than threefold of rural households (218 kg).
(b) Per capita consumption values are consistent with household annual values. Rural firewood per capita (0.46 m^3) is three times that of urban households (0.14 m^3). Charcoal per capita shows the reverse (0.57 m^3 for urban and 0.17 m^3 for rural).
2.3 Consumption patterns and environmental and socio-economic factors
Three major factors will be considered and their effects on household woodfuel consumption patterns will be analysed. These are the ecological zone, income and household education level.
2.3.1 Consumption patterns by ecological zone
Analysis of woodfuel consumption patterns by ecological zones reflect the impact of natural wood resource scarcity on consumption patterns. It also reflect the pressures to which the rather fragile ecosystems are subjected to. For the purpose of this analysis, Northern Sudan is classified into basically four zones. Desert, semi-desert, low-rainfall and high rainfall zones. Table 2.3 below presents the results of the analysis.

(a) Desert areas which comprise mainly the Northern strips along the Nile, households consume high quantities of firewood 2.06 M^3 year. This is even higher than the figures of the high rainfall areas where the wood resource is more abundant. This amount of high firewood consumption in desert zones should be viewed in the context of` the type of firewood used and the geographical locations where the samples were taken in villages and towns along the Nile. These areas are generally characterized by the sole use of palm trees branches and other fruit tree crops as firewood. This in itself indicates the importance of integrated agroforestry approach on one hand and the need by forest nurseries to broaden their species selection to include fruit trees on the other.
Charcoal household annual consumption in the desert zone is the lowest among all other zones. This is consistent with the absence of the wood resource base within an economic distance to allow the flow of raw materials needed for carbonization under the prevailing technologies. There seems, however, to be wide variations in charcoal consumption in the desert zone with urbanization. Urban household annual consumption for charcoal (479 kg) is more than five folds of rural households (90 kg). Firewood on the other hand shows only slight difference with urbanization.
(b) The semi-desert zone show the highest charcoal household consumption (both for rural and urban) and the lowest household firewood consumption. It is generally heavily populated where most of the densly populated urban centers are found and where irrigated large agricultural schemes are developed. The natural forest resource base is poor and hence dependency on distant supply catchment areas southwards. This offers an explanation to their high charcoal dependency and/or consumption. Firewood however still remains a significant woodfuel in rural areas of the semi-desert zone comprised mainly of bushes and small tree branches. Urban household firewood consumption is however the least in the country.
(c) Low rainfall savanna areas are characterized by medium-high annual household consumption patterns for both firewood and charcoal. In fact it exhibited the highest annual household firewood consumption in rural areas of N. Sudan (2.15 m^3 Low rainfall savanna areas are generally areas where low grade (branches/bushes) firewood is relatively abundant; and where traditional commercial charcoal production zones associated with agricultural expansion tress clearance was heavily practiced. Present trends however with accelerated tree resources depletion, show the gradual shift of semi-desert household consumption patterns.
The consumption patterns of the semi-desert and low rainfall savanna areas have the most significant impact on the woodfuel resources base due to their high population density, degree of urbanization and charcoal dependency.
(d) High rainfall areas from the present survey exhibit a high household annual consumption for firewood and charcoal. The high firewood consumption is consistent with both the dominant culture (pastoralism) of firewood use only and the availability and accessibility of the wood resource base which characterize this zone. The high charcoal consumption pattern is not consistent and must be questioned. The sampling limitation to a charcoal commercial production site need to broadened to include other high rainfall sites to correct or confirm this anamoly.
(e) Annual per capita consumption data by ecological zone show similar tendencies as shown by household annual consumption for firewood and charcoal as presented in table 3.4 below. Low rainfall has the highest woodfuel per capita (0.70 M^3), followed by the semi-dessert (0.64 m^3 high rainfall (0.63 m^3 and the desert areas with the lowest woodfuel per capita of 0.56 m^3

2.3.2 Woodfuel consumption patterns and household income
Three income levels were defined by the survey. These are low (<150000), medium (Ls. 150 000 - Ls. 30 000) and high (Ls. 7300 000) income households. Analysis of household annual woodfuel consumption by income is presented in table 2.5 below.

(a) There is a clear association between woodfuel consumption patterns and income level for both rural and urban households. It is reflected in both the magnitude of consumption and the fuel mix (firewood versus charcoal) patterns. The general trend shows that while firewood consumption decreases with income rise, charcoal consumption shows the reverse and generally increases with income.
(b) The survey data reveals a 30% drop in annual rural household firewood consumption as they move from the low to the medium income ladder. The drop in consumption decreases to 13% as income shifts from the medium to the high level. similar phenomenon is exhibited by urban household firewood consumption.
(c) The rise in charcoal consumption with income is much significant particularly in rural areas. High income rural households consumption is about eight folds of low income ones. This indicates substantial charcoal requirements with changes in rural income. For urban households where charcoal consumption is already high, income changes are associated with consumption increases by a factor of 2.5 or 1.7 for high and medium income households - using low income consumption level as basis. This may also reflect opportunities by modern fuel substitution.
(d) Analysis of consumption patterns in the various ecological zones by income level presented in table 2.6 shows the following:
(i) In desert areas where firewood is mostly the fuel used, consumption of firewood increases with income in rural and urban areas. There seems to be-a substitution effect in high income groups in the urban sub-sector. Firewood consumption dropped in urban areas as income rises from medium to high level.
(ii) For the rest of the ecological zones household firewood consumption per year tend to decrease for both urban and rural households with income rises.
(iii) Charcoal consumption patterns by ecological zones with income show tile same tendencies of increased household consumption per year as income rises.

2.3.3 Woodfuel consumption pattern and household education
Household education in this analysis is limited to only the head of the household. Six education levels were identified: illiterate, Khalwa (quranic school), preliminary, intermediate, secondary and university. Table 2.6 presents the results of the analysis.

(a) There seems to be an association between woodfuel consumption patterns and household education.
(b) Firewood household annual consumption in both rural and urban areas decreases as the level of education rises. It decreased from 2.3 M^3 for illiterate households to 1.36 M^3 for university graduates (41 %). This decrease however can not be attributed to conservation rather it is shifting to other accessible high quality fuels - mainly charcoal in this case. The only exception to this general pattern is the case of Khalwa education level households whose consumption is higher than in the previous education ladder. This can be explained by their frequent use of firewood for lighting needed to read the quoran.
Similarly firewood consumption in urban areas decreases with rise hi education level from 1 09 m for illiterate to 0.43 m^3 for graduates due to shifting to other fuels rather than conservation.
(c) Charcoal consumption shows a different pattern with education level. 1 general in both rural and urban settings there is an increase in consumption with education level rise. This trend applies all through the education levels in rural households - with consumption increasing from 153 kg. per households per year for illiterates to 545 Kg/year for graduates. The case for urban households differs slightly. Charcoal consumption increases with rise of education to a certain level (intermediate school) and then begins to drop gradually with education level rises . This indicates the shift to modern fuels (butagas etc) with certain education levels.
(d) The above apparent trends at national aggregate level are not universally applicable to each situation at state, province or district level. There are cases where firewood consumption tend to increase with education (Northern state). Such differences in trends indicate that other factors with education level (income, accessibility and price of other fuels etc) seem to govern the pattern of household woodfuel consumption.
2.4 Woodfuel per capita state level analysis
This refers to per capita consumption of firewood and charcoal. Combined in terms of roundwood requirements. Table 2.7 presents the per capita values for the different states. The following observations can be made.

(a) Per-capita consumption for rural woodfuel exhibit wide variations between states and ranges between 0.43 M^3 to 0.97 M^3 with a national aggregate of 0.7 M^3 for all N. Sudan of the 16 states five states are higher than this national aggregate, while values for the remaining eleven states are lower.
(b) In general high woodfuel (charcoal + firewood) per capita values are associated with either intensive use of firewood (N. Darfur, S. Darfur and Est Darfur) or medium to high use of both firewood and charcoal (Blue-Nile).
(c) Areas of the highest charcoal per capita (Gezira and Khartoum) exhibit the lowest firewood per capita. Areas of low charcoal per capita, on the other hand, are characterized by high firewood per capita. This reflects the wide opportunities of interfuel substitution between these two woodfuel types.
(d) States that are characterized by medium-high per capita consumption values for both charcoal and firewood (Blue-Nile) represent regions in transition towards the high charcoal low firewood consumption patterns as their relatively rich accessible wood resources deteriorate. Although such deterioration is showing at an accelerated pace.
(e) Khartoum, Gezira and Sennar states show the highest charcoal per capita. While Khartoum and Gezira are troth in the semi-desert depending on supply catchment areas more than 500 Km away, Sennar, in the low rainfall zone, is relatively close to traditional charcoal commercial production zone.
All western states, except for the semi-desert state of North Kordofan, have the lowest charcoal per capita. These are areas where the cooking and nutritional habits are tuned for the direct use of firewood. In addition they are all located in ecological zones where the wood resources are relatively rich, available and less subjected to deforestation.
The Northern desert state along the Nile also exhibit a low charcoal per capita. This is consistent with the prevailing high dependency on fruit tree branches (palm trees) as household woodfuel.
(f) Western states (except for North Kordofan) show the highest firewood per capita ranging between 0.82 M^3 to 0.73 M^3 for the three Darfur states. The situation as revealed by the survey for south Kordofan is particularly low (0.32 M^3 firewood per capita) and already an additional survey check is currently being undertaken.
(d) Classification of per capita at state level for woodfuel consumption by fuel type and urbanization is presented in table 2.8.

2.5 Woodfuel and household energy consumption patterns
Analysis of household energy consumption patterns reveals the significant role of woody and non-woody biomass in the provision of energy for the sector. Table 2.9 presents the results of this analysis.

(a) In N. Sudan per capita energy consumption in the household sector is estimated to be 0.199 TOE
(b) By fuel type biomass energy (woody and non-woody) contributes the most. Total biomass fuels contribution for household energy needs is estimated to be 93%. The remaining 7% is contributed by modern fuels. Individual fuel type contributions as shown in table 2.9 shows the significant role of firewood (55.2%), charcoal (25.1) and agricultural residues (10%).
(c) There are significant differences between rural and urban households:
(i) In absolute terms rural household energy per capita is generally higher than urban per capita (0.215 toe for rural per capita and 0.167 toe for urban).
(ii) The high contribution of charcoal in urban energy supply. Its contribution to household energy per capita is 55.6% for urban households compared to only 14% in rural households. In contrast firewood share in energy per capita for rural households (65.1%) is much higher than urban households (24.7%).
(iii) Similarly the share of agricultural residue, in rural energy per capita is equivalent to that of charcoal (14%) compared to only 3.1% in urban household energy per capita. The share of modern fuels (LPC, petroleum and electricity) is generally low ranging between 11.7% in urban and 5.4 for rural per capita.

3. Households woodfuel current consumption for 1994
This section of the report, using the 1994 consumption survey and the consumption patterns discussed in chapter 2 will review total woodfuel consumption in N. Sudan.
Total consumption analysis will be attempted in aggregate (national) and desegregate (state level) terms. The national picture will be presented using the parameters of urbanization, ecological zone, income level and education. At the state level only urbanization will be considered.
3.1 National perspective
3.1.1 Firewood consumption
(a) Rural and urban consumption of firewood
The current firewood consumption in Northern Sudan is estimated to be 5.9 million cubic meters in 1994. Of this total amount 14.5% (0.86 million M^3 is consumed by urban households, while the remaining 85.5% is consumed by rural households. This distribution pattern is consistent with the higher rural per capita and the population density - which comprise according to 1994 census about 66% of the total population in N. Sudan.

(b) Firewood Consumption by Ecological Zone
The low rainfall zone ranks the highest in firewood consumption (73.1%), followed by the semi-desert zone (23.4%), the desert zone (3.2%) and the high rainfall zones consuming the lowest firewood quantities (0.3%). This distribution pattern is due mainly to population density and per capita annual consumption in each zone.

(c) Firewood Consumption by Income Level
The overall analysis of firewood consumption by household income for 1994 shows that 42.4%, 34.8% and 22.8% of the firewood is consumed by low, medium and high income households respectively. This is consistent with per capita and distribution of population among the different income levels.

When viewed in rural and urban contexts, rural consumption by income group is consistent with the overall trend with low, medium and high income households consuming 48.9%, 34.4% and 18.5% of the 1994 consumption respectively.
The case for urban households, however, tends to be inconsistent with the per capita pattern with income (decreasing with income). Both medium and high income groups total consumption is higher than low income households. This reflects the distribution of households among the different income levels. The levels as determined in the survey analysis tend to accumulate most of the urban households in the bigger (62.8%) and medium (28.8%) income bracket. This need to be reviewed on the basis of expenditure figures to allow for a more realistic distribution of urban households by income level.
(d) Firewood Consumption by level of education of head of households
Consumption by level of education (head of household only) is presented in table 3-4 and is generally in line with per capita consumption pattern and distribution of households among the different education levels

3.1.2 Charcoal Consumption
(a) Rural and urban charcoal consumption
N. Sudan consumed in 1994 a total of 32.779 million 40 Kg sacks. This is equivalent to 1.3 million tons of charcoal. Urban households consumed 59.6% (19.5 million sacks) while rural households consumed the remaining 40.4% (13.2 million sacks). This distribution is consistent with per capita patterns and population density in urban and rural areas.

(b) Charcoal Consumption by Ecological zone
Like firewood due mainly to population density and woodfuel consumption pattern (per capita) the semi-desert and low rainfall areas together consume the bulk of the charcoal in N. Sudan - (98.6) The other two zones (desert and high rainfall areas) consume only, 1.4% of the charcoal consumed in N. Sudan. While desert areas depend mainly on firewood produced from horticultural tree branches, the high rainfall depend on firewood abundantly available in the area.

(c) Charcoal consumption by income level
In contrast to firewood high income households consume 58.6% of the charcoal consumed. Low and medium income households consume 8.6% and 32.9% respectively. This is consistent with per capita consumption patterns for charcoal which increases with income.

(d) Charcoal consumed by level of education of head of households
Charcoal consumption by level of education of head of household is governed mainly by the number of households in each education category and the per capita consumption pattern for the different education levels. However the latter is generally increasing with rise in education level. The former (population in each category) more than outweigh any per capita effects when we deal with total absolute consumption quantities. The lowest three categories in the education category who comprise the bull; of the households in N. Sudan consumed 72.7% of the charcoal in 1994.

3.1.3 Dukhan wood consumption
This special type of end-use for firewood is characteric of Sudanese married women and is widely used in both rural and urban areas. Its use is more associated with marital status of women and less so with income or education level. Compared to woodfuel use for other household purposes (cooking) it is very small (% of that firewood for cooking).
During 1994 a total of 246449 cubic meters roundwood were consumed in N. Sudan. Rural households consumed 51.4 % while urban households consumed 48.6 %. The consumption of dukhan wood is generally strongly associated with married women by tradition.

3.1.4 Other biomass consumption
Significant quantities of other biomass fuels are also consumed by households. The two major fuels consumed in addition to firewood and charcoal are agricultural
