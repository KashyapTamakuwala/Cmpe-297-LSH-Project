INFORMATION NOTE ON ASIA-PACIFIC FORESTRY SECTOR OUTLOOK STUDY
At its sixteenth session held in Yangon, Myanmar, in January 1996, the Asia-Pacific Forestry Commission, which has membership open to all governments in the Asia-Pacific region, decided to carry out an outlook study for forestry with horizon year 2010. The study is being coordinated by FAO through its regional office in Bangkok and its Headquarters in Rome, but is being implemented in close partnership with governments, many of which have nominated national focal points.
The scope of the study is to look at the main external and sectoral developments in policies, programmes and institutions that will affect the forestry sector and to assess from this the likely direction of its evolution and to present its likely situation in 2010. The study involves assessment of current status but also of trends from the past and the main forces which are shaping those trends and then builds on this to explore future prospects.
Working papers have been contributed or commissioned on a wide range of topics. They fall under the following categories: country profiles, selected in-depth country or sub-regional studies and thematic studies. Working papers are prepared by individual authors or groups of authors on their own professional responsibility; therefore, the opinions expressed in them do not necessarily reflect the views of their employers, the governments of the Asia-Pacific Forestry Commission or of the Food and Agriculture Organization. In preparing the substantive report to be presented at the next session of the Asia-Pacific Forestry Commission early in 1998, material from these working papers will be an important element but will be blended and interpreted alongside a lot of other material.
Working papers are being produced and issued as they arrive. Some effort at uniformity of presentation is being attempted but the contents are only minimally edited for style or clarity. FAO welcomes from readers any information which they feel would be useful to the study on the subject of any of the working papers or on any other subject that has importance for the Asia-Pacific forestry sector.

ABSTRACT
The wood-based panel industry is an important component of the wood processing industry in China which is one of the world's major consumer and importer of forest products. Development of the wood-based panel market in China will not only produce direct impact on the market demand and supply of other forest products in China but also have influence on the pricing trend in the world's wood-based panel market, the plywood market in particular. This study employs groups of data to analyze the status quo of market demand and supply of various wood-based panel products in China in the early 1990s, and applies principles of mathematical statistics to undertake qualitative outlook analysis, quantitative status analysis and simulated projection for the trend of demand and supply in China's wood-based panel market in the coming 15 years (up until 2010). Findings of this study shall not only produce direct guiding significance for the development of China's wood-based panel industry,
have important referential value for China's forestry planning sector to formulate related development plans, but also provide a useful reference material for the relevant international organizations to make analysis and projection of the wood-based panel market and the forest products market in the Asia-Pacific region and the world at large.
Editor's Note
This document is the second of a two-part working paper of which document APFSOS/WP/41(a) is titled "Review of Wood-based Panels Production, Consumption and Trade in the Asia-Pacific Region, 1990 to 2000" by Michael J. Lyons. That companion document covers the whole region, including China.
There are three main points to treat with caution in using this volume focused on China: (a) the abrupt jump in output between 1994 and 1995 reflects a wider range of enterprises included in statistics rather than real increase in output or capacity (see section 3.1); (b) the time series used in the regressions are so short as to be of limited validity for extrapolation; and (c) the historical high dominance of plywood in product mix may be difficult to sustain in future due to raw material constraints. The editor feels that the historical numbers given here are very valuable even if they may be inadequate as a guide to future consumption patterns. (Editor).

1. PREFACE
Along with the development of science and technology, there have been new breakthroughs in timber processing technology and scope of timber utilization. Plywood application is further widened. Particleboard and fibreboard made of branches, twigs, processing residues and other non-wood materials have further raised timber recovery. Wood-based panel production is hence becoming a major component of the wood processing industry.
From both the domestic and international perspectives, the wood-based panel market has always been a major inseparable component of the forest products market. Study, analysis and projected outlook of the development trend of China's wood-based panel market from the past through the present to the future will not only have guiding significance for future production and consumption of wood-based panels in China, but also produce impacts on the world's wood-based panel market and the forest products market at large. Especially, China's production and consumption of plywood will have direct influence on plywood price in the world market.

2.1 Product Classification

2.3 Time Span
2.4 Unit for the Import and Export Volume of the Basic Data
2.5 Unit for the Import and Export Value in the Basic Data
2.6 Trade Volume in Terms of Provinces
2.1 Product Classification
For the purpose of this study, wood-based panel refers to the plain panel. The laminated or otherwise treated wood-based panels fall under the category of secondary processed (or downstream) products which are beyond the scope of this study.
By and large, wood-based panels are subdivided into three main categories, i.e.: plywood, particleboard and fibreboard. Veneer is also considered overseas as a wood-based panel. However, veneer, particularly rotary veneer, is mostly used rather for plywood production than for direct application, and it is in fact a semi-product, being seldom traded as a commodity in the Chinese market. The other type - sliced veneer has a fairly large production with "square meter (m^2)" as the unit, but after conversion into "cubic meters (m^3)" (which is practically unlikely due to enormous variation in thickness), the absolute value is not large at all. In this connection, this study will not deal in depth with production and actual need of veneer consumption. As a matter of fact, the magnitude of veneer production has no direct influence on the production and consumption of plywood as veneer is a semi-product in China.
For the purpose of this study, plywood refers to plywood itself in general. There is no doubt that plywood can be subdivided into general plywood, special purpose plywood (e.g.: aviation plywood, shipping plywood) and bamboo plywood. However, production and consumption of general plywood account for 90% of China's total which is the case in other parts of the world. This explains why the present study does not have subdivision of plywood.
For the purpose of this study, particleboard refers to particleboard itself in general. Particleboard (including woody particleboard and non-wood particleboard) can also be subdivided into general particleboard, oriented structural board (OSB), waferboard, cement (or gypsum)-bonded particleboard, special purpose particleboard, etc. In China, output of general particleboard accounts for 95% of the total particleboard production, waferboard production is almost nil, and there are a few OSB lines in the country but with small capacity due to the limited scope of application. It is worth mentioning that OSB is a major type of particleboard overseas, but not in China.
This study subdivides fibreboard into medium density fibreboard (MDF) and hardboard, but does not deal with softboard due to small production and limited market occupancy. MDF is further divided into thick (over 11 mm) and thin (below 10 mm) boards in overseas countries, while in China, there is no further division as the thickness of most MDF products are above 12 mm with few thin boards. In this connection, this study categorizes MDF as one independent type of product.
2.2 Sources of Data
2.2.1 Basic Data
2.2.2 Socio-economic Data
2.2.1 Basic Data
All the basic data used in this study (production, volume and value of import/export trade) (see Table 1 and tables 11-24) are from the statistical materials published or formally released by governmental organs, namely: the National Forestry Statistics published by the Chinese Forestry Publishing House (Ministry of Forestry of the People's Republic of China; 1989, 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995) and the Customs Statistics on Volume and Values of Imported and Exported Commodities released by the General Administration of Customs of the People's Republic of China (General Administration of Customs of the People's Republic of China, 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995).
2.2.2 Socio-economic Data
The socio-economic data in this study (see Table 2) for 1995 and 1996 are the actual data released by the State, and those for 2000, 2005 and 2010 are targets set by the State for its social and economic development.
2.3 Time Span
2.3.1 Time Span for Basic Data
2.3.2 Time Span for Outlook and Projection Data
2.3.1 Time Span for Basic Data
2.3.1.1 Time Span for Production
The time span for production is between 1990 and 1995; the 1989 data are used for production projection and 1995 data are used for comparison and adjustment (fibreboard excluded) (for reasons, see 3.1).
2.3.1.2 Time Span for Import and Export
The import and export statistics of China's General Administration of Customs follow the commodity classification methods stipulated in the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System HS of the (International) Customs Cooperation Council. Because this system has been revised after its formulation in 1988 and the classification codes for some commodities have been changed, this study takes 1992 as the starting year of the time span for the import and export of wood-based panels in order to facilitate study, analysis and comparison (commodity classification for 1990 and 1991 is not comparable with the present statistics) (time span started from 1990 for plywood due to the consistent use of "cubic meter (m^3)" as the unit for import and export statistics and the classification methods remain unchanged). Considering the fact that China started import and export statistics by provinces only from 1993, the basic data by provinces started from 1993.
2.3.2 Time Span for Outlook and Projection Data
Between 1996 and 2000, annual projected data is available for both production and consumption (see tables 3-10); beyond 2000, every five years are a time span, however the tables give only data for 1996, 2000, 2005 and 2010.
2.4 Unit for the Import and Export Volume of the Basic Data
2.4.1 Plywood
2.4.2 Veneer
2.4.3 Particleboard, MDF and Hardboard
2.4.1 Plywood
The unit for plywood import and export volume during the statistical period is "m^3" which is consistent with the international norms. Therefore these are actual data.
2.4.2 Veneer
As the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System HS has changed the unit for veneer import and export volume into "Kg" since 1994, the universal conversion method of FAO is adopted in this study, i.e.: 1 m^3 of veneer weighs 750 Kg to facilitate comparison. So the figures for veneer import and export volume since 1994 are data after conversion.
2.4.3 Particleboard, MDF and Hardboard
The original unit for the import and export volume of these three products is Kg. To facilitate comparison, the universal conversion method of FAO is adopted in this study, i.e.: 1 m^3 of particleboard weighs 650 Kg, 1 m^3 of MDF weighs 800 Kg and 1 m^3 of hardboard weighs 950 Kg. Hence, all these figures are data after conversion.
2.5 Unit for the Import and Export Value in the Basic Data
Since the currency clearing unit for China's foreign trade is US Dollar, no conversion is needed for these data. However, as the statistical data released by the Customs before 1994 took US$ 1,000 as the unit (the national grand total is too big), there might be some errors in these data due to "rounding up". Furthermore, it might happen that there is a difference of about US$ 1,000 between the national total and the statistics by province due to the use of "US Dollar" as the unit in provincial statistics. This is a result of "rounding off", not a statistical error.
2.6 Trade Volume in Terms of Provinces
In order to harmonize the data and also in line with international practices, the unit for import and export volume is set as m^3. However, the import or export volume for many provinces is definitely decimals. The principle of "rounding off" is adopted, so there happens the case in which some import or export volume is less than 1 m^3. In order to differentiate then, an astral symbol is adopted to indicate the data of import or export volume which is smaller than 1 m^3.

3. METHODOLOGY
3.1 Statistical Method
3.2 Regression Method for Outlook Projection
3.1 Statistical Method
Before 1995, China's statistics on production of wood-based panels (other forest products and even other industrial products at large) include only the enterprises at and above the township/town level, however the Third National Industrial Survey conducted in 1995 expanded the statistical scope to include village-run enterprises and private villager enterprises with its annual sales income exceeding 1 million RMB yuan. Hence, there is a great (sometimes several times) difference between the 1995 statistics and the statistics before 1994 (inclusive) for the production of forest products (including wood-based panels). This study holds that this is caused by inconsistent statistical methodologies and approaches and that the 1995 statistics best reflects China's actual production of wood-based panels. Therefore, the 1995 statistics shall be regarded as comparison and adjustment values in projection of future production, and the time span for basic data shall move one year
backward during projection which means that the 1989 statistics will also be used for simulated projection. After the law of development (equation of simulated regression) between 1989 and 1994 is discovered through analysis, the projected value for 1995 shall be made available through simulation, and the difference between the projected and the actual values for 1995 shall be basis for projection and adjustment.
3.2 Regression Method for Outlook Projection
In order to carry out scientific and quantitative projection of the trend of development in China's wood-based panel market between 2000 and 2010, this study firstly analyses the actual values for production and consumption between 1989 and 1994 (simulation on consumption starts from 1990 or 1992 due to reasons given in 2.3.1.2) to discover the laws governing growth, then defines adjusted regression values through comparison with the actual values (the more precise values) of 1995, and eventually plots out simulation curve (or rectilinear) equation for future trend of development, from which the outlook projection values to the year 2010 and the possible actual values between 1990 and 1994 (the possible actual values in line with the scope and approaches of the Third National Industrial Survey) could be inferred. The concrete simulated projection method is to determine relevant points in the time and supply/demand coordinate system in light of basic data and computing data
over the years, then to select three possible development curves (rectilinear trend, geometric average trend and exponential curve trend) according to the trend of development to simulate regression equations and calculate its extent of deviation respectively, and finally to simulate the initial regression equation in light of specific conditions (the main evidence is the least extent of deviation, i.e.: the most accurate projection equation, followed by possibilities of future development) (He Guodong et al., 1989).
This study has conducted simulated regression with all the three possible curves and eventually adopts only the rectilinear trend according to the magnitude of deviation and trend of development. The final regression equation is the adjusted regression equation after comparison with the actual accurate data of 1995. The annual projected values of production and consumption to the year 2010 inferred from this equation is in fact based on the precondition that the scale and speed of future national economic and social development is in approximation to those between 1989 and 1994, without consideration of the practical development of some wood-based panel products in China.
However, downward adjustments (excluding MDP) are necessary from the projected values for the period between 2000 and 2010 (i.e.: after the Ninth Five-Year Plan period) calculated with the equation obtained through regression of the data for the period between 1989 and 1994 (about the Eighth Five-Year Plan period) in light of the development plans over the years, in particular the Working Report of the Government and the Outline of the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000) for the National Economic and Social Development and the Long-range Target for the Year 2010 adopted at the National People's Congress, and relevant forestry sectoral development plans (for instance, the annual average growth rate of China's GNP was 12.0% during the Eighth Five-Year Plan (1990-1995) period compared to 8.0% during the Ninth Five-Year Plan period(1996-2000), 10.5% (actual) in 1995, 9.7% (actual) in 1996, 8.0% (planned) by 2000 and only 7.0% (planned) by 2005 and 2010. These are the major measures
taken by the Chinese Government to mitigate inflation by slowing down the pace of economic development and the extent of decrease is far higher than the annual population growth rate (merely around 1.2%)).
Nevertheless, the projected values for MDF are adjusted upward (basically multiplies the difference) in light of the difference between the present production and the production capacity due to the fact that MDF production in previous years did not reflect the actual production capacity (nearly half of it has not been brought into play) and that MDF is a promising product in China.
It is worth mentioning that the scope of adjustment should not be too wide, otherwise it is meaningless to have the quantitative regressive simulation. In addition, another purpose of slight adjustment is to round up the project values.

4. RESULTS
4.1 Plywood
4.2 Veneer
4.3 Particleboard
4.4 Medium Density Fibreboard (MDF)
4.5 Hardboard
4.6 Summary Table
4.1 Plywood
4.1.1 Status Quo in the Early 1990s
4.1.2 Outlook for the Year 2010
Plywood is the most important wood-based panel product in China with its production (large statistical base and high starting point) and pace of development (rapid growth) at the forefront compared to other panel products. China is also a major importer of tropical plywood and demand/supply in China's plywood panel market has direct impact on the world's plywood market.
4.1.1 Status Quo in the Early 1990s
The actual data for China's annual production, consumption, volume and value of import and export of plywood are given in Table 1, 11, 15 and 20. At the national level, the statistical base for plywood production is large and the growth is rapid. Volume of import has been around 1-2 million m^3 primarily from Indonesia followed by Malaysia. China has been a major importer of forest products and it is among the net importing countries with little export which is the case for plywood in particular, the import and export difference has always been several dozen times. At the provincial level, Shandong Province is China's major province for plywood production with an output of 1.5889 million m^3 in 1995 accounting for 20.9% of the country's total of 7.5926 million m^3, followed by Hebei, Jiangsu and Fujian etc. Due to its special location and consumption requirements, Guangdong Province has been China's major importing province of plywood with an import of 1.300906 million m^3
in 1995 or 62.5% of the country's total of 2.082925 million m^3, followed by Shanghai and Fujian etc.
4.1.2 Outlook for the Year 2010
In accordance with the actual data and the approach and process of outlook projection, the regression equation for the trend of development of plywood production between 1989 and 1994 is: y = 472643 + 400003x. "y" stands for production, the unit is m^3, "x" stands for year, and the year 1989 is taken as the base year "0". Its value of deviation is smaller than that concluded from regressions using the geometric average curve and the exponential curve.
The adjusted regression equation after comparison with the 1995 data is: y = 5192582 + 400003x.
The adjusted regression equation for consumption projection concluded by using the same method is y = 5488779 + 676288x. "y" stands for consumption, the unit is m^3, "x" stands for year, and the year 1990 is taken as 1 (in consistence with the assumption that the year 1989 is the base year "0") (for reasons see 2.3.1.2). Its value of deviation is smaller than that concluded from regressions using the geometric average curve and the exponential curve.
Comparison between the actual data of import and export volume of plywood between 1990 and 1995 (see Table 1) reveals that the difference between import and export is as great as several dozen times. The study takes the average of 40 times as the basis for calculation. The formula is:
Volume of import = (consumption - production) × import/export ratio/(import/export ratio-1)
Volume of export = (consumption-production)/(import/export ratio - 1)
With these formula, the outlook projection data (unit: 1,000 m^3) for China's plywood market in 1996, 2000, 2005 and 2010 are calculated (and adjusted accordingly) as follows:
Year
Consumption
Production
Import Volume
Export Volume
The specific outlook projection process, regression parameters, value of deviation, and projection tables and maps for production and consumption are given in tables 3 and 4.
4.2 Veneer
As mentioned above, veneers are semi-products in China mainly for plywood production (excluding sliced veneer), there is no production statistics and little trade in the market, therefore, it is neither possible nor meaningful to make projections on future production. However, it must be noted that China will be one of the major potential importing countries of veneer products (rotary veneer in particular). The reason underlining this is that China is short of forest resources, especially large diameter timber resources for plywood production, and that some tropical timber exporting countries are further reducing export of logs to promote their domestic greater value added wood processing industries (it is more beneficial to export veneer rather than logs), large veneer import for surface board of plywood (the core board can be produced from domestic timber) to improve plywood quality at reasonable cost is a very practical strategy for plywood development in China. As a
matter of fact, this trend is becoming more and more obvious. On this basis and in light of the veneer import and export ratio (about 10 times, see tables 1,16 and 21) over the years, this study makes the following outlook projection on China's import and export volume of veneer products (unit: 1,000 m^3):
Year
Import Volume
Export Volume
4.3 Particleboard
4.3.1 Status Quo in the Early 1990s
4.3.2 Outlook for the Year 2010
Particleboard is also one of the major wood-based panel products in China. Although rapid development of the particleboard industry is restricted to certain extent by such problems as poor product quality and abnormal production in some enterprises due to shortage of raw materials and techniques, the industry is still developing fairly rapidly. By now, there are two particleboard plants in China with an annual productive capacity of 100,000 m^3 and 80,000 m^3 respectively and 8 lines with an annual productive capacity of 50,000 m^3 each. Most of the equipment for the particleboard lines with an annual productive capacity of over 50,000 m^3 were imported from Germany (Bison Company, Siempelkamp Company and Schenck Panel Production System GmbH) and the production capacity of domestically made equipment can reach only 30,000 m^3.
4.3.1 Status Quo in the Early 1990s
The actual data for China's annual production, consumption, volume and value of import and export of particleboard are given in Table 1,12,17 and 22. At the national level, the statistical base for particleboard production is not as large as that of plywood with relatively slow growth. Its import and export trade is far behind plywood with a stable and descending trend in recent years. At the provincial level, Shandong Province is also China's major province for particleboard production with an output of 1.1562 million m^3 or 26.6% of the country's total of 4.351 million m^3, followed by Jiangsu and Heilongjiang provinces etc.
4.3.2 Outlook for the Year 2010
With the same methods and procedures for plywood, the adjusted regression equation of outlook projection on particleboard production is: y = 2606782 + 290703x. "y" stands for production, the unit is m^3, "x" stands for year, and the year 1989 is set as the base year "0". Its value of deviation is much smaller than that concluded from regressions using the geometric average curve and the exponential curve.
Similarly, the adjusted regression equation for outlook projection on particleboard consumption is: y = 2698565 + 283220x. "y" stands for consumption, the unit is m^3, "x" stands for year, and the year 1992 is set as "3" (in consistence with the assumption that the year 1989 is the base year "0"). (for reasons see 2.3.1.2). Its value of deviation is much smaller than that concluded from regressions using the geometric average curve and the exponential curve.
The projected outlook data for particleboard import and export can be calculated based on that the average ratio between export and import over the year is 1:10.
Hence, the projected outlook data (unit: 1,000 m^3) for China's particleboard market in 1996, 2000, 2005 and 2010 are calculated (and adjusted accordingly) as follows:
Year
Consumption
Production
Import Volume
Export Volume
The specific outlook projection process, regression parameters, value of deviation, and projection tables and maps for production and consumption are given in tables 5 and 6.
4.4 Medium Density Fibreboard (MDF)
4.4.1 Status Quo in the Early 1990s
4.4.2 Outlook for the Year 2010
4.4.1 Status Quo in the Early 1990s
Due to the advantages of low density, good processing characteristics and sound properties, MDF production has developed very rapidly in China. There was a "hot" period for MDF products in China in the early 1990s. Nevertheless, the current MDF production is not high (even in 1995) and the productive capacity of most MDF lines has not brought into full play due to various reasons (for instance, some production lines import the key machines and use domestic equipment for other sections of the line which results in problems in matching up the imported and domestic equipment, particularly for the automatic controlling system). Statistics show that there were nearly 40 MDF plants in China in 1995, of which there was only one plant with an annual productive capacity of 100,000 m^3, two plants 50,000 m^3, 11 plants 30,000 m^3, and most of the remaining plants around 15,000-20,000 m^3. Most of the equipment in the production lines with an productive capacity of over 30,000 m^3 were
imported from overseas with one exception only which uses domestic machines to produce 30,000 m^3 of MDF products.
China's total MDF productive capacity exceeded 1 million m^3 in 1995 whereas production was merely 536,900 m^3, only about half of the productive capacity (roughly the same in 1993 and 1994). As far as import and export are concerned, volume of import in 1995 was merely 31,800 m^3, and volume of export was 6,746 m^3. This is because of the fact that, at the global scale, the scale of development for MDF is lagging far behind that for particleboard with little trade activities. The actual data related to the annual production, consumption, volume and value of import and export for MDF between 1990 and 1995 are given in Tables 1,13,18 and 23. From the provincial viewpoint, Guangdong Province is China's major province for MDF production with an output of 143,500 m^3 in 1995 accounting for 26.7% of the country's total of 536,900 m^3.
4.4.2 Outlook for the Year 2010
As described above, half of the MDF productive capacity in China has not been brought into full play. However, along with the settlement of the technological queries and standardization of market mechanism, this problem is expected to be solved by the early 21 century. In this connection, this study has enlarged the projected values year after year between 1996 and 1999 in regression equations for production and consumption, and after the year 2000, the enlargement is almost doubled to show the upward-adjusted projection values for MDF.
The initial projected production equation is: y = -18257 + 90636x. "y" stands for production, the unit is m^3, "x" stands for year, and the year 1990 is set as "1" (in consistence with the assumption that the year 1989 is the base year "0") (the simulated regression uses the 1995 production data instead of those in 1989).
Similarly, the initial projected consumption equation is: y = 24181 + 77937x. "y" stands for production, the unit is m^3, "x" stands for year, and the year 1992 is set as "3" (in consistence with the assumption that the year 1989 is the base year "0") (for reasons see 2.3.1.2).
The projected outlook data for MDF import and export can be calculated based on that the average ratio between export and import is over the years is 3:1.
Hence, the outlook projected data (unit: 1,000 m^3) for China's MDF market in 1996, 2000, 2005 and 2010 are calculated (and adjusted accordingly) as follows:
Year
Consumption
Production
Import Volume
Export Volume
The specific outlook projection process, regression parameters, value of deviation, and projection tables and maps for production and consumption are given in tables 7 and 8.
4.5 Hardboard
4.5.1 Status Quo in the Early 1990s
4.5.2 Outlook for the Year 2010
4.5.1 Status Quo in the Early 1990s
The actual data for China's annual production, consumption, volume and value of import and export of hardboard are given in tables 1,14,19 and 24.
As a traditional wood-based panel product, hardboard witnessed rapid development in the 1960s and the early 1970s. However, rapid development of particleboard since the late 1970s, particularly from the 1980s, has slowed down to some extent hardboard development.
