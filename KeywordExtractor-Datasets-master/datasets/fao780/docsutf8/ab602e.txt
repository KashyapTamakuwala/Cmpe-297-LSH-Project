METHODOLOGY.
Pine Volumetric Growth.
To determine the volumetric growth of pinus radiata have been used two methods: a) Logistic Function of the Pine Volumetric Growth.
We have determined a Logistic Function of the Pine Volumetric growth in according to the record given by the INFOR. In this relationship are considered: volume and age. The function is the following: with an adjusted R - squared of 0.9969. f(t) = 4.970525t + 2.188126t2 - 0.044910t3.
Logistic Shape Radiata Pine.
Relationship beteween standing volume per hectare (net of defect) and age.
Function linear : 25 m3/ha/year.
This yield corresponds to the Annual Medium Increase used by the INFOR to determine the volume by hectare and by age. 2.2 Eucalyptus Volumetric Growth.
It has been used the Annual Medium Increase applied by the INFOR and corresponds to 22 m3/ha/year. It has not been possible to estimate a function growth logistics by lack of information.
4 2.3 Rotation Period.
To determine the rotation period the following criteria have been used. a) Technically Optimal Rotation Period.
The equilibrium condition is: f'(t) = f(t)/t Result: 24 years old b) Economical Solution of Faustmann-Pressler -Ohlin (Infinite Plantation Cycles).
Max VAN = Pf (t )e - rt - K - R e - rt dt.
dVAN = Pf ' (t ) - rPf (t ) - R = 0 dt V= R r.
The equilibrium condition is:.
Pf ' (t ) = r [Pf (t ) + V ].
V = 800 US$/ha (estimated figure by the INFOR for forest land exclusively) Legend r : interest rate K: regeneration cost R: land rent Result: 18 years old c) Rotation Age of Major Frequency Registered in Chile for Pinus Radiata.
According to the record given by the INFOR the rotation age of major frequency registered in Chile is of 20 years. This period was used to determine the appreciation not only in the logistic function of the pine volumetric growth, but also in the linear function. d) Rotation Age of Major Frequency Registered in Chile for Eucalyptus.
According to the record given by the INFOR the rotation age of major frequency registered in Chile for the eucalyptus is of 12 years. This period was used to determine the appreciation as a linear growth function (264 m3/ha). 2.4 Calculus of the Appreciation of the Forestry Asset.
The calculus formuli to determine the appreciation of the forestry asset have been suggested by Michael Linddal.1.
5 The appendix shows assess the asset value and appreciation of a perpetual forest rotation with regeneration costs (Co), rotation age (T), interest rate (r), volume harvested (q(T)), and flat rate current resource rents of timber price (p) less extraction costs (c). Continuous discounting is assumed: (1+r)-rt  e-rt. Every rotation has prior to the establishment (planting) a net present value of R (equation 1). For perpetual forest rotation the net present value is an annuity of a payment R every T year. This is equal to the land value for forest S(T) (equation 2). After planting the establishment costs are sunk cost. The asset value of a forest of age t is equal to the value of the harvest in (T-t) years and the value of forest land thereafter. The asset value is known as the soil expectation value SEV(t) (equation 3). The appreciation from year t to year t+1 (D(t)) is the difference in the asset value (equation 4). Equation 1: Value of one rotation Equation 2: Value of forest land Equation 3: Soil expectation value Equation 4: Appreciation R = H(T) * e-rT ­ Co S(T) = R / (1- e-rT) SEV(t) = [ S(T) + H(T) ] * e-r (T-t) D(t) = SEV(t+1) ­ SEV(t) = SEV(t+1/2)*r.
For land coming into forest either as replanted or afforestation the asset value in t=0 is SEV(0)=[S(T) + H(T)] * e-rT because the regeneration costs are sunk. The asset value for t=T is SEV(T) = S(T) + H(T) just before harvest (sum of stumpage and land value) and S(T) just after harvest (land value only) but before replanting. For forest stands not harvested in year T or with a stand age above T it is assumed that the asset value is H(T) + S(T), i.e. there is neither an appreciation due to growth or a depreciation due to over maturity of the timber. Legend: R = net present value of one forest rotation t = stand age T = rotation age r = interest rate Co = regeneration cost H(T) = harvest value at rotation age S(T) = land value for forest at rotation age T SEV(T) = soil expectation value (asset value) D(t) = appreciation of asset value from t to t+1.

Other Premises and Assumptions In order to carry out the calculations the following premises and assumptions were taken in consideration: a) b) c) The costs of exploitation of an hectare of Pinus radiata stays constant during all the period of analysis. It was estimated for 24, 20 and 18 years.(See Table 5) The price on site of a cubic meter of Pinus radiata wood equal to 25 US$/ m3.. It was valued constant for all of the period of analysis. (See Table 4) The real utilized annual interest rate (r) is 7.97%, which is close to the interest rates that the managers of the forestry industry use when they borrow money for the long term. For its calculation, it was deflected 6.6%, the appraisal of inflation corresponding to the year 1996. The nominal annual interest rate of 8.5% for the long term credits. The real interest rate stays constant during all the period of analysis. All the calculations have been carried out in dollars of 1996. The average type of change corresponding to that year was of 1US$= $Ch 396.773. Source: Central Bank of Chile. Monthly Bulletin N° 8733, July 1997.
13 e) The information registered by INFOR on the Inventory of Plantations of Pinus radiata is complete- by age range- for the years 1985 to 1996. However, it was necessary estimate the information for the day of plantations of the year 1985, 1986 and 1987, which according to the statistics, should be included in the range of age 1 ­ 5 years. That is why, to determine the right numbers for each age, every range was divided by.
In all cases, the figures are nets of forest fires and plagues. The coefficient's estimate of the losses for plagues, illness and blazes for the Pinus radiata, already applied by INFOR in their statistics, are contained in the Introduction of the Environmental Accounting in the National Bills of the Central Bank of Chile Project. Investigation financed by the Central Bank of Chile and executed by the Forest Institute in collaboration with the Department of Agrarian Economy of the Catholic University of Chile. 1996. To verify the consistency of the figures given by INFOR, a follow-up of the plantations between 1955 and 1996 was done to determine the planted surface by age without taking into account the losses by fire, plagues and harvest. These figures compared to the registered by INFOR are consistent in spite of the fact that they present with a range of 5 years. The principal destinations of the Pinus radiata harvest are saw logs (80%) and pulp wood (20%). The registrations of current demand shows a preferential behaviour for pulp wood products over saw wood products. It is estimated that 96% of the net production coming of the Eucalyptus sp. forests, including thinning, is oriented towards pulp or derived products. Utilized Information. Explanatory Notes.
Following is the detailed information that was utilized in order to calculate the Appreciation of the Forest Resource Pinus radiata. 3.3.1 Planted surface of pinus radiata for age.
The planted surface of Pinus radiata for age for the period 1985 ­ 1996 has been obtained from the official figures published by the Chilean Forest Institute (INFOR). These figures are nets of harvests and losses from forest fires and plagues. The utilized information presents the forest hectares assembled in categories of age, with ranges of 5 years. To estimate the corresponding hectares for each age class, a simple average for range of age was calculated. The basic information is presented in Table.
The harvested hectares in each year were added, before the nets of harvest and of plagues and fires, to determine the hectares of standing crop. A special calculation for the age 0 has been carried out for the years 1985, 1986 and 1987. The plantations of age 0, according to the official figures of INFOR, are included in the range of ages 1-5 years. To get them, the standard of survival which is equivalent to an average of 75%, was applied to the net plantation figures; getting this way the net plantations for the year 0, which are at the same time, subtracted of the range of ages 1-5 years.

The official figures of INFOR, for these 3 years, corresponding to the range of ages 1-5, include the plantations of age.
It has been necessary to separate the figures for each range of age, taking on that only 75% of the plantations of the year 0 survived. Figure 3 Planted Surface of Pinus Radiata (Hectares).

In the projection, a volumetric growth equal to 25 m3/ha/year is supposed, and corresponds to the pondered average calculated for the country. In Chile, Pinus radiata grows in an extension of more than 1,000 kilometers of surface.
15 In order to determine the rhythm of the volumetric growth of Pinus radiata, in annual m3 per hectare, the following variables are considered : Zones of mayor concentration of plantations, site index2 and site class. 3.3.2 Prices.
In order to calculate the Actual Value of the Pinus radiata forest resource, the on the site costs of wood was utilized. This, to their time, was determined from the costs of wood put in factory, to who the expenses for concept of discharge and patio, transport from the forest until the plant and hauling were discounted.

In order to carry out the calculations the following premises and assumptions were taken in consideration : a) b) c) The costs of exploitation of an hectare of Eucalyptus sp stays constant during all the period of analysis. It was estimated to be 16.23 US$ / m3. (See Table 9) The price on site of a cubic meter of Eucalyptus sp. wood equal to 39 US$/ m3 was valued constant for all of the period of analysis. (See Table 8) The real utilized annual interest rate (r) is 7.97%. And it belongs to a nominal annual interest rate of 8.5% for the long term credits. To deflect, a 6.6% appraisal of inflation corresponding to the year 1996 was applied. The real interest rate stays constant during all the period of analysis. All the calculations have been carried out in dollars of 1996. The average type of change corresponding to that year was of 1US$= $Ch 396.773. Source: Central Bank of Chile. Monthly Bulletin N° 8733, July 1997. The produced volume at the end of the 12 years has been valued in 264m3 / ha. In this calculation all the trees of same age (which are the majority) or superior to 12 years (mature trees that have not been harvested in the previous years) are considered. For the last ones, the output stays on 264 m3/ha. These calculations are produced from the Annual Medium Increment, that in case of the Eucalyptus sp. is 22 m3/ ha/ year.

20 f) The information registered by INFOR on the Inventory of Plantations of Eucalyptus sp. is complete- by age range- only for the years 1995 and 1996. However, for the years 1985 to 1994 only exists global information. Consequently, in order to carry out the required calculations presently reported, this global information by ages has been distributed, applying an average percentage distribution (% T) produced during the years 1995 and 1996. The principal destination of the Eucalyptus sp. harvest is pulp. The registrations of current demand shows a preferential behaviour for pulp wood products over saw wood products. It is estimated that 96% of the net production coming of the Eucalyptus sp. forests, including thinnings, are oriented towards pulp or derived products. In all cases, the figures are nets of forest fires and plagues. The coefficient's estimate of the losses for plagues, illness and blazes for the Eucalyptus sp., already applied by INFOR in their statistics, are contained in the Introduction of the Environmental Accounting in the National Bills of the Central Bank of Chile Project.

Cost of Establishment. The cost of establishment varies according to the initial considerate density and includes the following tasks: Underbrush clearance, burning, fencing, soil preparation, fire prevention, plantation, control of overgrowths and/ or rodents and fertilization. The initial value of the establishment of the plantation in the year zero, according to INFOR, is of 524 US$/ ha. Cost of Harvest. It includes: Cutting, logging and encampment installation. The utilized cost of harvest is 1,848 (US$/ ha) and you/he/she/it return 7 US$/ m3. Applying an output of 264 m3/ha. Fire Control Maintenance. The annual cost is of 19 US$/ ha/ year. the Future Value of this annuality was calculated, for a period of 12 years and to an annual interest rate of the 7.97%. So the result is of 359.92 US$/ha and it is equivalent to 1.36 US$/ m3. Administration and Protection Includes : Surveillance, supervision, minor maintenance, insurance against fire and disasters, plague control labors, and fire fighting. The cost of Administration and Protection are, according to INFOR, of 12.4 US$/ha/year. the Future Value of this annuality was calculated for a period of 12 years to an interest rate of the 7.97%. The result is of 234.9 US$/ha and equals to 0.89 US$/ m3.
ANTECEDENTS OF THE CHILEAN FOREST SECTOR.
Introduction.
Chile has 75.4 million hectares of continental LAND. The forests cover 15,647,894 hectares, which represents 20.8% of the national territory. 32.5% of the territory are deserts (naked areas) and 27.2% are covered with prairies and brushes. The current land use is detailed in the following board: Table 10 Current Land Use Hectares 181,420 3,805,784 20,506,615 15,647,894 4,496,071 24,529,190 4,641,730 1,211,579 388,753 75,409,035 % 0.2 5.0 27.2 20.8 6.0 32.5 6.2 1.6 0.5 100.0.

The native forest reaches to 13,443,316 hectares, which represents the 17.8% of the national surface. The most abundant forest is the adult, and represents 38.2% of the forest surface. According to this Inventory, the Forest Plantations are of 2,118,836 hectares which equal 13.5% of the forests and 2.8% of the national surface. These figures on plantations are 282,851 hectares over the ones registered by INFOR. In this inventory, in order to get the graphic information around 47,000 air photographs and 35 satellite photographs (for the covered zones to scale 1: 250.000) were interpreted. This practically covered the entirety of the national territory, with exception of the oceanic islands and the Antarctic territory. Only 0.5% of the continental land could not be covered with this type of image. The inventory also has all the information obtained directly on the site, in three years of work, with more than 3,600 journeys in the field. This newly information of January 1998, suggest that the realized calculations over plantations, in this report, would be relatively overvalued. However, it does not subtract value to the conclusions in relation of the evolution of the Appreciation of the Natural Capital. The forests plantations, according to INFOR and their projections, for the year 1996 covers 1,835,985 hectares. From this total, 1,387,041 ha are of Pinus radiata (75.6%); 308,762 ha of Eucalyptus sp. (16.8%) and the remainder of Other Species (7.6%).
26 5.2 Development of the Chilean Forestry Sector.
The development of the Chilean forest is essentially based in the exploitation of the Pinus radiata. Original of the peninsula of Monterrey, the specie was introduced in Chile some 100 years ago, where, due to the special climatic and soil conditions, it grows to very superior rate to than in its place of origin. This development has wakened up many interest in the informed circles of the forest industry of the world. Its bases are found in two big landmarks intimately related: a) b) A model of economical development open to the international market: Opening to the worldwide market and deregulating the economy. A model of forest development based on plantations: For over than four decades the diverse governments have affected directly or indirectly in the forestation and reforestation of the country by means of direct incentives - payment on behalf of the cost of planting and managing - and indirect ­ tributary profit and other tools of economic politics - to the forests plantations.
The outputs of this forest politics, expressed essentially in the Ordinance Law 701 of 19744, of incentive to the development of the private plantations, was expressed in an extraordinary growth of the species Pinus radiata d. Don, capable of supplying the primary forest industry and generate 85% of the production value, harvesting it annually more than 18 million m3. Besides creating a net value of primary production equivalent to 2,400 million dollars, of which 63% constitute the export offer of forests products of the most diverse nature, from saw wood to furniture and products added value. The market for the forester is transparent, in the sense that relies on an information of wellknown costs, with different barriers and power of negotiation, opposite the old industry. Consequently, the variables of offer and demand reflects, given the liberty of export, the international costs for logs. In the recent trajectory of the forest sector, one could mention that the country in the decade of the 70's and 80's was a wood producer, leader in the low cost production and which offered to the industry or to the external market, costs comparatively lower than those of the countries with more forest development. This situation changes starting from the 90's, almost duplicating the real costs for the local industry, small and medium companies with obsolescent technology didn't succeed in offering products of a good relationship price -quality to the market, since their costs of supply were too high without getting the margins in order to sustain the sawing business because of the low output that they where getting from the prime material. The anterior is produced by the setting in progress of numerous projects of great size, especially in the area of the mechanical remake of wood, adding to this problem the effect of the boost of internal productive costs next to a strong lowering off the currency exchange rate5. The expectations of costs for the forester improved substantially. The trajectory that the real cost followed was reflected perfectly in the cost of purchase of the countries with high forest development. The previously commented meant a stimulus so that the forester (re forester) enters to the business of forest plantations.
27 However, Chile has come losing its comparative advantages, between other causes, for the mentioned overprice of its productive factors. This new situation is obligating that the previously commented model enters in a phase of strategic change in order to establish new competitive advantages and elevate the development curve through technological innovation. On the other hand, it is an important precedent that the property of the forests and the forest lands ­ native or plantations - are, in their majority, of private property. The State is proprietor of 14 million hectares that are under the SNASPE6 (13% are natural forests and the remainder are deserts, steppes, glacial and high mountain. The State also has 1.8 million hectares not belonging to the SNASPE, which are distributed in areas of protection, sanctuaries of nature, genetic reservations and places of scientific interest. As for artificial plantations, the State now possesses some 42 thousand hectares of Pinus radiata that is administered by the National Forest Corporation (CONAF) in agreement with particulars. 5.3 Reforestation and Forestation.
Reforestation is the plantation on the harvested of a forest. The regulations demand that all harvested forest be replanted in the term of 3 years. For their part, forestation refers to the plantation carried out in lands that didn't have forests and they were dedicated to other uses. The surface forested and reforested with the species Pinus radiata and "other species"7 for the period 1978-1996 are shown in the following table: Table 11 Reforestation and Forestation According to Year. 1978 - 1996 (In Hectares) TOTAL (1) PINUS RADIATA OTHER ESPECIES (%) ( %) 77,371,0 65,413,0 84.5 11,958,0 15.5 72,164,0 60,086,0 83.3 12,078,0 16.7 96,278,0 80,630,0 83.7 15,648,0 16.3 94,130,0 61,310,0 65.1 32,820,0 34.8 117,442,0 75,416,0 64.2 42,026,0 35.8 130,429,0 81,868,0 62.8 48,561,0 37.2 124,704,0 71,411,0 57.3 53,293,0 42.7 109,885,0 63,061,0 57.4 46,824,0 42.6 99,857,0 62,723,0 62.8 37,134,0 37.2 78,592,7 53,444,0 68.0 25,148,8 32.0.

28 5.4 Plantations of Exotic Species.
The plantation of exotic species, initiate more than six decades, have had a sustained growth through time, which has permitted that in the year 1996 registers a total of 1.8 million hectares, of the whom, 75.9% are Pinus radiata; 16.6% are Eucalyptus sp., and the remainder to other exotic species like Atriplex sp., Prosopis tamarugo, Pseudotsuga sp. and Populus sp.

It comes off of the table that the two principal species, Pinus radiata and Eucalyptus sp,, represent 92.5% of the total plantations, 5.5 Plantations of Pinus Radiata.
The plantations of Pinus radiata constitutes the industrial base of the Chilean forestry sector, since they offer qualities that allow to destine them to a great variety of uses. In fact, only representing 18.4% of the surface of productive forests, contribute 74.5% of the prime industrial material, in 1996 the consumption was of 22.9 million m3 s.s.c8. The planted surface and the equivalent volume of Pinus radiata, by region, in the year 1996 is the following:.
