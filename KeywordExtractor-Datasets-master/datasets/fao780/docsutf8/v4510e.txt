<title>Post-harvest deterioration of cassava - A biotechnology perspective</title>
<section>1</section>
Foreword
This document is a report on the proceedings of an Expert Consultation on Biodeterioration of Cassava held at FAO Headquarters, Rome from 11 to 13 December 1991. The meeting was sponsored by FAO and cosponsored by the Rockefeller Foundation. It provided a forum for scientists to review the biochemistry associated with post-harvest deterioration of the cassava crop and to explore the possibility of applying modern molecular biology to develop varieties with superior storability.
Cassava is a major subsistence crop for over 500 million people in developing countries. However, the rapid deterioration of fresh cassava roots after harvest is a severe problem to producers, consumers and marketers irrespective of the scale of operation. The roots begin to deteriorate as quickly as 24 hours after harvest and most cultivars deteriorate within two to three days. This situation is due to physiological deterioration which leads to substantial quantitative and qualitative post-harvest losses of the roots causing high production, processing and marketing risks.
Current post-harvest management practices used to extend the storage life of cassava roots were reviewed and were considered either technically or economically unsuitable for most marketing needs. Although the mechanism involved in post-harvest deterioration has yet to be adequately elucidated, it was felt that the problem could be resolved considering that, when the crop is left unharvested, the roots could be "stored" on the plant successfully without deterioration for over one year.
The genetic variability for post-harvest deterioration was reviewed and it was found that the evaluation method used was considered insufficiently precise to critically assess the trait. It was considered necessary to define and develop a screening assay to quantify post-harvest physiological deterioration in the available germplasm collection to determine genetic variability and stability.
Conventional breeding was considered as a possibility using recurrent selection methods. However, tremendous efforts would be required for incorporating the trait into different cultivars without altering the characteristics of the parent genotypes.
Genetic manipulation using molecular techniques was considered most appropriate in resolving the problem. Nevertheless, there is no information available on genes involved in the biochemical pathways that are associated with physiological deterioration in cassava. However, because of their implication in the process of post-harvest deterioration, the genes and gene products associated with the synthesis and degradation of phenylpropanoids were considered principal targets for study and manipulation.
Many of the phenylpropanoids associated with wound-induced responses have been isolated and characterized from various plants. These genes could be used to isolate the corresponding genes from cassava. These studies could then provide an insight into the deterioration process and would assist in developing strategies for genetic manipulation approaches. The introduction into cassava of discrete gene constructs by genetic manipulation offers the unique advantage of adding new traits to elite genotypes without altering other desired characteristics. It was envisaged that FAO would collaborate with appropriate institutions to facilitate a comprehensive initiative in this research area.
FAO considers that the review process and interpretation on the problem of post-harvest deterioration of cassava by the experts at the consultation merits publication as a proceedings in that it is the only document that deals with an indepth analysis of this important area.

Welcome address
Dr. Papasolomontos, Director, AGP, participants, ladies and gentlemen, it is indeed an honour and my distinct pleasure to welcome you on behalf of the Director-General of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and to extend my most sincere and warm wishes for the success of this workshop on post-harvest biodeterioration of cassava.
In the area of root crop improvement, this meeting is a very important one. It is intended to provide a forum for you as scientists to discuss what is known about the rapid post-harvest deterioration of cassava and to develop an appropriate strategy to overcome this severe problem which limits the expansion of cassava production in developing countries.
As you are aware, root and tuber crops are of vital importance to the food security of over one billion people in developing countries. The important role of these crops was underscored by our Director-General at the Eleventh Session of the Committee on World Food Security in 1986 and the Ninth and Tenth Sessions of FAO's Committee on Agriculture (COAG) in 1987 and 1 989 respectively.
FAO's activities on root crops and other food staples are conducted on a multidisciplinary basis involving several FAO services in allied fields in plant breeding, production, protection, post-harvest physiology, storage, processing, marketing, extension, socio-economics (the role of women), etc.
The work programme is research and development oriented and renders assistance to developing countries in the promotion of regional networks aimed at:
o the collation, exchange and dissemination of information on improved cultivation techniques to increase production per unit area, optimize economic return to farm families and users, maximize poverty alleviation and enhance food availability;
o establishing greater technical cooperation with international agricultural research centres (CIP, CIAT and IITA) along with other national, international and regional institutions in the initiation of complementary activities in technology transfer to national programmes developing countries.
In the field programme, special assistance has been given to Member Countries in the implementation of project activities to improve production, post-harvest handling, utilization and marketing within the context of sustainable cropping systems and principally through support to technology transfer, so as to reduce dependence on food imports and trade deficit and to enhance the socio-economic welfare of small farmers.
Of the tropical root crops, cassava is one of the most important food staples in the lowland tropics' and comprises over 50 percent of the total production of root crops. World cassava production in 1991 is estimated at 161.5 million tonnes, some 3 percent more than last year, as a result of increases in nearly all producing countries.
In Africa, cassava production has expanded by 2 percent, the equivalent of 75 million tonnes. This increase was due to favourable weather conditions, the diffusion of new high-yielding varieties and the continuation of restrictive government import policies on cereals in most countries. The improved cassava supply in 1991 is estimated to have contributed significantly to the increase in food availability in Africa, particularly in rural areas. It has also helped to alleviate shortages of cereals in many countries.
In Latin America and the Caribbean, production has increased by 4 percent, the equivalent to 33 million tonnes. The increase in the region's cassava output reflects the development of new varieties and processing technologies, but also changes in government policies, which have favoured an increased demand for cassava products in both food and other uses. Although cassava continues to be an important food security subsistence crop, particularly in the northern parts of Brazil, the Dominican Republic and Haiti, the development of new processed products over the last decade is resulting in increased market production for food, feed and industrial uses.
In Asia. the production increase is over 4 percent (53 million tonnes) compared to 1990, reflecting mainly a recovery in Indonesia stimulated by relatively high producer prices. In Thailand, the EU-financed programme to divert land under cassava to alternative crops, such as rubber and fruit trees, entered its second phase last year. However, little success has been achieved as cassava continues to be relatively more profitable than other crops to farmers.
There is a large potential for creating higher yielding cultivars with improved storability through proper screening, breeding and selection procedures. For example, IITA has recently been developing, through polyploid breeding, cultivars with multiple pest and disease resistance and with higher nutritive value and consumers' acceptance. Before these improved cultivate could be extended to farmers' fields, it would be necessary to establish plant propagation tenures for the maintenance, rapid increase and distribution of healthy and improved planting material. This would help a great deal to correct the present situation in which farmers save their own planting material, which from year to year suffers severe deterioration due to the accumulation of viruses and other diseases. It would be necessary to assist Member Countries in the identification of improved cultivars adapted to different agro-ecological regions where good yield potential can be achieved. The importance of
implementing programmes for integrated pest and disease control cannot be overemphasized.
One of the major limitations on the expansion of the role of cassava as a food resource of the tropics is the poor post-harvest storage life of the roots, which can only be successfully stored for 48 to 72 hours after harvest. This impediment renders the roots unacceptable for both human and animal consumption and also for industrial uses.
This workshop is intended to address this constraint to cassava production and utilization. However, more long-term donor assistance, for both recurrent and capital expenditure, will be required to support more research and development programmes directed to farmers' needs. International agricultural research centres and other agencies may need to establish more integrated activities to support national cassava research programmes in overcoming the major production and utilization constraints, such as biodeterioration. This approach will enable developing countries to achieve greater food self-sufficiency and security. However, a firm commitment and dedication of policy-makers in governments would be required to support such a programme to reduce postharvest deterioration in this crop.
I should like to express my appreciation to all participants who have volunteered to attend this very important workshop to develop sound scientific strategies to overcome this major constraint which limits the expansion of cassava production in tropical countries.
In closing, I should like to extend my warm welcome and wish you every success with your deliberations.

Introduction
Cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) is a perennial vegetatively propagated shrub that is grown throughout the lowland tropics (Figures I and 2). Cassava appears to be one of the earliest crops to have been domesticated and was widespread throughout the New World tropics by the late fifteenth century. Introduction to Africa occurred in the late sixteenth century (Jones, 1959) and to Asia probably not until the eighteenth century. Typically the crop is grown between 30° north and 30° south of the equator, in areas where the annual mean temperature is greater than 18 to 20°C. Cassava, which is believed to have originated in Latin America, has a number of attributes that have made it an attractive crop for small farmers with limited resources in marginal agricultural areas:
o it is one of the most efficient carbohydrate-producing crops;
o it is tolerant of low soil fertility and drought;
o it has the ability to recover from the damage caused by most pests and diseases;
o the roots can be left in the ground for long periods as a food reserve and, thus, provide an insurance against famine;
o the crop is well adapted to traditional mixed cropping agricultural systems and subsistence cultivation in which farmers seek to minimize the risk of total crop failure.
In the tropics, cassava is the most important root crop and as a source of calories for human consumption it ranks fourth after rice, sugar cane and maize. It is a major carbohydrate food for an estimated 500 million people and in tropical Africa it is the single most important source of calories in the diet (CIAT, 1992). The roots are the principle edible portion of the plant and typical ranges of composition given are; water 62 to 65 percent, total carbohydrate 32 to 35 percent, protein 0.7 to 2.6 percent, fat 0.2 to 0.5 percent, fibre 0.8 to 1.3 percent and ash 0.3 to 1.3 percent (Kay, 1987). In nutritional terms, cassava is considered primarily as a source of carbohydrate energy, most of which is derived from starch.
Total world production has increased from 70 million tonnes in 1960 to an estimated 150 million tonnes in 1990 (Table 1). Of this total, 43 percent is produced in Africa, 35 percent in Asia and 22 percent in Latin America. In the Americas during the 1970s and early 1980s there was a decreasing trend in cassava production which, since the late 1980s, has gradually changed into one of slow growth. During the period from 1985 to 1990 cassava production increased by 9.6 percent, from 29.6 million tonnes to 33.7 million tonnes (FAO Yearbooks). Brazil, Paraguay and Colombia, which together represent 92 percent of total cassava production on the continent, have all experienced growth in production.
Cassava production in Asia has risen, almost 1.5 percent above the annual population growth rate, from 48.5 million tonnes in 1985 to 52.0 million tonnes in 1990. The two major Asian cassava-growing countries, Thailand and Indonesia, have shown the largest increases in production. The Thai cassava industry was for several years largely based on the export of cassava pellets to the European Union (EU). Despite the introduction of quotas bythe EU during the mid-1980s, which threatened to limit growth in this market, Thailand's comparative advantages have kept the cassava industry buoyant and other export markets in Asia, Eastern Europe and the Russian Federation have been developed. Thai cassava exports have continued to experience an annual growth rate of 7 percent from 1985 to 1990 (Table 2). Although export volumes from Indonesia are only one-tenth of those from Thailand, the former has experienced an even stronger growth (17.1 percent) during this period. During the period
1985 to 1990 increases occurred in cassava starch production and in Japan investments have been made into plants for producing modified cassava starch and other starch derived products (CIAT, 1992). The apparent decline in cassava production in the People's Republic of China (Table 1) is not substantiated by local figures, which report a significant increase (CIAT, 1992).

Cassava production in Africa increased from 58.2 million tonnes in 1985 to 64.1 million tonnes in 1990, a growth rate of 2 percent per annum. The most significant increase in production was recorded by Uganda, with a growth rate of 6.3 percent per annum. In Nigeria the ban on wheat imports provided a stimulus to cassava production, which rose from 13.5 million tonnes in 1985 to 17.6 million tonnes in 1990.
The crop is principally used as a human food, either fresh (boiled, baked, fried or pounded) or in numerous processed forms (Lancaster et al., 1982). Cassava is of growing importance, however, both for animal feed and as a raw material for producing starch, starch-based products and starch derivatives. Over the last 20 years, there has been mounting recognition of the contribution that cassava can make to increasing incomes and generating employment opportunities in the rural sector (CIAT, 1992).
As a crop cassava is one of the most efficient producers of starch, which constitutes about 85 percent of the storage root tissue dry-matter content. However, cassava starch represents only a small percentage of internationally traded starch. Annual production of cassava starch for industrial uses is about 800 000 tonnes, and originates mainly from Brazil (for the national market) and Thailand (for export to Japan and the EC). Native and modified starches are important raw materials for many industrial uses such as in food processing, paper, textile and adhesive manufacturing and in the oil drilling industry. Starch is also a raw material for producing many derived sugar products, such as glucose, fructose, maltodextrins and mannitol, each of which has specific properties and uses in food, chemical or pharmaceutical industries (Balagopalan et al., 1988).
Many small-scale cassava starch industries exist in tropical countries where the product has specific uses in traditional food industries corresponding to a specific market niche; eg krupuk in Indonesia, sago in India, pandebono in Colombia, biscoicho in Brazil and chipa in Paraguay. In Colombia and Brazil a naturally fermented starch is produced ("sour" starch) with specific functional properties that are irreplaceable in the manufacture of traditional breads. These small-scale industries have a high socio-economic importance in specific regions of these countries.
The roots of cassava are more highly perishable compared to those of the other major temperate or tropical root crops. This may be associated with the fact that, unlike other root crop storage organs, cassava roots exhibit no endogenous dormancy, have no function in propagation and possess no bud primordia from which regrowth can occur (Coursey and Booth, 1977; Passam and Noon, 1977). It is common knowledge that cassava roots senesce and deteriorate extremely rapidly after being detached from the plant. In general, due to physiological and pathological deterioration (see Chapters Two and One respectively), cassava roots cannot be kept in a satisfactory condition for more than a few days.
Studies on the deterioration of fresh cassava roots were conducted by the International Centre for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT) and the Natural Resources Institute (NRI) during the late 1970s. Research led to the development of a simple storage system based on root curing in polyethelene bags and treatment with a thiabendazole-based chemical to prevent the onset of deterioration (Wheatley, 1989). Thiabendazole is a permitted agent for post-harvest use in many fruits and vegetables, and residues in cassava tissues have been analysed at less than 20 percent of permitted levels. The storage system was successfully field-tested in several different ecosystems in Colombia.
Traditionally, the problem of storage has usually been overcome by leaving the roots in the ground until they are needed and, once harvested, consuming, marketing or processing immediately. Cassava is processed into a wide variety of products with a long shelf-life, which are traditionally prepared using a number of often fairly complex and time consuming processes (Lancaster et al., 1982). The roots can be left in the ground for several months after reaching optimal root development. The disadvantages of this system are that large areas of land are unavailable for further production, the roots loose some of their starch content, palatability declines as the roots become more fibrous (Rickard and Coursey, 1981) and cooking time increases (Wheatley and Gomez, 1985).
The post-harvest properties of cassava prohibit the holding of stocks of fresh roots at processing plants and restricts the supply area from which cassava can be obtained. The migration of rural populations to urban centres has exacerbated the problems of marketing fresh cassava by increasing the distance, and therefore time, between producers and consumers. Urbanization has been the dominant demographic force in all regions of the developing world since the 1950s (Table 3). The rapid post-harvest perishability of the fresh roots results in an inconvenient, often poor quality foodstuff for urban consumers (Wheatley and Best, 1991). Large marketing margins caused by the risks of commercializing a highly perishable product, together with the effects of subsidized imports, frequently make cassava more expensive than competing carbohydrate sources in the urban environment. These price, quality and convenience disadvantages are not relevant in rural areas, as freshly harvested
cassava is more readily available and marketing chains shorter.

Note: Year of estimation in parenthesis.
In many countries, especially in Latin America, urban consumers are changing from cassava to other more stable carbohydrate sources, such as rice and wheat-based products, and consequently consumption of cassava is lower in urban than in rural areas (Table 4). The production advantages of cassava, however, justify its development as an urban food. Cassava is one of the principal crops grown by small farmers in marginal areas of the developing world. In these areas environmental growth conditions are limiting factors and in many cases cassava is the only crop that can be grown in sufficient quantities to generate income.
Overcoming the post-harvest problems of cassava has therefore become an important factor for the small farmer. Research to make cassava more suitable for the urban consumer will provide direct benefits to the rural poor.

Chapter 1 Microbial deterioration of cassava: organisms involved
Earlier publications on the subject of the deterioration of cassava simply state that cassava roots will not store well, have a short storage life, will not keep for more than a few days and are highly perishable (Rickard and Coursey, 1981 ) without giving any indication of the nature or even the symptoms of the deterioration processes involved. Other publications refer loosely to "rots" or "decay", giving the impression that the deterioration is essentially due to microbiological infection.
The number of different species of fungi and bacteria isolated from roots stored under different conditions shows that post-harvest decay of cassava is a complex matter, involving more than a single initial organism. Two distinct specific types of rot have been described by Majumder (1955), a dry rot occurring under aerobic conditions and caused by an unidentified Rhizopus sp. and a soft rot which developed under anaerobic conditions caused by a Bacillus sp. Under West African conditions, Affran (1968) and Doku (1969) have suggested an association between post-harvest decay and preharvest infection of the roots with white thread disease, Rigidoporus lignosis (Klotzsch) Imasaki.
A more detailed investigation (Ekundayo and Daniel, 1973) indicated that soft rot of cassava roots was caused by a complex of fungi; Lasiodiplodia theobromae (Pat.) Griff. et Maubl., Aspergillus nigervan Tieghem, Aspergillus flavus Link, Cylindrocarpon candidum (Link) Wollenw and Trichoderma harizianum Rifia, the first organism being the most important. Although these workers clearly associated the decay with invasion through wounds, they concentrated on the later stages of decay rather than on the initiation of postharvest deterioration. Wegmann ( 1970), who also worked mainly with material that was in an advanced stage of deterioration, isolated A. niger together with "Cylindrium cladostrinum " (presumably C. clandestrinium (Corda) Saccardo) and unidentified Penicillium and Cladosporium spp. Studies by Burton (1970) on cassava shipped from Puerto Rico to the United States indicated that, while Diplodia manihotis (Sacc.) was the most serious market disease, a number of
other fungal pathogens were also isolated, including species of Fusarium, Mucor, Phomopsis, Rhizopus and Trichoderma spp.
Booth (1976), in a more detailed study on the deterioration of cassava, isolated from the surfaces of cassava roots various species of Pythium, Mucor, Rhizopus, Penicillium, Aspergillus, Fusarium, Cladosporium, Glomerella, Gloeosporium, Rhizoctonia, Bacillus, Xanthomonas, Erwinia, Agrobacterium and many saprophytic bacteria. However, Booth was consistently unable to isolate any specific microorganism from the advancing margins of deterioration in the flesh of the rots. It was therefore concluded that the earlier stages of postharvest deterioration, manifest as discoloration of the vascular tissue, were not inherently the results of attack by pathogens and that the later stages were essentially the decay of already moribund tissue caused by a wide variety of saprophytes.
In a later study by Noon and Booth ( 1977) a number of microorganisms, both fungi and bacteria, were isolated from severely decayed cassava roots. The pathogenicity of the organisms was tested by inoculating freshly harvested, surface-sterilized roots. Vascular streaking developed in the roots throughout the 14-days storage period under tropical ambient conditions (25°C). Within four days of harvest, over 50 percent of the roots showed symptoms of vascular streaking. Some of the isolated microorganisms proved to be pathogenic when introduced into healthy cassava roots, notably Botryodiplodia theobromae Pat. and to a lesser extent Aspergillus flavus Link, Trichoderma harizianum Rifia and Fusarium solani (Mart.) (Table5). In some cases inoculated roots developed symptoms of vascular streaking (Figure 3), but there was no evidence that this was associated with the introduced organisms. In these cases the inoculated organisms could not be recovered from the advancing fronts of
discoloration, although they could be recovered from the margins of the grossly necrotic areas. In other cases rotting was caused by the inoculated pathogen, but no vascular streaking occurred. The findings of Noon and Booth, which concluded that vascular streaking is a physiological process, were substantiated by a detailed cytochemical study of the development of vascular streaking using light and electron microscopic techniques. Rickard, Marriott and Gahan ( 1979) were unable to detect any signs of microbial infection during the early stages of vascular discoloration and, following results obtained using Phycomycetes, Taniguchi and Data (1984) also concluded that there was no direct relationship between vascular streaking in cassava roots and microbial decay.

On the basis of his observations, Booth (1976) made a clear distinction between primary deterioration of stored cassava roots, considered to be an endogenous physiological process (Figure 4), and secondary deterioration. Microbial activity is the most common cause of secondary deterioration although fermentation or root tissue softening can also occur. Primary deterioration is the initial and major cause of the loss of acceptability, while secondary deterioration can become more important later. On occasion secondary deterioration may be the initial cause of loss and in these instances symptoms of vascular streaking frequently occur ahead of the rots. Pre- and post-harvest root rot diseases of cassava have been reviewed by Booth (1978) and are summarized in Table 6.
