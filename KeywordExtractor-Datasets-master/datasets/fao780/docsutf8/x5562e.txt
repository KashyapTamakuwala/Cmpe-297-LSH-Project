A. Fourteenth McDougall Memorial Lecture
1. The fourteenth in the series of lectures at regular Conference sessions in memory of Frank Lidgett McDougall, a founding father of the Organization, was delivered by His Excellency Alan Garcia PÃ©rez, President of Peru.
B. Presentation of the B.R. Sen Awards for 1984 and 1985
2. The B.R. Sen Award was presented to Mr. Alfred G. Scherer (Federal Republic of Germany) for his work in the strengthening of the organization and management capabilities of the Nepal Food Corporation. Mr Scherer's association with FAO started in 1964. In 1965 he was FAO/OPAS (Operational Assistance) Horticultural and Marketing Adviser to Uganda and, in 1970, while retaining the position of Special Adviser to the Government, he was appointed Project Manager of the UNDP (United Nations Development Programme)/FAO Marketing and Storage Development Project, and in that capacity made a major contribution to the improvement of the operational and managerial efficiency of the Produce Marketing Board of Uganda. Mr Scherer was transferred to Brazil in 1975 as FAO Marketing Economist associated with the Companhia Brasileira de Alimentos (COBAL); in 1978 he became the Senior Marketing, Management and Training Adviser/Team Leader of the UNDP/FAO Project "Centre for Human Resource
Development in Agricultural Marketing" attached to COBAL where he distinguished himself in the organization of the COBAL training centre which offered in-service training programmes for 10 000 staff members. In 1983, Mr Scherer was transferred to Kathmandu as Team Leader/Management and Organization Adviser to the UNDP/FAO Technical Assistance Project for Strengthening the Nepal Food Corporation where he developed an improved system for operational and statistical data collection and management information and contributed to the improvement of communications between the Corporation's Headquarters and its field offices. He was also instrumental in developing a suitable planning methodology for maintaining optimal inventory levels at various procurement and distribution stores, for minimizing transportation costs, and determining staff training needs and the development of a comprehensive training programme. In this work, Mr Scherer gave particular emphasis to the practical
training and development of middle-level management and operational manpower indispensable to the efficient implementation of the government food policy; he thus made a significant contribution in strengthening the food security policies and programmes of Nepal. His outstanding technical competence displayed throughout his career coupled with his continuing efforts in promoting small farmer development through an integrated and practical marketing/production approach, led to the achievements which culminated in the bestowal of the award.
3. The B.R. Sen Award for 1985 was presented to Mr Lawrence Kwadjo Danso (Ghana) for improving the productivity of forest lands in North East Thailand through integrated rural development. When first employed by FAO in 1980, Mr Danso was appointed to the post of Forestry Officer/Chief Technical Adviser on the Project for the Development of Reforestation in North Eastern Thailand, with duty station in Korat. Mr Danso, responsible for advising and assisting the government in the overall planning, as well as the implementation and direction of all project activities, designed and helped to execute under difficult circumstances various preparatory activities, and guided the identification, demarcation and mapping of the pilot area. In cooperation with other government and non-government agencies, he carried out analytical studies of the project area as a basis for the preparation of a realistic work plan comprising institutional arrangements and changes in organizational
structures and procedures. He also designed and implemented a training programme for the project's national staff with an aim to make their involvement more productive. In order to ensure more effective on-site management and technical guidance, Mr Danso moved the site of the project to Khao Poo Luang, about 150 km from Korat, for over a year. The work undertaken by Mr Danso had broken new ground in the application of rural sociology to the problems of settlement in forest areas. He had demonstrated through personal achievement the appropriateness of FAO's policy of forestry for rural development.
C. Presentation of the A.H. Boerma Award 1984-85
4. The A.H. Boerma Award is presented biennially to a journalist or journalists whose work has helped to focus public attention on important aspects of the world food problem, with the likely result of having increased public support of measures leading to its solution.
5. On this, the fourth occasion, the Award for 1984-85 was shared by a noted television cameraman and producer, Mr Mohamed Amin of Kenya, and a distinguished journalist and writer, Ms Claire Brisset of France.
6. The Awards were presented by the Director-General to Mr Amin for his widely televised news coverage of the famine in Ethiopia, and for his documentary film on the famine afflicting more than 20 African countries, "African Calvary: Uncertain Redemption". Ms Brisset received the Award for her coverage of the problems of the Third World in many French-language journals of repute over a period of many years, with particular emphasis on the malnourished, especially children.

Fortieth Anniversary of FAO
36. The Constitution of FAO was signed by the original Member Nations in Quebec City, Canada, on 16 October 1945, thereby bringing the Organization into existence. The date is commemorated annually as World Food Day, following a decision of the FAO Conference in 1979.
37. The Conference noted that the Fortieth Anniversary of FAO was celebrated worldwide on World Food Day 1985. Regional events were organized by the FAO Regional Offices for Africa in Buea (Cameroon), for Latin America and the Caribbean in Santiago (Chile); and for Asia and the Pacific in Bangkok (Thailand), while national events took place in more than 140 countries.
38. At FAO Headquarters, a special ceremony was addressed by His Excellency Francesco Cossiga, President of the Italian Republic. Before the ceremony President Cossiga had unveiled a plaque to mark the start of work on an extension of the Headquarters buildings. These new buildings would permit all FAO staff in Rome to work at the Terme di Caracalla complex, and would avoid the need to rent accommodations in other parts of the city. The Conference was informed that the Italian Government had budgeted 25 000 million lire to finance the work.
39. Messages were sent to the Director-General by more than 80 Heads of State and Government, Ministers and other prominent personalities conveying their congratulations and good wishes on the occasion of the anniversary.
40. A series of exhibitions on the history and work of FAO were arranged on the FAO premises. One traced the founding of the International Institute for Agriculture established in Rome in 1905 at the instigation of David Lubin, and which was the precursor of FAO. A booklet entitled "FAO - the First Forty Years" was prepared, reviewing the main themes of the Organization's work in the past four decades. A special number of CERES, the FAO Review on Agriculture and Development, was devoted entirely to interviews with Heads of State or Government.
41. On 10 November, the first Sunday after the opening of the Conference, a special Mass was held at St. Peter's Basilica to celebrate the fortieth anniversary of the Organization and of the United Nations. In his homily on that occasion, His Holiness Pope John Paul II paid tribute to the work of FAO, and voiced his strong support for multilateral cooperation in the search for international social justice.
42. In the course of the Conference, the City of Rome inaugurated an FAO Park planted with trees chosen to represent different FAO regions. Member Nations were invited by the Mayor of Rome to contribute additional trees, both to beautify the park and to express its character as a symbol of global cooperation.
43. The Conference set aside one day - 14 November - to commemorate the anniversary. On that day, addresses were delivered by two specially invited Heads of State: His Excellency President Soeharto of Indonesia, and His Excellency President FranÃ§ois Mitterrand of France.
44. President Soeharto, after congratulating FAO on its anniversary, described the way in which Indonesia had more than doubled its food production in 15 years, thus achieving self-sufficiency. He announced a gift of 100 000 tons of paddy rice to FAO, collected by Indonesian farmers for the benefit of families suffering from hunger in other countries, especially in Africa.
45. President Mitterrand recalled the origins of FAO, and reiterated the commitment of France to finding solutions for the problems of developing countries. He felt that three main directions should be followed: reform of the international monetary system; full participation by developing nations in multilateral trade negotiations; and a global approach to the problems of debt and development.
46. Following the addresses by the two Heads of State, statements were made by the Director-General and by Heads of Delegation on behalf of the various regions. It was generally stressed that substantial progress had been made toward the goals established in 1945, but that even more remained to be accomplished before the age-old scourges of hunger and malnutrition could be vanquished. The tasks ahead might well be even more difficult than those in the past, as a result of increasing pressure of population on land resources. FAO and its Member Nations, as well as all concerned with food problems, would need to intensify their efforts in the years to come.
47. The Conference extended its thanks to all who had commemorated the anniversary in ceremonies held round the world. The Conference expressed its deep appreciation to President Cossiga of Italy, President Soeharto of Indonesia and President Mitterrand of France for honouring the Organization by their participation in the anniversary celebrations at FAO Headquarters. The Conference also expressed its deep appreciation to President Alan Garcia PÃ©rez of Peru, whose participation in the Conference as the McDougall Memorial lecturer represented an important contribution to the celebration of the fortieth anniversary.
48. The Conference expressed its appreciation to the Director-General and staff of the Organization for having taken the initiative for this celebration, and expressed its satisfaction with the way in which it had been organized.

State of Food and Agriculture (SOFA)
50. The Conference reviewed the world and regional food and agricultural situation on the basis of the Director-General's Report, The State of Food and Agriculture 1985 and its Supplement. It concurred with his assessment of the situation.
51. The Conference agreed that the early 1980s had been dominated by the economic recession that had had very negative consequences for food and agricultural production and food consumption, especially in developing countries. While the economic recovery had been strong in some industrialized countries, it had been less so in the majority of developing countries and had affected them unevenly. It was noted that this recovery in the developed countries had not had a beneficial effect on the growth of most developing countries. The problems of external debt in those countries, a decline in their flows of financial resources, declining international prices of their main export commodities and contracting export markets for agricultural products contributing to declining terms of trade, continued to pose serious obstacles to the resumption of widespread economic growth.
52. The Conference underlined the problems currently affecting agricultural commodity markets and the links between more liberalized trade, the expansion of export earnings and adequate servicing of international debt. The Conference called on Member States to reduce protectionism, including export subsidies and similar measures in agricultural markets, so that producers of agricultural products could expand their output and trade. It looked to the prospective round of multilateral trade negotiations under the auspices of GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) to resolve these grave problems.
53. Recognizing the difficulties in overcoming problems of financing international debt, the Conference also called for solutions that permitted economic adjustments to take place without jeopardizing the standard of living of the more economically vulnerable populations.
54. The Conference welcomed the longer-term analysis presented in the documents as well as the regional coverage. It noted that the regional experience during the early 1980s, both with regard to economic issues and progress in the food and agricultural sectors, had been extremely diverse, having been very negative for some regions but more positive in others.
55. There was continued and unanimous concern for Africa. The region had experienced average annual declines in per caput income and merchandise exports of nearly 2 percent and 3 percent respectively in the early 1980s. During this time, its debt-service ratio had nearly doubled. This overall situation had been accompanied by a decline in per caput food and agricultural production of nearly 2 percent a year, largely as a consequence of drought. Despite rising food imports, per caput food supplies had steadily declined. The Conference welcomed the widespread improvements in the food and agricultural situation in Africa during the current crop year, although it noted that economic problems continued at crisis levels and rendered the region still vulnerable to unfavourable weather conditions.
56. The Conference drew the attention of the international community to the need for continued support for long-term development efforts in Africa, although emergency aid would still need to be maintained in some cases. Support was expressed for FAO's efforts in the field of rehabilitation of agriculture in Africa. The Conference stressed the need for an early and adequate replenishment of the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), with its emphasis on small farm agriculture, typical in much of Africa. Support was also given to other initiatives, both bilateral and multilateral, aimed at financing the development of Africa over the long term.
57. The Conference also stated that food aid should play a continuing and important role in agricultural development in Africa. Seven million tons out of the total shipments of more than 12 million tons of food aid in cereals had been devoted to meeting Africa's food aid needs in 1984/85, but emergency needs in 1985/86 would be significantly lower.
58. The recent economic and agricultural situation also had been very discouraging in Latin America and the Caribbean in the early 1980s. Per caput incomes also had declined in the region, the growing external debt was US$360000 million, debt-service ratios were at very high levels (more than 40 percent of export earnings) and inflation rates had soared. Following the increases in the 1970s, agricultural production per caput and exports also had fallen. The problems of protectionism and extreme competition in agricultural markets, which caused the displacement of exports from low-cost producing countries, were particularly stressed. Similarly, declining food imports pointed to a deteriorating nutritional situation.
59. Some difficulties were being experienced in the Near East Region, although in part this stemmed from the worsening external economic environment. Declining agricultural production of some countries confronting rising demand for food had led to greatly increased food imports. Declining export earnings made the continued financing of such imports difficult and budgetary constraints were leading to pressures to reduce food subsidies, which contributed to social tensions in the region.
60. The Conference welcomed the progress that had been achieved in China and the Far East despite the recent difficult economic environment. Although deep-seated problems remained, incomes had increased significantly as had agricultural production. Per caput farm income had reportedly increased in China by 15 percent in 1084-. Overall per caput incomes
