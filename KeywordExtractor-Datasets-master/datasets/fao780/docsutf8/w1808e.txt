<title>The World Sorghum and Millet Economies: Facts, Trends and Outlook</title>
<section>1</section>
Summary
Sorghum is the world's fifth most important cereal, in terms of both production and area planted. Millet, a general category for several species of small-grained cereal crops, is the world's seventh most important cereal grain. Roughly 90 percent of the world's sorghum area and 95 percent of the world's millet area lie in the developing countries, mainly in Africa and Asia. These crops are primarily grown in agroecologies subject to low rainfall and drought. Most such areas are unsuitable for the production of other grains unless irrigation is available. Sorghum is widely grown both for food and as a feed grain, while millet is produced almost entirely for food.
The world sorghum economy can be broadly categorized under two production and utilization systems. Intensive, commercialized production, mainly for livestock feed, characterize the developed world and parts of Latin America and the Caribbean. Hybrid seed, fertilizer and improved water management technologies are used fairly widely, and yields average 3-5 t/ha. Such commercialized production systems cover less than 15 percent of the world's sorghum area, but produce over 40 percent of global output. Roughly 40 percent of this grain is traded on international stockfeed markets. In sharp contrast are the low-input, extensive production systems in most of the developing world (with some exceptions in Latin America and the Caribbean), where sorghum is grown mainly for food. While improved varieties are being adopted in such systems, particularly in Asia, management practices generally remain less intensive than in the commercialized systems. Fertilizer rates are low and the
adoption of improved moisture conservation technologies is limited. As a result, average yields remain between 0.5 and 1.0 t/ha in many areas.
Millet production systems in Africa and Asia are generally characterized by extensive (rather than intensive) production practices and limited adoption of improved varieties. Yields still average only 0.3 to 1.0 t/ha. While hybrids are being adopted in parts of Asia, most of the world's millet area remains under traditional varieties. Few farmers apply fertilizer or use improved moisture conservation practices.
Sorghum and millet are crucial to the world food economy because they contribute to household food security in many of the world's poorest, most food-insecure regions. In the main production regions in Africa and Asia, more than 70 percent of the sorghum crop and over 95 percent of the millet crop are consumed as food. A large proportion of farm households aim simply to produce enough grain to meet household requirements - and many often fail to meet even this limited goal. Only a small proportion of the harvest is traded, mostly on local food markets.
In Africa, the agroclimatic factors most responsible for food insecurity also constrain the adoption of improved technology. Farmers at the margins of subsistence find it risky to invest in new technology. A growing proportion of farmers are beginning to adopt new varieties because only a small investment is required to change seed. However, they are less willing to allocate scarce cash resources to purchase chemical fertilizer or manure. Allocations of capital and family labour required to improve water and nutrient availability to the crop are limited because of the perception of higher returns from alternative farm and non-farm enterprises. For example, investments in schooling compete directly with investments in the cropping system.
In recent years, sorghum and millet production in Africa has expanded mainly due to increases in cropped area. Yields have failed to increase or have even declined because production is being pushed into more marginal areas and poorer soils, even in areas that are already drought-prone. Nonetheless, farmers are expected to begin intensifying production practices as land constraints become binding and the costs of food production shortfalls mount.
Market infrastructure in Asia is relatively well developed, especially in areas with high population density. As a result, adoption of improved technology has been earlier and more widespread than in Africa, resulting in significant yield growth over the past three decades. Production systems in the drier and less populated regions are more similar to those in Africa, with unimproved production and management practices, low adoption of improved technology and food insecurity.
Overall, the area planted to sorghum and millet has been declining in Asia. Slow productivity growth and low producer prices have reduced the competitiveness of these cereals, resulting in crop substitution in many areas. In some cases, sorghum and millet have shifted into more marginal lands, where their adaptation to drier, less fertile conditions gives them a comparative advantage over other cereals.
Virtually all the sorghum traded on international markets is used for livestock feed. This is the basis for the more commercialized production systems of the developed world and parts of Latin America and the Caribbean. Global feed utilization of sorghum has declined during the last decade, mainly due to changes in agricultural support policies. However, the prospects for future demand growth for feed sorghum, particularly in Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean, are expected to strengthen the sorghum economy in these regions.
Small quantities of sorghum are used by commercial food industries in the production of flour, malt drinks and beer. There are good prospects for the expansion of this market if sorghum yields can rise fast enough to catch up with yields of competing cereals, and if marketing costs are kept low.
Millet is traded internationally in small quantities, for use as bird seed, mainly among developed countries. However, this is a thin market with limited prospects for expansion. Millet traded as food is largely confined to cross-border transactions. Future production growth in millet will be used mainly to offset localized food shortfalls.
Food security still represents the primary goal of efforts to improve the world sorghum and millet economies. For most farmers, increased production will translate directly into higher consumption and better nutrition.
As household consumption needs are met, a larger share of production may be traded on regional markets. Thus, higher production and productivity should also mean income growth - particularly important in the major production areas, which are farmed by some of the world's most impoverished populations.

Introduction
Sorghum is one of the main staples for the world's poorest and most food-insecure people. The crop is genetically suited to hot and dry agroecologies where it is difficult to grow other food grains. These are also areas subject to frequent drought. In many of these agroecologies, sorghum is truly a dual-purpose crop; both grain and stover are highly valued outputs. In large parts of the developing world, stover represents up to 50 percent of the total value of the crop, especially in drought years.
Developing countries account for roughly 90 percent of the world's sorghum area and 70 percent of total output (Figs. 1 and 2). Asia and Africa each account for about 25-30 percent of global production (Table 1). Much of the crop is grown by small-scale farming households operating at the margins of subsistence. Production in Africa remains characterized by low productivity and extensive, low-input cultivation. Production is generally more intensive in Asia, where fertilizer and improved seed are used far more widely. On both continents, sorghum is grown primarily for food. In contrast, in the developed countries, almost all sorghum production is used as animal feed.
This categorization i.e., developing countries as food producers and developed countries as feed producers - is generally true, but not always. For example, some developing countries in Latin America and the Caribbean (e.g., Mexico and Argentina) are major producers of sorghum for the feed market (Fig. 1). Correspondingly, this report evaluates production, utilization and trade patterns both regionally and by intensity of the production system. Sorghum production systems fall under two broad groups.
· Group I countries (primarily in Asia and Africa) use sorghum for food. The crop tends to be grown in traditional farming systems; yields generally average less than 1 t/ha and can vary considerably from year to year.
· Group II countries (developed countries and some developing countries) produce sorghum on a commercial basis, primarily for animal feed. The use of modern agricultural practices is widespread, and yields correspondingly average 3-5 t/ha.
Statistical documentation of sorghum production, trade and utilization is generally quite good, especially in countries where production is commercialized. Data are less accurate in countries where sorghum is primarily a subsistence crop, grown in outlying areas.

Crop distribution
In Western and Central Africa, sorghum is grown throughout the belt between the Sahara desert in the north and the equatorial forests in the south (Fig. 2). In Southern and Eastern Africa it is grown in drier regions, where precipitation is too low for the successful cultivation of maize.
Nigeria and Sudan are the major producers in Africa (Table 1), but sorghum is widely distributed, and a key food staple in large parts of the continent. Production in Asia is far more concentrated in geographical terms, with two countries, China and India, together producing 94 percent of the regional total.
Sorghum production in Central America and the Caribbean is dominated by Mexico, which produces 90 percent of the region's total. In South America, production is concentrated in Argentina (60 percent of the regional total) and in the dry areas of Brazil, northern Colombia and Venezuela.
Developed countries produce nearly one-third of the world's sorghum. In North America, it is cultivated in the central and southern plains of the United States (mainly in Kansas, Texas and Nebraska), where rainfall is low and variable. The United States is the world's largest producer, with over 25 percent of global output. Production in Europe is limited to small areas in France, Italy and Spain. In Oceania, Australia is the only producer of significance.

Production trends
Trends in overall output
Global sorghum production fell by 0.7 percent per annum between 1979 and 1994 (Table 2, and Fig. 3), in contrast to annual increases in the production of other major grains: wheat (1.8 percent), rice (2.3 percent) and maize (1.7 percent). During this period, production grew in Africa (2.9 percent), but declined in most other parts of the world, particularly in North and South America (Table 2).
In the majority of Group I (developing) countries, increases in total output remained below population growth (Table 2). Consequently, per caput production declined during the 1980s before recovering partially in the early 1990s.

Within Group I there were two distinct trends. In Asia, production has fallen over the past decade (Fig. 3), largely because of sharp declines in area and production in China. In India, production grew by almost 5 percent per annum during the 1970s, but has remained unchanged during the past decade as sorghum has been replaced by more profitable crops such as pulses and oilseeds. The loss in area was partly compensated by higher productivity obtained by using improved varieties and fertilizer; yields climbed steadily from around 650 kg/ha in the early 1970s to just under 900 kg/ha currently. In Africa, in contrast, production increased, particularly during the first half of the 1980s. This increase was due to area expansion into drier lands as a result of population growth; yields, in fact, fell during the period.
In Group II (developed countries, Argentina and Mexico) production fell by almost 40 percent during the latter half of the 1980s, essentially because policy interventions led to reductions in sorghum area. In the United States, output has nearly halved over the past 10 years. During 1985-88, sorghum area in the United States fell from 6.8 million to 3.7 million hectares as a result of two major events.
(i) Farm legislation enacted in 1985 lowered support prices for sorghum compared to cotton or maize (the main competing crops), introduced the interchangeability of sorghum and maize base areas, made crop insurance benefits lower for sorghum, and allowed sorghum growers to idle large areas. Together, these changes encouraged farmers to replace sorghum with other crops.
(ii) Relatively more drought-tolerant maize varieties were developed, and in combination with the increased application of no-tillage technology, allowed the maize belt to extend further west into traditional sorghum land. As a result, universities and private seed companies have cut back on sorghum research.
In Argentina, sorghum production fell from 8 million tons in 1983 to 3 million tons in 1988, because there was a drastic fall in imports by the former USSR^1.
[^1. The former USSR was a large importer of maize and sorghum from the United States. Following the grain embargo led by the United States in the early 1980s, USSR began importing large quantities of sorghum from Argentina. These purchases fell drastically after the ban was lifted, as price trends favoured the purchase of maize (from the United States).]
Trends in area and yields
Sorghum is currently grown on 45 million hectares worldwide (1992-94 average, Table 1). The cropped area is expanding in Africa, where it grew from 13 million to almost 22 million hectares between 1979-81 and 1992-94 (Fig. 4). However, the area is declining elsewhere; global sorghum area fell by 0.2 percent per annum between 1979 and 1994 (Table 2). South America was the most affected, mainly as a result of developments in Argentina.
As for most crops, sorghum yields have risen as new technologies (improved varieties, higher input use, and to some extent better resource management and disease/pest control) were developed and disseminated. The exception is Africa, where yields fell by 14 percent during the 1980s before rising once more in the early 1990s (Fig. 5). In India, yields vary significantly between regions, depending on rainfall, soil type and season. Yields of rainy-season sorghum are 2-2.5 t/ha in areas with deep soils and assured rainfall, but postrainy-season yields are less than 500 kg/ha in many low-rainfall areas.
There are sharp contrasts in productivity between regions: yields (1992-94 average) were 0.8 t/ha in Africa, 1.2 t/ha in Asia, over 4 t/ha in North America, and over 5 t/ha in Europe (Table 1). The reason for these differences is essentially the degree of commercialization and the corresponding adoption of new technologies. Mexico is a good example of dramatic growth created by large-scale commercialization. The sorghum area in Mexico rose from 0.1 million to 1.5 million hectares from the 1960s through the early 1980s. Average yields rose to over 3 t/ha, exceeding the national average for maize by one-third.
In a number of Group II countries, the use of hybrid seed, fertilizer and irrigation have ensured that yields have increased even from a high base level. By contrast, in Group I, most sorghum is produced on small, fragmented plots; sometimes intercropped, and frequently in areas where soil fertility is low. There is generally limited use of purchased inputs due to financial constraints. However, a few Group I countries (e.g., Sudan and Zimbabwe) produce part of their sorghum on large farms for commercial purposes, using high inputs and sometimes supplementary irrigation. Large commercial farmers in Zimbabwe harvest 2-3 t/ha compared to 400-600 kg/ha by traditional smallholders.
One important factor underlying yield trends is the adoption of hybrids. Hybrids are most widely used in areas where sorghum is produced commercially and in countries with a well-developed private seed industry. Correspondingly, the use of hybrids is concentrated in Group II countries.
Figure 4. Global trends in sorghum area, 1979-94.
Figure 5. Global trends in sorghum yield, 1979-94 (3-year moving average).
In most Group I countries - notable exceptions are China, India, Thailand, Sudan and Zimbabwe -the use of hybrids is negligible. Most hybrids are developed (in Group II) for feed sorghum. However, they are also being developed for the food market in some Group I countries, particularly in India, where they occupy approximately 55 percent of the sorghum area.
Falling yields in Africa, where sorghum is a key food security crop, are a major cause for concern. Population growth has forced an expansion of sorghum area, often into drier, more marginal lands. In some countries, government market policies have encouraged the reallocation of relatively productive sorghum fields to maize. To some extent, this is the result of market policies which have encouraged commercial trade and processing of maize but not of sorghum. In areas where this change has not occurred, fallow periods have often become shorter, giving the land less time to replenish nutrients. Since fertilizer application is generally very low, the net result is a decline in soil fertility. However, although yields have clearly fallen, the decline has not been as sharp as the figures (1.0 percent per year between 1979 and 1994, Table 2) would suggest. This is because the 1979-81 data are for relatively good land, while the 1992-94 figures are for a mixture of "good" and more
marginal lands.
Production constraints
The majority of smallholder farmers, especially in the semi-arid tropical regions of Africa, do not produce enough sorghum to meet family requirements in most years. They see sorghum (and crop production in general) as a semi-subsistence enterprise that offers smaller returns than other investments such as livestock or school fees. As a result, they tend not to invest in fertilizers or seed of improved varieties.
Rising labour costs have also affected most farm operations, from land preparation, weeding and bird scaring to harvesting and grain processing. Another factor, important throughout Asia and in urban areas in Africa, is changing food preferences. As incomes rise, consumers tend to purchase wheat, rice and in some cases maize, rather than traditional coarse grains.
In some areas production is constrained by birds, which attack the crop particularly during the grain-filling stage. To minimize bird damage, sorghum with a purple undercoat is cultivated in some countries. The undercoat contains tannins, bitter, stringent substances (polyphenols) that are distasteful to birds. However, most varieties grown in Africa and Asia do not contain tannin and are, therefore, susceptible to bird damage.
Another major constraint to sorghum production is Striga, a parasitic weed that attaches itself to the sorghum roots from where it draws its moisture and nutrient requirements, inhibiting plant growth, reducing yields and in severe cases, causing plant death. Some Striga-resistant sorghum varieties have been developed, but these generally offer lower yields than traditional cultivars and improved (but Striga-susceptible) varieties.
Grain moulds cause significant losses in both grain yield and quality, particularly in areas where improved cultivars have been adopted^2. Other important diseases include anthracnose, charcoal rot, downy mildew, ergot and leaf blight. Insect pests constrain production in many areas. Stem borers are endemic in all areas; head bugs and midge are most important in Western Africa; and shoot fly causes substantial losses in late and off-season sowings in both Asia and Africa.
[^2. Most improved varieties mature earlier than local varieties, often before the end of the rainy season. This results in increased susceptibility to grain moulds, greatly limiting the adoption of these varieties.]
Another major problem is that variable rainfall leads to large fluctuations in production. Prices fall abruptly in good years, leaving traders reluctant to enter the market, especially since stockholding infrastructure is usually inadequate. This increases the price risk that sorghum producers face, and their unwillingness to invest in commercial sorghum production.
Inadequate government policy support also limits the expansion of sorghum output in many Group I countries. For example, in Africa, as government production support measures for sorghum are relatively small compared to maize, the latter encroached onto sorghum land. In Asia, particularly in India, irrigation and fertilizer subsidies have increasingly favoured rice, wheat and cash crops at the expense of coarse grains, while procurement policies for rice and wheat have helped to increase to a large extent the area under these crops. In a number of developing countries that had long-standing price support policies for sorghum, this support has been drastically reduced or eliminated, mainly as a result of market deregulation.
<section>4</section>
Utilization
Worldwide, total utilization of sorghum fell slightly from 65.4 million tons in 1979-81 to 63.5 million tons in 1992-94 (Table 3). In the early 1980s an estimated 39 percent of global production was used as food and 54 percent for feed. The proportion of food utilization has gradually increased as a result of a greater food use in Africa and the substitution of sorghum by other grains (mainly maize) as feed elsewhere. By 1992-94, 42 percent of total utilization was for food and 48 percent for animal feed.
Food use
Worldwide, approximately 27 million tons of sorghum were consumed as food each year during the 1992-94 period (Table 3), almost the entire amount in Africa and Asia. It is a key staple in many parts of the developing world, especially in the drier and more marginal areas of the semi-arid tropics. Per caput food consumption of sorghum in rural producing areas is more stable, and usually considerably higher, than in urban centres. And within these rural areas, consumption tends to be highest in the poorest, most food-insecure regions.
Sorghum is eaten in a variety of forms that vary from region to region. In general, it is consumed as whole grain or processed into flour, from which traditional meals are prepared. There are four main sorghum-based foods:
· flat bread, mostly unleavened and prepared from fermented or unfermented dough in Asia and parts of Africa;
· thin or thick fermented or unfermented porridge, mainly consumed in Africa;
· boiled products similar to those prepared from maize grits or rice;
· preparations deep-fried in oil.
Per caput consumption of sorghum - and its importance as a food security crop - is highest in Africa. For example, per caput consumption is 90-100 kg/yr in Burkina Faso and Sudan; sorghum provides over one-third of the total calorie intake in these two countries. However, per caput food consumption in Africa has fallen slightly (0.1 percent per annum) between 1979 and 1994 (Table 4), most sharply in Eastern Africa. Sorghum production in Africa rose by 44 percent during this period, but even this increase was not quite sufficient to keep pace with population growth.
During the 1979-94 period, per caput consumption of sorghum declined slightly through the 1980s, as a result of strong production growth. If this growth could be maintained, food security and nutrition levels could be improved substantially in rural areas, where over 90 percent of food sorghum in Africa is consumed.
In Asia, sorghum continues to be a crucial food security crop in some areas (e.g., rural Maharashtra in India, where per caput consumption is over 70 kg/yr). However, both production and food utilization have fallen during the 1980s and early 1990s, because of shifting consumer preferences. As incomes rise, consumers are shifting to wheat and rice which taste better and are easier and faster to cook. This trend is accentuated by rapid urbanization and the growing availability of a range of convenience foods based on wheat and rice.
Government policies in a number of countries have also contributed to the decline in food utilization of sorghum. For instance, imports of relatively cheap wheat and rice by many countries discouraged the consumption of locally produced cereals. In other countries (China and India), government purchases and sales of sorghum under public distribution systems were discontinued, lowering utilization in urban areas. In several countries, consumer subsidies, overvalued currencies or subsidized imports kept prices of wheat and/or rice relatively low, reducing the competitiveness of domestically produced coarse grains. However, structural adjustment programmes and the implementation of the Uruguay Round Agreement are reducing these market distortions in a number of countries.
Animal feed
About 48 percent of world sorghum grain production is fed to livestock (human food use constitutes about 42 percent). In contrast to food utilization, which is relatively stable, utilization for feed sorghum changes significantly in response to two factors: rising incomes, which stimulate the consumption of livestock products, and the price competitiveness of sorghum vis-a-vis other cereals, especially maize. While sorghum is generally regarded as an inferior cereal when consumed as food, the income elasticities for livestock products (and hence the derived demand for feed) are generally positive and high.
Demand for animal feed is concentrated in the developed countries and in middle-income countries in Latin America and Asia, where demand for meat is high and the livestock industry is correspondingly intensive. Over 85 percent of sorghum feed use occurs in Group II (Fig. 6). Three countries (United States, Mexico and Japan) together absorb nearly 70 percent of the world total (Table 5).

Developed countries
World feed use rose from 16 million tons at the beginning of the 1960s to about 35 million tons by the mid 1980s, an average growth of 4 percent per annum. This demand was the main driving force in raising global production and international trade during that period. One major factor was increased use of sorghum feed in the United States during the 1960s and early 1970s, largely because the cattle-feeding industry shifted from the northern maize belt to the southern plains, where most United States sorghum is grown. Another factor was sharply rising demand for livestock products in Latin America, particularly in Mexico. In addition, government policies in some Latin American countries (e.g., Venezuela) restricted maize imports.
Trends since then were shaped by two events -response by the former USSR to the United States' grain embargo on sales in the early 1980s, and policy changes in the United States that favoured maize over sorghum. These factors led to an increase in maize production; maize became cheaper than sorghum, and sorghum trade and utilization for animal feed declined. Feed utilization has gradually increased in Africa and remained relatively unchanged in the lower-income countries in Asia. Roughly 5-10 percent of the sorghum produced in India - and a considerably higher proportion in China - is used for livestock and poultry feed. However, both these regions are relatively minor users of feed; changes in utilization trends are driven largely by the Group II countries, particularly the United States.
Sorghum vs maize. Competition between sorghum and maize is a key factor in feed utilization. The feed characteristics of sorghum are very similar to those of other cereals with which it competes. It provides about as much metabolizable energy as maize, has a higher crude protein content (though of lower quality), and is relatively rich in niacin, an essential vitamin. However, large investments in maize research have helped increase yields and reduce growing cycles for this competing energy source. This has improved the competitiveness of maize prices in many countries.
Feed industries in most countries apply least-cost formulations to produce compound feeds, in which sorghum/maize is mixed with non-grain ingredients. The quantity of sorghum used in feed depends primarily on the relative prices of sorghum and maize, and on relative feed value.
Another important factor is consumer preference for meat colour. Maize contains higher carotene levels than sorghum, so meat from maize-fed animals tends to be more yellow than meat from sorghum-fed animals. In Japan for example, consumers generally prefer white-coloured meat. Therefore, sorghum is a valued ingredient in some compound feed rations (for poultry, pigs and some breeds of beef cattle). In contrast, sorghum is discounted by producers in India because consumers there generally prefer poultry meat and egg yolks with a deeper yellow colour.
In addition, farmers in Asia have shown a growing interest in the sale and purchase of sorghum fodder. While the use of sorghum crop residues in Africa remains largely restricted to the farm, there is a large and growing market in Asia for traded sorghum residues to meet both rural feed shortfalls and urban agricultural demand, the latter largely for maintenance of dairy animals.

Other uses
Another important outlet for grain sorghum, especially in Africa, is in the preparation of alcoholic beverages. The grain is used for malt or as an adjunct in the production of two types of beer: clear beer and opaque beer, a traditional, lo
