Background Following the receipt of a letter (Reference GCP/INT/679/EC) from the FAO Representative in Nigeria (Hashin A-Ashami) by the Federal Director of Forestry, Abuja (Mr. G. O. Igugu), we (Messrs. Olaleye and Ameh) were contacted to prepare a Forest Resource Situation Assessment Report for Nigeria. To facilitate our release and speedy implementation of this assignment, necessary approvals were sought and obtained from the Permanent Secretary, Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources, Abuja. A contract for the assignment was then signed by the Federal Director of Forestry, Mr. G. O. Igugu.
Terms of References (TOR) Under the general supervision of the Director, Forest Resources Division, Forestry Department and the direct supervision of the Co-ordinator EC FAO Partnership Programme on Data Collection and Analysis for Sustainable Forestry Management in ACP Countries and in close collaboration with Forestry Officers involved in the implementation of the ECFAO Project, the incumbent will:  Collect and compile available data on forest and vegetation cover:  Provide forest and vegetation classification scheme used in the country as well as the current status of each forest/vegetation classes; and  Report on the forest volumes (growing stock, increment and harvesting intensities for each type of forest class at national level and if possible at sub-national level (regions). For this study, the incumbent will carry out a review of the existing documents and information from 1992 up-till now. Besides, it is requested that relevant source information (inventory reports, maps and) should be duplicated and made available for FAO. In support of this study, two FRA/FAO technical papers are herewith (see attachment) a) b) FRA 2000; Guidelines for assessments in tropical and sub-tropical countries; and FRA 2000; Terms and Definitions.

Limitations of the assignment.
During the course of this assignment, seven major limitations were encountered. These include:.
Limited source of documents.
Available documents on the forest Resource Situation are few and are scattered in different organisations located in different parts of the country. 1.4.2 Lack of complete and up-to-date information on forest resources.
The most current information on the Forest Resource Situation in Nigeria is provided in draft report by Beak Consultants of Canada who have just completed the inventory of the high forests and plantations in Nigeria. This implies that their reports are yet to be appraised by the Federal Government of Nigeria.
Limited coverage of the forest inventory.
The inventory exercise conducted by Beak Consultants of Canada covered only twenty-eight (28) states of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. The inventory did not include eight (8) arid states of Northern Nigeria.
Comparable Recent Forest Resource Information not available.
The last inventory of the high forests in Nigeria was done about 20 years ago by the FAO and UNDP. The degree of reliability of information from the recent inventory may be difficult to assess due to many factors including modern technology.
Time constraints. Sufficient time was not available for the assignment, particularly to source for information from various locations in Nigeria.
Production delays. Production delays were encountered during the preparation of this report due to frequent and prolonged power outages in Ibadan.
FAO Input Data.
This chapter deals with all the questionnaires associated with the FAO Input Data. Relevant documents are attached where necessary. All input tables were produced using Microsoft Excel. Answers have been provided for all the sections (1 -) based on available information (see Appendix 3).
3.1. A Report on the Forest Resource Situation Assessment of Nigeria Introduction:.
Nigeria is one of the countries in the West Africa sub-region. It is located between Latitudes 40-140N and Longitude 20-140E. It has a total area of 923,768km2. The population of Nigeria is estimated to be 90 million (1991 Census). It is bounded by the Republic of Chad and Niger Republic in the north, Benin Republic in the west, the Republic of Cameroon in the east and by the Atlantic Ocean in the south.
Administrative subdivision of Nigeria. The Federal Republic of Nigeria is currently divided into 36 states and a Federal Capital Territory called Abuja as shown in Table 1 below. The States are further sub-divided into 776 local government areas.

Ecological Zones of Nigeria The major ecological zones of Nigeria are as follows:.
Freshwater swamps Forest.
Lowland Rainforest.
Mangrove Forest.
Montane Savanna.
Sudan Savanna.
Guinea Savanna.
Jos Plateau.
Derived Savanna.
Sahel Savanna.
3.4 Vegetation Classification: The vegetation classification of Nigeria is very similar to the ecological classification shown in Figure 2 above. Vegetation classes are derived from the modification of the ecological zones by human interference.
Forest Types in Nigeria The most recent classification of forests in Nigeria was done by Beak Consultants (1998) for FORMECU. Eight major forest types are recognised in the Forest Resources Study Area, which consists of about 28 States of the country. The States excluded from the study are the eight arid states in the northern part of the country namely: Sokoto, Zamfara, Katsina, Jigawa, Yobe, Borno, Gombe and Bauchi. The forest classification types are listed below: Savanna and woodland Lowland Rain Forest Freshwater Swamps Forest Mangrove Forest Montane Forest Riparian Forest Plantation (agriculture) Plantation (Forest).

Status of forests in Nigeria.
The current status of forests in Nigeria is based on the work of Beak Consultants for FORMECU titled "The Forest Resources Study (FRS) of Nigeria". Table 3 below shows the area of various forest types in the forest reserves and free areas. The total areas of these forest categories are also provided.

Forest Reserves, Free Areas and Conservation Areas.
Forest Reserves.
It is estimated that the total area of these forest reserves is 10 million ha which is about 10% of the total land area of Nigeria (World Bank 1992). It should be noted that forest reserves within the forest reserves vary according to ecological classification. Hence, forest reserves in the Savanna and Sahel regions may not necessarily have adequate timber resources like those in the lowland rain forest areas of southern Nigeria. These forest reserves are owned by the State Governments and managed the State Forestry Departments (SFDS) who have professional and technical staff including uniform guards for performing their various responsibilities. The reservation of land for forestry purposes was at its peak during colonial times. Efforts to increase the size of the reserves (forestry estate) since then have not been too successful. Hence, only about 10% of the land area of the country is currently under forest reserves. As shown in Table 3 the total area in forest reserves of the FRS Study Area is 2,740,887 ha. It should be noted that the bulk of the forestry products and services are obtained from the management of the forest reserves. Some of the major products include poles, sawnwood, veneer and fuelwood. However, these products are still obtainable from "free areas " of the country.
Free Areas.
Free areas are forested areas that are not under strict management by the SFDs. However, permission to exploit trees from free areas still have to be obtained from SDFs. As can be seen in Table 3, the total area in free forest areas in the study area is 11,780,896 ha. They provide additional sources of forest products and services. In fact, they are considered to be very.
important for private forestry development. Some of the areas have been targeted as Potential Plantation Areas (PPAs).
Conservation Areas Conservation areas in Nigeria include National Parks, Game and Wildlife sanctuaries, proposed Game Reserves/Wildlife Sanctuaries and Strict Nature Reserves (SNR). Table 4 is an updated list of conservation areas in the country. Table 4 - Updated List of Conservation Areas in Nigeria.

This list is based on the World Bank Report (Forest Sector Review) of 1992. As shown in Table 4, the total area under conservation is 3,989,871 ha. It is worth noting that there are now six National Parks (NP) in Nigeria namely: Kainji NP (534,082 ha), Old Oyo NP (251,200 ha), Cross River NP (280,000 ha), Gashaka-Gumti NP (640,248 ha) Yankari NP (224,410 ha) and Chad Basin NP (225,800 ha). The total area occupied by the six National Parks in the country is 2,155,740 ha. The National Parks Service manages all National Parks. Each of the National Parks is headed by a General Manager and supported by professional and technical staff. Apart from National Parks, other conservation areas include Game Reserves/Wildlife Sanctuaries and Strict Nature Reserves (SNRs). These categories of conservation areas are managed mainly by the wildlife sections of the SFDs. However, foreign organisations and Non-governmental organisation (NGOs) are very active in the management of SNRs. Generally, conservation areas in Nigeria are still considered to be inadequate to protect biologically diverse environments in the country. Of particular interests are the Niger-Delta area and the Hadeja-Nguru wetlands. Oil exploration activities have adversely affected the environment in the Niger Delta areas. Human activities such as bush burning and shifting cultivation are destroying the ecosystem of the Hadejia-Nguru wetlands. Hence, the area is now gradually being destroyed as habitat for migratory birds from Europe.
Land Ownership and Tenure.
The Land Use Decree No 6 of 1978 guides land ownership and tenure. By this decree, the authority to own any piece of land, including forestry land, is exclusively vested on the Governor of the State where the land is located. "The objective of this Decree was to make land easily accessible to every Nigerian for development purposes in any part of the country and to vest the control of such development in the State Government so that the use of the land would be monitored and controlled" (World Bank, 1992). The implication of this decree as far as forest reserves are concerned is that, these lands belong to the various State Governments. In addition, this implies that private investors should not have difficulties in obtaining land for forestry development.
Inventory of the High Forests and Plantations in Nigeria.
Overview.
In March 1993, the African Development Bank (ADB), Abidjan, approved a grant of UA 1.72 million for the implementation of a study tagged "The Forest Resources Study of Nigeria". The overall objective of the study is to enhance industrial forestry development in the country and to facilitate management of its remaining forest resources in all efficient and environmentally adequate way. Essentially, the study consists of three major components namely: A. Inventory of the high forest areas in the southern one quarter of the country i.e. about 20,000 km2. The following States constitute the study area concerning high forest: Lagos, Oyo, Ogun, Osun, Ondo/Ekiti, Edo, Anambra, Delta, Rivers/Bayelsa, Imo, Akwa-Ibom, Abia, Cross River and Enugu/Ebonyi. B. Inventory of forest plantations throughout the country, except those in the arid north. Specifically, the States involved include all states inventoried for the high forest and the following States: Kwara, Niger, Kogi, Benue, Taraba, Adamawa, Plateau/Nasarawa, Kaduna, Kano and Kebbi. C. Sub-studies, which include private sector involvement and socio-economic assessment, wood-based industrial sector review, market and pricing policy assessment, review of forest legislation, survey of indigenous fruit trees (IFTs), and silvicultural investigation of selected IFTs. The following States in the arid north are not covered by the study: Sokoto/Zamfara, Katsina, Jigawa, Yobe, Bauchi/Gombe and Borno). The FRS was implemented as a consultancy assignment by Beak Consultants of Canada with the support of the Federal Government of Nigeria (FGN). Some of the specific obligations of FGN include provision of relevant documents to facilitate the study, establishment of a study implementation unit (SIU), secondment of appropriate staff (mainly inventory officers) and financial resources to pay staff emoluments. The FRS was expected to be completed in 24 months with effect from December 1995. The results of this study is urgently needed for providing adequate and up-to-date information on the forest resource situation in the country and for defining the future role of the forestry sub-sector in the social and economic development of Nigeria. It may be recalled that the last inventory exercise in Nigeria was conducted about 20 years ago by the Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) and the UNDP. Draft reports of the FRS are now being assessed. It is hoped that a Final Project Completion Workshop will be held by May 1999.
Inventory of the High Forests.
Prior to the inventory of the high forests and plantations, a Preliminary Information Gathering (PIG) exercise was conducted to facilitate stratification of forest types, densities and site characteristics. Geographic Information System (GIS) technology was also used to isolate specific.
forest strata. Stratified Random Sampling (SRS) was used for the high forest inventory. The only limitation imposed for this inventory approach was the requirement to distribute inventory plots across the 14 High Forest States. In other to perform the exercise efficiently, sampling units were taken as point clusters. Each cluster of size 1km by 200 m in area, was composed of two tracts (each of 200 m by 200 m) located 600 m apart at either end of the 1 km line. Within each tract, four plots of 50 m x 50 m were established at the corners to serve as recording unit for the enumeration as shown in Figure.

600 m 1000 m Source: Beak Consultants 1998, Forest Resources Study, draft of main report Vol. II, page 217. Beak Consultants (1998) noted that each cluster, therefore, consisted of 8 plots or enumerating units. Because of the difficult terrain in the Mangrove, Forested Fresh Water swamp and Riparian Forests the size of the cluster was reduced by half i.e. the size of the cluster reduced to 500m x 100m while those of the tract and plot were 100 m x 100 m and 25 m x 25m respectively. The sampling intensity used for inventory of the high Forest was estimated at 0.01% (Beak Consultants 1998).
Inventory of Forest Plantations Beak Consultants (1998) used stratified random sampling to undertake the inventory of forest plantations in the study area. The PIG exercise also facilitated the stratification of plantations according to ecological zones, species, density, soil type and age. In order to satisfy the objectives of this inventory, more plots were established within a plantation to capture variability within than to establish fewer but larger plots. Plots of 0.01 ha were therefore randomly established in selected plantations proportional to the plantation size as shown in Table 5.

Forest Resources Study, Main Report Vol. II page 2 ­ 15. According to Beak Consultants (1998), a total of 958 plots were enumerated each measuring 0.01 ha in size. A total area of 9.58 ha was enumerated thus giving a sampling intensity of approximately 0.01%.
Inventory Results (High Forest).
High Forests Tree volume estimation data were used to estimate the volume of individual trees of the high forest. Several equations were tested but most were derived from the basic one below: ln (Vn) = a + b ln (Hn) + C In (D) Where Vn = net volume Hn = net height D = Diameter (cm) at breast height (dbh, 1.3m) or above buttress. These equations were used to calculate Stand Tables, Stand Volumes, Industrial volumes, Mean annual Increment (MAI) and Annual Allowable cut (AAC).

Standing Volume.
From the FRS, Beak Consultants have developed two types of volume tables for each of the 11 high forest species groups identified from the inventory data. They include double entry (Table 8) and single entry (Table 9) volume tables. The single entry tables are diameter based only while the double entry tables relate diameter to height. It should be noted that these volume tables exclude the bark. Table 10 is the high forest gross volumes (excluding bark) by the forest designation and type.

Inventory Results (Plantations).
Inventory data from plantations in the study area were used to estimate tree volumes of plantations. The processes followed by Beak to accomplish this task include: (a) Preliminary data analysis (b) Data screening (c) Correlation analysis (d) Construction of site index curves (e) Development of site index equations (f) Modelling of volume-Age Relationship and (g) Yield projection models. It is worth noting that only six plantation species were considered for subsequent analysis. These were Gmelina arborea, Tectona grandis, Pinus spp., Eucalyptus spp., Terminalia ivorensis and Nauclea diderrichii. 21.
Stand Volume Table, Major Species.
Stand Volume Tables were developed for each of the six major plantation species. Table 13 depicts the Stand Volume Table for Gmelina arborea.

Forest Resources Management Plans and Maps.
Beak Consultants have identified three types of management units in the high forest areas of the country. These units are based on major forest types, which closely relate to the ecological zones within Nigeria. These management units are designated as follows(a) Lowland rain forest MU1 (b) Fresh water Swamp forest MU2 (c) Mangrove forest MU2 Table 18 is a list of the high forest States with their associated management unit Table 18 ­ High forest states with associated management units.
