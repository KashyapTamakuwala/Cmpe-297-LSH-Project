Foreword
The Cereal Policies Review 1995-97 is the sixth in the series on recent developments in cereal policies. It was launched in response to considerable interest in developments in cereal policies, both at the national and international level. In particular, we have also been encouraged by the favourable reactions received from many readers of the previous issues. We hope that the information provided will continue to be useful to national policy makers, researchers and others concerned with the wider issues of agricultural development and food security.
The first chapter of the document consists of a review of developments in cereal policies over the last two year, based on information available to FAO at the time of writing. The discussion is organized under the following headings: production; consumption; marketing and stocking; international trade and other agricultural policy initiatives. As policy reforms are typically designed in a framework spanning several years and in a sequential way, readers may wish to consult previous issues of this Review in order to identify particular trends in individual country policies.
In general, agricultural policies for cereals can have significant implications for other sectors i.e. oilseeds, livestock, etc.; thus, this issue also contains a review of recent policy developments in the oilseeds sector (Chapter 2) in the same vein as is discussed for cereals, with the hope of identifying the interrelationships between sectoral policies. As in past issues, the third chapter of this document covers an in-depth review of a particular important change in cereal policy, in this case the United States following the enactment of the Federal Agricultural and Improvement (FAIR) Act of 1996.
Any comments and suggestions are welcome. Enquiries and comments on this publication may be sent to: Chief, Basic Foodstuffs Service, Commodities and Trade Division, FAO, Viale delle Terme di Caracalla, 00100 Rome, Italy.

1.1. Introduction
This chapter brings together trends in national cereal policies that were implemented or announced over the period covering August 1995 to July 1997, based on information available to FAO. In general, the policies are broadly categorised by their primary focus, i.e. production; consumption; marketing and stocking; international trade and other agricultural policy programmes.
In both the developed and developing countries, price and non-price market reforms were continued, although the surge in international grain prices during 1995/96 as well as poor crops coupled with tight financial budgets slowed the pace of reform in many countries in that year. At the same time, some countries have introduced measures to target existing or new benefits more effectively. Policy reform has been mostly active in the removal of subsidies on input prices and the privatization of activities previously undertaken by parastatal organizations.

1.2.1. Policies affecting producer prices and incentives in developing countries
In many developing countries, guaranteed producer prices were raised in order to reflect high international grain prices coupled with the effects of drought in some instances, and in order to offset rising input costs, with particular incentives for the use of high yielding seeds. Also, significant changes in land reform policies aimed at preventing the abandonment of land and the elimination of subsidies were important in ensuring greater production efficiency.
In North Africa, producer support prices were strengthened to keep farmers' income in line with inflation. In Algeria, the system of guaranteed producer prices was continued for both durum and common wheat, while retail prices were subjected to a fixed ceiling in 1996. The Government also took measures to raise the official support prices for high-performance seed producers. Registered seed producers received a subsidy of up to half the cost of essential equipment for irrigation. For the purchase of machinery, such as fertilizer-spreaders and sprayers, grants of up to 40 percent and 60 percent were available to individual farmers and co-operatives, respectively. In Egypt, the Government announced its intentions in February 1997 to plant all of upper Egypt's wheat area of 210 000 hectares with super high-yielding varieties within the next two-to-three years. The Government's goal is to raise production to meet 55 percent of domestic wheat requirements. The support price for
the 1997 crop was announced at LE 633 (US$130) per ton, unchanged from 1996.
In May 1996, the Government of Morocco partially liberalised its cereal sector. As an exceptional measure, the Government announced guaranteed minimum producer prices a few weeks after the liberalisation date, which was set high enough to avoid any sharp drop in market prices of grains that would have hurt farmers, already badly hit the year before by the worst drought this century. The new minimum guaranteed price for soft wheat was set at US$289 per ton, and for barley at US$139 per ton. Under its new policy, the Government also fixed the prices for wheat and barley seeds that are mostly produced from irrigated land. Previously, the Government provided a subsidy of 50 dirhams (US$5.8) per ton on planting seeds to help farmers hard hit by drought, but in 1997 no subsidy on cereal seed had been envisaged. Instead, the Government increased wheat seed prices from US$446 per ton (US$452 for durum) in 1996 to US$452 per ton (US$471 for durum) in 1997, but reduced the barley seed
price from US$347 per ton in 1996 to US$330 per ton in 1997.
In Tunisia, as a result of two successive years of drought, the guaranteed producer prices for the 1995 wheat crop was increased by 15 dinars per ton to 275 dinars (US$192) per ton for durum, and for common wheat from 225 dinars (US$157) to 240 dinars per ton (US$167).
In 1996, the Government of Zimbabwe lifted the producer price of wheat by 44.8 percent. This unusually high increase was to ensure adequate supplies of wheat in the next season following a drought which had severely damaged most of the 1996 wheat crop, reflecting the higher cost of imports and stabilizing farmers' income. In addition, the government embarked on a loan scheme of Z$132 million ($US13.2 million) during the 1995/96 season, whereby farmers were provided with seeds and fertilizers to be repaid in kind from their grain harvest. For the 1996/97 season, government assistance was reduced to Z$75 million ($US7.5 million).
In South America, the Government of Brazil increased its allocation of farm credits from US$3.7 billion in 1995/96 to US$5.7 billion in 1996/97. The Government also plans to invest US$54 billion over two years (1996-97) to improve road, storage and port facilities. Ten billion dollars of the planned investment would be provided by the Government and the rest by the private sector.
In Asia, the Government of China decided in 1996 to implement a system requiring enterprises to deposit a sum of money for land purchases in order to make abandonment of land more difficult. Of the abandoned area, 60 to 70 percent was for agricultural purposes, and much was high yielding. The State Land Administration set a target of about 80 percent of the abandoned land to be reclaimed, which would generate an additional 28 million tons of grain each year. In early 1997, several provincial governments introduced a grain procurement price scheme to ensure that farmers receive fair prices when market prices are lower than the guaranteed prices set by the central authority. In India, rising input costs led the Government to fix the minimum support price for the 1996 summer wheat crop of average quality at 3 800 Rupees (US$110) per ton, up 20 rupees over the previous year. For the 1997 crop, the price was initially increased to 4 150 Rupees (US$116) per ton. As an incentive
for producers to sell their crop to the Food Cooperation of India, an addition 600 Rupees (US$17) was earmarked, thus raising the total official price to 4 750 Rupees (US$133) per ton. This new price was effective until early June 1997, after which it reverted to its previous level. In Indonesia, anticipating higher demand for rice in 1995/96, the Government announced a plan to reclaim up to 1 million hectares of marshland for rice cultivation. To further encourage production, the Government raised the purchase price for rice by 12.5 percent to 450 Rupiah (US$0.19) per kilogram in February 1996. In Pakistan, the Government lifted the minimum purchase price for wheat in 1996 as an incentive measure to expand deliveries of wheat by producers affected by a decline in planted area. The minimum support price for wheat, initially set 5 Rupees (US$0.09) higher at 165 Rupees per 40 kilograms (US$72 per ton) in 1995, was further increased in 1996 to 175 Rupees per 40 kilograms (US$76
per ton). Also, the price of wheat sold from the Government reserves to millers was raised from 180 Rupees in 1995 to 190 Rupees per 40 kilograms (US$78 to US$82 per ton).
In Saudi Arabia, for the first time since 1984, the Government decided in June 1995 to reduce the guaranteed procurement price of wheat by 25 percent largely as a result of budgetary constraints. At the same time, procurement quotas were announced to limit wheat production to the self-sufficiency level of around 1.8 million tons by 1996/97. These measures led to lower production and, as a result, wheat exports from Saudi Arabia dropped sharply in 1995/96. Furthermore, in November 1996, the Saudi Government announced that it would continue its reimbursement of outstanding payments to producers of wheat and barley delivered during 1995, totaling 9 billion Riyal (US$2.3 billion).
The Government of Turkey, in a move aimed at encouraging the replenishment of its depleted stocks of cereals, set support prices for 1995/96 above those of the previous year, but still below those currently prevailing in the market. The base support prices for common wheat ranged from TL 5 950 (US$0.073) to TL 7 350 (US$0.09) per kilogram, depending on quality, and those for durum at TL 10 150 (US$0.12) to TL 11 200 (US$0.14) per kilogram. The higher quality barley support price was set at TL 5 250 (US$0.06) per kilogram. To help avoiding higher support prices being passed on to retail prices and hence to the consumers, the rate of the value added tax (VAT) on both wheat flour and bread products was reduced from 8 percent to 1 percent. The Government also decided to raise support prices for white milling wheat in the marketing year 1996/97 by over 157 percent as a production incentive.
1.2.2. Policy initiatives in developed countries
A number of new policy initiatives came into force during the 1995-97 period covered in this section. Reforms were made as part of commitments under the Uruguay Round Agreement (URA) continued with several new measures enacted. Cereal support prices were continued in many countries and area set-aside policies revised. In countries where state trading predominated, several parastals were privatised along with revisions in the functions of state trading boards. Incentives were also provided by some countries in the form of higher premiums for the improvements in cereal quality.
In Australia, farmers, especially wheat growers, received record payments from the Australian Wheat Board (AWB) in 1995/96. In February 1995, the AWB's first estimate of the pool prices for Australian Standard White (ASW) wheat delivered in 1995/96 was A$124 (US$99) per ton. By June 1995 this was raised to A$130 (US$104) and by February 1996 to A$180 (US$143) per ton, some 45 percent higher than the first estimate a year earlier. Also, reflecting a continuing increase in international wheat prices, the first estimate of harvest payments for ASW wheat to be delivered to the 1996/97 pools was A$152 (US$121), the highest ever made at the beginning of the season. Table 1 summarises pool harvest payments between the 1994/95 and 1996/97 crop seasons.
Furthermore, the Government revised its Wheat Marketing Act, which in the past left wheat-pricing pools open for several years after harvest. Under the new programme, which started in 1996/97, the AWB can make advance payments on wheat delivered to the pools and decide the size and timing of those payments, although all wheat pools are to be closed approximately 18 months after harvest. Also, farmers may opt to deliver their grains to a pool offering 40 percent of the expected pool return within 21 days after delivery and a further 50 percent during the month of August. This option would enable the AWB to save on interest payments, which would then be passed on to growers who have chosen this option. This revision would last for three years so that the programme can be assessed in terms of its compatibility with the Uruguay Round Agreement. The AWB also adopted a policy of segregating weather-damaged grains and to reduce their premiums. Under this policy, Australian Prime
Hard 5 will carry a discount of A$35 (US$28) below Prime Hard, and for Hard 6, a discount of A$10 (US$8) below Australian Hard.
Also, the AWB introduced a new wheat class, know as Australian Premium White (APW), that consists of varieties of the Australian Standard White (ASW) but with superior milling and end-product characteristics. In 1995/96, the premium for this new wheat variety was at least A$5.00 (US$4) per ton above that for ASW 10 percent protein. Furthermore, as a result of internal market deregulation in 1996, the Australian Government cut payments under the Tasmanian Wheat Freight Subsidy Scheme by about 50 percent to A$1.2 million (US$940 000) a year.

As reported in the previous issue of this Review^1 the Government of Canada eliminated the annual railway subsidy under the Western Grain Transportation Act (WGTA) in August 1995. To help Canadian producers compete in the export market, credit guarantees of up to C$1 000 million (US$730 million) were granted for the exports of grains and other food products to offshore and private sector buyers. Also, the Feed Freight Assistance (FFA) transportation subsidy was eliminated in 1995 with compensation payments of C$72 million (US$53 million) disbursed over five years to eligible producers to help offset their losses. The fund is to be divided among the affected provinces and territories in proportion to their use of the FFA between 1990 and 1995. The Gross Revenue Insurance Plan (GRIP), which was in operation until 1994/95, was terminated in the 1995/96 crop year and only the province of Ontario is operating a similar programme for the 1996-97 crop year. As a result of the
termination of this programme, only about 6 percent of the total Canadian cereal area is now covered by the GRIP. More recently, new legislation, the Agricultural Marketing Programs Act (AMPA), came into force on April 25, 1997. This Act combined the provisions of four separate pieces of legislation: the Advance Payments for Crops Act (APCA), the Prairie Grain Advance Payments Act (PGAPA), the Agricultural Products Cooperative Marketing Act and the Agricultural Products Board Act. The AMPA also includes provisions for interest free loans to producers on the first C$50 000 (US$37 000) of advances issued to them under the APCA and PGAPA, which were previously provided through the Cash Flow Enhancement Program.
^1 Cereal Policies Review, 1994-95.
The Canadian Wheat Board (CWB) introduced in August 1995 new protein categories for wheat. This was in response to quality requirements from buyers of Canadian wheat, and to provide the CWB a better way to determine accurately its price policy and payments to producers. For Nos. 1 and 2 Canadian Red Spring (CWRS) wheat, additional payments were made for each 0.5 percent increase in protein content above 12 percent, to a maximum of 15 percent. For Nos. 1 and 2 Canadian Western Amber Durum (CWAD), the extra payments will apply to each 0.5 percent increase in protein content above 12 percent, to a maximum of 14 percent.
The European Community announced in October 1995 its new set-aside for the 1996/97 season at 10 percent, following a surge in domestic prices and a sharp decline in public grain stocks, which had plummeted to six million tons in 1995 from an average of 33 million tons over the previous three years. This single rate replaced the previous 10 percent rotational and the 17 percent non-rotational set-aside rates that were in effect in 1995/96 (except in Denmark and the UK, where the old single rate was 15 percent). For the 1997/98 season, the Commission decided to reduce the mandatory set-aside to 5 percent, but keeping arable aid and set-aside payments the same as in the 1996/97 season.
On 30 July 1996, the EC Commission submitted to the Council of Ministers a new proposal to reform the regime for durum wheat. This new package would set production quotas for each of the traditional durum producing countries and enforce the use of certified seed so as to improve the overall durum quality. The proposal targets three million hectares of land in the traditional producing countries, distributed as follows (in thousands of hectares); Italy 1 610, Greece 597, Spain 570, France 190 and Portugal 35. The proposal provides for each producer to receive a premium in accordance with the total durum area allotted rather than the subsidy per hectare of 359 ECUs (US$353) under the previous scheme.
Furthermore, in 1997, the Commission presented a new Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) reform proposal as part of a broader reform package in its Agenda 2000. For cereals, the proposal calls for a 20 percent reduction in the intervention prices in the year 2000. The main highlights of the proposals relating to cereals, which are currently being debated, are presented in Box 1.
In Japan, the Government reduced the prices paid by millers for domestic and imported wheat in February 1996 by 2.1 percent to an average price of US$485 per ton in order to lessen the impact of higher international prices on consumers. The Government also announced a revision to its rice diversion programme in April 1996 to reduce carryover stocks to 1.5 million tons from the previous level of 2.2 million tons. This programme will continue until 1999 with a targeted diversion of 870 000 hectares, which, according to official sources, could result in a projected harvest of 9.6 million tons of paddy by 1998 compared to 12.9 million tons in 1996.
BOX 1: Agenda 2000: The European Commission's New CAP Reform Proposals for Cereals
1. Intervention Price
The cereal intervention price would be reduced by 20 percent (24 ECUs) in the year 2000, from the present level of 119.19 ECUs to 95.35 ECUs per ton.
2. Decoupling of Payments
Area payments would not be crop specific, except for durum, with the intention of further delinking payments from production decisions. The cereal aid payments would be raised by 12 ECUs to 66 ECUs per ton (but would fall by about 118 ECUs for oilseeds), partially off-setting the 24 ECUs fall in the intervention support price for cereals. Furthermore, there would be a mechanism to avoid overcompensation in the event of high market prices. By contrast, oilseeds and protein payments would be reduced (see table below).
3. Set-Aside
The reference rate of set-aside would be reduced to zero. The revised provisions would allow the option of voluntary set-aside, but payments would be less than their current levels.
4. Protein Crop Payments
An additional payment is proposed for protein crops, at 6.5 ECUs per ton, in order to preserve their competitiveness with cereals. This would effectively make the protein aid payments crop-specific.
5. Exclusion of Silage Cereal
The Commission has also proposed to exclude silage cereals (notably maize silage) from the cereal support arrangements.

In Central and Eastern Europe, producer support prices were increased in several countries to offset the rise in input costs and to reflect high international prices for grain. In 1996, the Government of Bulgaria, in a move to avoid a sharp increase in the retail price of bread, set a new range of minimum official purchase prices for wheat in 1996 at 6 200 Lev (US$85) to 7 400 Lev (US$101) per ton, depending on crop quality. This represents an increase of between 42-48 percent from the prices in 1995. In addition, the Agricultural Support Fund made payments to private wheat purchasing companies totaling 933 million Lev (US$12 million) to help them defray expenditures on rents, diesel fuel and interest payments. To raise funds for the 1997 autumn sowing, the Government, in late 1996, authorized the sale of 150 000 tons of grain in the futures market. The proceeds from the sale were used as an advance payment to farmers of 5 000 Lev (US$68) per ton. The Agricultural Support
Fund also provided credit to farmers of 35 000 Lev (US$479) per ton. Under this scheme, farmers had to plant grain on at least 3.5 hectares of land and they had to sell their grain to the State.
In the Czech Republic, as a result of the equalization of the international and domestic grain prices, the Government, in late 1996, decided to discontinue its advanced payment scheme for bread grains which amounted to 686 million Koruna (US$25 million) in 1996. However, the Support and Guarantee Fund, which offered lower interest rates on loans than those charged by commercial banks, provided some funding to grain farmers during the first half of 1997.
In early 1996, the Agricultural Marketing Agency of Poland, responding to sharp increases in world and domestic market prices for grain, set the minimum purchase price for the 1996/97 wheat crop at 400 Zlotys (US$158) per ton. This reflected a rise of about 27 percent from the previous season's 315 Zlotys (US$119) per ton, while the rye price was raised from 200 Zlotys (US$79) to 280 Zlotys (US$111) per ton, an increase of about 40 percent.
In Romania, the Government raised the minimum wheat purchase price by around 9 percent in local currency in 1996, a small increase compared to inflation. Due to a rise in the cost of inputs, the number of producers under contract with the government fell rapidly, despite the previously announced 41 percent increase in the 1996/97 minimum purchase prices. Also, grain producing enterprises in which the State has a majority interest were obliged to deliver their entire output to the state trading agency at the minimum purchase price which was increased further by 78 percent from 240 Leu (US$0.09) to 450 Leu (US$0.16) per kilogram. In February 1997, the Government announced plans to lift controls on agricultural producer support prices during the period from March to the end of August 1997. To carry out this and other agricultural reform schemes, the Government received credits valued at US$200 million from the World Bank. In addition, the Ministry of Finance in early 1997
proposed a new law to defer agricultural taxes for a period of three years, commencing in 1997, in order to relieve farmers of their financial burden.
In early 1996, the Government of Slovenia outlined its purchasing procedure for wheat and rye for the 1995/96 crop year so as to enable timely adjustments for inflation. The purchase price for wheat of average quality was set at 28.93 Tolars (US$0.21) per kilogram and for rye at 27 Tolars (US$0.20) per kilogram. During the harvesting period, the prices were adjusted to 80 percent of the established inflation rate for the period from April to June 1996, with producers receiving payments within 30 days after the results of a quality analysis had been submitted to the Government.
In the Russian Federation, the Government increased guaranteed prices for federal purchases of grains for the 1996/97 harvest. The new prices, which came into effect on 1 July 1996, were indexed to keep abreast of inflation. For durum wheat (Class III), the price was set at 1 000 000 Roubles (US$213) per ton, while that for soft wheat of the same class was set at 850 000 Roubles (US$181) per ton, more than doubling the prices (in local currency) of the previous season.
In the Republic of South Africa, the Wheat Board, in its bid to ensure adequate supplies of wheat, increased the producer delivery price for utility and feed grades of wheat in 1995/96 from 360.33 Rand (US$54) to 500 Rand (US$74) per ton, which reflected a sharp rise in domestic market prices since the guaranteed level was fixed at the beginning of the season.
In Switzerland, long-term policy reforms, which were under consideration in 1996, were expected to come into force in 1997, subject to parliamentary approval. The reforms are aimed at liberalizing producer prices, which are currently fixed by the Government. Producer income losses as a result of this shift in policy would be compensated by direct payments on the basis of cultivated area. Under this long-term reform, by the year 2002, farmers would be able to sell their crops directly to mills or cereal traders rather than to the State, which currently purchases all domestically produced wheat and rye at guaranteed prices. Mills would also be free to buy either on the local market or abroad at ruling prices and according to their quality requirements. Guidelines for domestic prices of bread and feedgrains would be negotiated to reflect market conditions. In addition, custom duties would be set so as to maintain the negotiated prices on the local market. The Government
estimated that this reform would result in a 40 percent decline in the producer price of bread grain by the year 2002.
On 4 April 1996, the FAIR Act was signed into law in the United States covering agriculture for the seven-year period 1996-2002. With regard to cereals, the main changes under this new legislation include the elimination of area set-aside programmes and the replacement of support and deficiency payments with diminishing levels of income transfer payments. A detailed account of the new law is presented in Chapter 2 of this Review.
1.3. Marketing and stocking policy
Reform toward market liberalization continued in most countries. The governments of some major wheat exporting countries announced proposals that are still under consideration to revise the roles of their parastatal grain boards, while state control of the domestic market was liberalized in a number of countries.
In Brazil, as a result of the doubling of its wheat output from 1.5 million tons in 1995 to 3 million tons in 1996, the Government enacted a new pricing system to encourage the consumption of domestically produced wheat and to relieve the Government of storage costs. Under this new system, which was originally limited to 640 000 tons, millers would receive a bonus of up to 37 Real (US$36) per ton when they bought domestic wheat at the minimum guaranteed price of 157 Real (US$151) per ton.
As a result of a drop in maize prices below the support price of 6.70 Real (US$6.45) per 60-kilogram sack for the 1996/97 crop year, the Government intervened in the market in February 1996 with two financial programmes to support prices. These included: (i) an initial release of 19 million Real (US$18.3 million) to purchase maize from the Centre-South region; and (ii) an additional release of 21 million Real (US$20.2 million) for a purchase programme, under which the Government takes physical possession of the grain. These two programmes enabled the Government to buy up to 350 000 tons of maize. In March 1997, the Government decided to further intervene in the maize market by purchasing 200 000 tons from small farmers, costing some 120 million Real (US$115 million). Producers were also provided with debt relief by allowing them to repay old loans in kind, and maize processors were given credit to reduce the cost of holding stocks and to stimulate exports.
In 1996, the Government of Honduras introduced a programme to purchase privately held stocks of grains in order to release them through local governments at subsidized prices.
In November 1996, the Indian Government released 800 000 tons of wheat from its official reserves in a move to stabilize domestic wheat prices and to ensure supplies to low income households. Eligible persons were able to purchase up to 10 kilograms of food grains monthly at subsidized prices.
In Morocco, under the market reform policy announced in May 1996, farmers may sell their wheat in the free market but have the option to sell to Government licensed collectors and get the minimum guaranteed prices. In order to encourage licensed collectors to purchase local grains, the Government provided 40 dirhams per ton per month (US$4.63 per ton) bonus for storage for the period running from June through November 1996, for grain purchased prior to 31 August 1996. However, most grain collectors had purchased local wheat at higher prices than the minimum guaranteed prices offered by the Government prior to the announced change in policy.
In early 1997, the Rice Policy Committee of Thailand approved measures to stabilize paddy rice prices of the 1996/97 crop, although the export subsidy of US$10 per ton, which was introduced in 1994/95, had been removed in view of rising world market prices. Under the new measures, the Department of Agricultural Co-operatives was authorized to purchase one billion Baht (US$40 million) worth of paddy rice to be milled by co-operative mills and sold within the country. Additional funds were also made available to purchase up to one million tons of milled rice to act as a buffer against a sharp decline in prices. The Government, in addition, granted credit to exporters and millers, worth 20 billion Baht (US$790 million) for the packaging of rice.
In April 1997, the Australian Government announced revisions to the role and structure of the AWB. A new grower-owned and controlled holding company will replace the statutory AWB and will be responsible for all commercial aspects of the marketing of wheat. The Wheat Industry Fund (WIF), which is currently financed by a 2 percent levy on wheat sales, will be converted into shares to provide the capital for the new holding company's operation commencing in 1999. Wheat farmers with equity in the WIF will be given "A" class shares and these will carry voting rights to elect the majority of directors of the new company. Equity investors in the new company will be given "B" class shares, on which they will receive a commercial rate of return, and will be entitled to elect a minority of the company's directors. Export sales will be conducted by a wheat pooling/export subsidiary, which will maintain the monopoly status of the current AWB. A subsidiary of the new company will be
responsible for all other commercial aspects of domestic wheat marketing.
In 1996, the Government of Canada proposed several amendments to the Canadian Wheat Board Act (which have not yet been legislated on) as part of a reform package that had been debated for some time. The main highlights of the proposed changes are presented in Box 2.
In the Czech Republic, in spite of the good wheat harvest in 1996/97 amounting to 3.7 million tons, the Czech Fund for Market Regulation had difficulties in procuring the 600 000 tons of wheat it had contracted with farmers earlier in the season. The Fund needed to procure wheat to replenish its working stocks as well as the state emergency reserves from which it borrowed earlier in the year. Recent reports indicate that by early 1997 the Fund had bought only a small percentage of the contracted amount. The main reason for the shortfall were the reluctance of farmers to sell wheat to the State when they could get better prices on the open market and the difficulty in meeting quality standards set by the Fund, d
