<title>A Review of Measures Taken by Regional Marine Fishery Bodies to Address </title>
<section>1</section>
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Since the early 1990s, the international community has adopted a number of instruments to enhance and develop the legal framework for fisheries management as laid down in the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (1982 Convention). Such instruments include the 1992 Rio Declaration and Agenda 21 adopted by the United Nations Conference on the Environment and Development; the 1993 Agreement to Promote Compliance with International Conservation and Management Measures by Fishing Vessels on the High Seas (Compliance Agreement), the 1995 Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries (Code of Conduct); the 1995 Rome Consensus on World Fisheries;^ the 1995 Kyoto Declaration and Plan of Action on the Sustainable Contribution of Fisheries to Food Security (Kyoto Declaration and Plan of Action); and the 1995 Agreement for the Implementation of the Provision of the United Nations Convention of the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 Relating to the Conservation and Management
of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stock (UN Fish Stocks Agreement).^.
Contemporary fishery issues referred to in these instruments include, in particular, excess fleet capacity; by-catch and discards; monitoring, control and surveillance (MCS) of fishing vessels; measures to enhance data collection; and application of the precautionary approach.
The purpose of this paper is to analyse the extent to which the above mentioned instruments have, or have not, generally been implemented by, or incorporated in the activities of six FAO and twenty-two non-FAO regional fishery bodies (RFBs) or arrangements. The information, for this specific aspect of the review is based on replies received from the Secretariats of regional fishery bodies, the Annual Reports of the bodies and FAO publications, as appropriate.
The 1982 Convention provides only a few references to the subject of "regional cooperation" in the context of fisheries management. In comparison, the later instruments listed above, provide an increasing number of references to, and a progressively important role for, RFBs, in the conservation and management of fish stocks. In fact, RFBs should now be viewed as critical to the realization of sustainable utilization of world marine capture fisheries.
From the terminology used in the post 1982 Convention instruments, it is important to distinguish between an onus for conservation and management being placed upon the States which comprise RFBs, and the RFBs themselves. It must be recalled that RFBs are not supra-national. They are only as strong and effective as their Members make them. In spite of this fact, many Governments have proven slow to tackle the issue of fisheries reform. There are two main reasons for this:
* benefits are slow to appear and do so only after considerable costs have been incurred for some time; and
* individuals who incur the costs are seldom convinced that they will reap the benefits, and so they resist what they perceive to be a re-distribution of their income.
At present, there are three critical issues facing those responsible for the conservation and management of world marine capture fisheries. These are:
* the problem of over fishing - including the use of insufficiently selective gear which leads to waste in the form of by-catch and discard;
* poor monitoring, control and surveillance (MCS) of vessels in both zones of national jurisdiction and on the high seas - including the problem of reflagging to avoid compliance with international conservation and management measures, and the need for better flag and port State controls; and
* environmental degradation of fish habitats.
To the extent that the law, as opposed to education, science, economics or politics, can provide solutions to these problems, significant progress has been made by the 1982 Convention, and the subsequent international fishery instruments.
The instruments impose specific duties or responsibilities upon both RFBs and their respective members. With regards to unregulated fishing; over capitalization of fleets; excessive fleet size; insufficiently selective fishing gear; by-catch and discards; unreliable data and statistics. Other issues addressed include the use of the precautionary approach; conservation and management of high seas fish stocks; MCS and enforcement by flag and port States; marine pollution; ecosystem protection; data gathering and subsequent management advice; and assistance to developing States.
RFBs should view these post-1982 Convention instruments as providing a checklist that would enable them to effectively fulfil a management role by addressing the critical issues enumerated above and discussed in the body of this document.
The review indicates that very few bodies have started to implement the conservation and management measures provided for in the post-1982 fishery instruments. This conclusion is perhaps not surprising. The instruments present complex scientific, managerial and political considerations that cannot be resolved quickly. Furthermore, the implementation of many of these requirements for RFBs may require amendment of the RFB's constituting agreement. In many cases, the original terms of reference or mandates were constructed in an era pre-dating the post-1982 instruments. From information made available to FAO, only two RFBs are acting to amend their mandates in order to allow them to implement the above mentioned requirements. However, most RFBs are examining the post-1982 instruments, and considering, through appropriately constituted working groups, the consequences of, and steps necessary for, implementation of the instruments.
The result of this state of affairs is that despite international expectations for RFBs to take effective measures to conserve and manage marine capture fisheries, there is little facility for this to occur unless their roles and functions are strengthened as presented in these fishery instruments. In other words, the strenghtening of regional fisheries management must be addressed in a more comprehensive and rational manner if sustainable resource utilization is to be achieved. This is important because under existing international law, and within the current paradigm for the management of straddling, highly migratory and high seas fish stocks, RFBs provide the only realistic mechanism for the enhanced international cooperation in their conservation and management.

I. INTRODUCTION
Background
Over the past 2000 years the international community has lived by a customary law of sea fisheries. Some custom has favoured a freedom of fishing approach, while other custom has attempted a theoretical and/or practical control of the industry. Only in the twentieth century has there been concern with attempting to reach a universally accepted code of regulation for fisheries. This has been part of a broader movement towards codifying the whole law of the sea. The 1982 United Nations Law of the Sea Convention (hereafter referred to as the 1982 Convention) represents the attainment of that goal.
The 1982 Convention came into effect on the 16th November 1994. It deals with a comprehensive range of subjects contained in 320 articles, plus nine annexes. The Convention deals with subjects that have not been comprehensively raised before in international law. Such subjects include, inter alia, the exclusive economic zone (EEZ), the rights and jurisdiction of the coastal State, conservation and management of the living resources of the high seas, maximum sustainable yield (hereafter referred to as MSY) and optimum utilisation, and the establishment of regional fishery bodies (hereinafter referred to as RFBs) for the conservation and management of transboundary and highly migratory stocks.
Despite its magnanimous principles of conservation and environmental protection, the negotiation of the 1982 Convention could not change the fact that by the time it came into force in 1994, some 70 percent of the world's marine capture fisheries were fully exploited, over-exploited or in a state of recovery. In the interests of food security and the contribution made to feeding an increasing global population by the fishery sector, better management of marine capture fisheries had to be addressed.
Throughout the 1990s the international community made several attempts to enhance and develop the legal framework for fisheries management described in the 1982 Convention. Such negotiations have included the 1992 Rio Declaration on Environment and Development (Rio Declaration) and Agenda 21: The United Nations Programme of Action (Agenda 21), adopted by the United Nations Conference on the Environment and Development (UNCED), the 1993 Agreement to Promote Compliance with International Conservation and Measurement Measures by Fishing Vessels on the High Seas (Compliance Agreement), the 1995 Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries (Code of Conduct); the 1995 Rome Consensus on World Fisheries, and the 1995 Agreement for the Implementation of the Provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 Relating to the Conservation and Management of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks (UN Fish Stocks Agreement), and the 1995
Kyoto Declaration and Plan of Action on the Sustainable Contribution of Fisheries to Food Security.
Purpose
The purpose of this report is to examine the extent to which the 1982 Convention, and the above mentioned 1990s agreements for fisheries, have or have not, been implemented by RFBs. The report is a review and analysis of recent steps taken, and measures implemented, by RFBs to comply with the current international legal regime for fisheries.

* Western Central Atlantic Fishery Commission (WECAFC) (Article VI)
* Indian Ocean Fishery Commission (IOFC) (Article VI)
* Asia-Pacific Fisheries Commission (APFIC) (Article XIV)
* General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM) (Article XIV)

Structure of the Report
The report is divided into five chapters.
The introductory first chapter provides an outline for, and the significance of, the report.
Chapter II examines the evolution of the contemporary legal regime relating to international fisheries. This requires an analysis of the fishery related provisions within the 1982 Convention, plus a description of those subsequent international conventions and instruments which have developed the fisheries provisions of the 1982 Convention. Specific reference is given to: Agenda 21, the Compliance Agreement, the Code of Conduct, the UN Fish Stocks Agreement, the Rome Consensus on World Fisheries, and the Kyoto Declaration and Plan of Action on the Sustainable Contribution of Fisheries to Food Security.
Of particular relevance to this report, Chapter II notes the provisions within the international conventions and instruments that describe an obligation and/or a role for RFBs in the conservation and management of marine capture fisheries.
Chapter III considers the modern evolution, philosophy and purpose of RFBs from the 1902 establishment of ICES. With regard to RFBs discussed in this report, this chapter describes the following information for each body:
* Area of Competence;
* Terms of Reference;
* Current Membership, including (where the information has been made available) financial contributions and degree of membership participation;
* Current Considerations;
* Data Supply and Disclosure;
* Dispute/Conflict Resolution Mechanisms; and
* Future Role.
The information for this chapter has been based partly on correspondence received directly from the RFBs, plus RFB Annual Reports and FAO publications, where appropriate.
Chapter IV combines the legal framework data of Chapter II and the RFB descriptions of Chapter III in an evaluation of the contemporary fishery management practices of RFBs. Specifically, those subjects which have been addressed by the 1990s fisheries instruments, and described in Chapter II, including fleet capacity, fishing gear, use of vessel monitoring systems (VMS), application of the precautionary approach, and improved data collection and dissemination, are used as the means for evaluating the extent to which RFBs have taken steps, or not taken steps, to enhance fisheries management. This evaluation is again based on information provided by RFBs and information from other published sources.
Chapter V concludes and summarises the report.

II. THE 1982 UNITED NATIONS LAW OF THE SEA CONVENTION AND SUBSEQUENT DEVELOPMENTS IN INTERNATIONAL FISHERIES LAW
THE FISHERIES REGIME WITHIN THE 1982 CONVENTION
The core provisions of the fisheries regime in the 1982 Convention are contained in the Part V provisions dealing with the Exclusive Economic Zone (i.e. Articles 55-75). The Grotian concept of freedom of fishing on the high seas is maintained by Article 87, Paragraph 1(e). This is so despite the fact that frequent suggestions were made during the course of the Conference to delete freedom of fishing from the list of high seas freedoms. Eventually it was included, but made subject to conditions concerning conservation and management of the living resources of the high seas. There are a further five articles (Article 116-120) which describe the status of high seas fisheries. Of particular importance to this Report, Articles 61 and 119 of the Convention provide for cooperation in fisheries conservation and management through competent sub-regional, regional or global organizations. Finally, it should be noted that in Article 73, the Convention makes provision for the
enforcement of these fishing laws by prosecution and imposition of penalties. This Report proposes to discuss some of the more controversial fishery provisions within the 1982 Convention.
Article 61
Article 61 of the 1982 Convention is titled "Conservation of the Living Resources". The effect of its five sub-paragraphs is to give responsibility to the coastal State for determining "the allowable catch of the living resources in its exclusive economic zone". This is to be done by "proper conservation and management measures" determined by cooperating with competent subregional, regional or global international organizations. The irony of this provision is that despite the clear importance of conservation and management in the new legal regime for fisheries, the 1982 Convention makes no attempt to define what the term means.
The lack of definition given to both "conservation" and "management" is a significant omission when it is remembered that some developed States initially opposed the concept of a two hundred mile exclusive economic zone and were eventually persuaded to support the concept if, inter alia, the conservation and management of fishery resources were made an essential ingredient of the 1982 Convention.
Article 62
Article 62 of the 1982 Convention deals with utilization of living resources based on capacity to harvest and allocation of the surplus of the allowable catch. Like MSY, the term "optimum utilization" used in paragraph (1) was already viewed as an anachronism by many environmentalists in 1982. The preferred expression, later given international recognition in the forthcoming Report of the World Commission on Environment and Development, Our Common Future (the Brundtland Report) was for "sustainable development".
Article 63
Article 63 (2) deals with stocks or stocks of associated species which occur both within the EEZ and in area beyond and adjacent to the zone. In respect of such stocks, the coastal State and States fishing for such stocks in the adjacent area are required to seek, either directly or through appropriate subregional or regional organizations, to agree upon the measures necessary for the conservation of these stocks in the adjacent area. It should be noted that the objective here is merely to cooperate in the "conservation"of these stocks, whereas in the case of stocks that occur within the EEZ's of two or more coastal States, the obligation under Art 63 (1) is to agree on measures necessary for the "conservation and development" of these stocks.
Article 64
Article 64 of the 1982 Convention deals with Highly Migratory Species which are defined as those species listed in Annex I of the Convention. Again, the political sensitivities of drafting the Convention prohibited elaboration on an ambiguous issue that was to remain controversial for many years. This was the question of the extent to which the coastal State had sovereign rights over these species within the EEZ, and the extent to which the obligation to cooperate with a view to ensuring conservation and promoting the objective of optimum utilisation of such species throughout the region, both within and beyond the EEZ, limited the sovereign rights of the coasatal State.
Other legal and management issues left unresolved by Article 64 where it set out a duty to cooperate concerned the lack of regulatory bodies with a capacity to make binding decisions, and what to do about non-complying States, whether members or otherwise, of any such bodies.
Articles 116-120
Articles 116-120 of the 1982 Convention deal with the conservation and management of living resources of the high seas. Many of the legal ambiguity criticisms which have been made against other provisions of the Convention can also be extended to the high seas fishery regime. Thus, what is meant by "cooperation of States" in Article 118; how is "conservation and management of living resources" (also in Article 118) to be achieved; the incompleteness of Article 119(1) provisions on determination of the allowable catch; what is meant by procedures that "do not discriminate" against fishers of a State in Article 119(3).
The provisions are a qualification to the freedom of high seas fishing provided for in Article 87(1)(e) of the 1982 Convention. Their effect is that they impose a dual duty on States engaged in distant water fishing. That is, they must conserve stocks, and cooperate with adjacent coastal States in the harvest of such stocks. However, both the 1982 Convention, and the earlier 1958 High Seas Fishery Convention fail to address the subject of how best to allocate the living resources amongst the potential and actual competing users. Further, the problem of how best to monitor and survey the high seas catches of distant water fishing nations is similarly unaddressed.
SUMMARY EVALUATION OF THE 1982 CONVENTION
The 1982 Convention dealt with subjects that had not been comprehensively raised before in international law. Such subjects include, inter alia, the EEZ, the rights and jurisdiction of coastal States, conservation and management of living resources, and harvesting by maximum sustainable yield and optimum utilization. As these concepts were new, there was ambiguity and uncertainty over both their literal and legal definitions.
Despite the 1982 Convention's central principle of conservation, it could not succeed in addressing the fact that by 1994, when the Convention came into effect, some seventy per cent of the world's marine capture fisheries were fully exploited, over-exploited or in a State of recovery. The problem of overfishing was particularly problematic with regard to high seas fish stocks, straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks, where the 1982 Convention provided an inadequate legal and management regime.
The basic problem which confronted the international community at the completion of the 1982 Convention, and today, is the same problem that confronts all aspects of environmental development (such as mining and forestry). That is, how, after centuries of freely exploiting the environment, are we to equitably balance competing demands for access to resources with an appropriate level of environmental protection?
This is a difficult problem to overcome, and possible solutions are beyond the realm of mere fisheries law. In the aftermath of the 1982 Convention, it was necessary for the international community of States to address the following issues:
* provision of legal definitions for certain unclear or outdated words and terms;
* offer a structure and process for the management of Article 63 Straddling Stocks and Article 64 Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in accordance with the 1982 Convention;
* obtain compliance with the law on the part of domestic and foreign fishers. It is apparent that many fishers view the law as an obstacle to be overridden (illegally if necessary), rather than as an effective management policy of which they are both the guardians and the beneficiaries. Specific problems include fleet capacity, by-catch and discard fishing practices, and reflagging of fishing vessels; and
* enforcement of the legal regime. This includes monitoring, control and surveillance of vessels, and data collection regarding catch and effort.
The subsequent international instruments which aimed to address these issues are the subject of the remainder of this chapter.
AGENDA 21 - UNITED NATIONS CONFERENCE ON ENVIRONMENT AND DEVELOPMENT
In 1989 the United Nations General Assembly called for a global meeting to devise integrated strategies that would halt and reverse the negative impact of human behaviour on the physical environment, and promote environmentally long-term sustainable economic development in all countries. Ultimately, the 1992 Earth Summit produced the Rio Declaration, a Statement of principles on forests, two international conventions: one on Biodiversity and one on Climate Change, and a blueprint for action to be taken globally from the early 1990s into the 21st Century, known as Agenda 21. Both the Rio Declaration and Agenda 21 were negotiated by a preparatory commission which met on four occasions between 1990 and 1992. Neither the Rio Declaration, nor Agenda 21 is legally binding, but as the UNCED was attended by more than 178 heads of government, deputy heads of government, or ranking government ministers, the Agreements carry a strong moral obligation that States will comply with the
principles and implement the provisions.
Chapter 17 of Agenda 21 specifically deals with protection of the oceans, the seas, coastal areas, and the rational use and development of marine living resources. Paragraph 17.1 describes the 1982 Convention as law which provides the international basis upon which to pursue the protection and sustainable development of marine resources. The paragraph goes on to note that this requires new approaches to marine and coastal area management and development at national, subregional, regional and global levels. Further, such "new approaches" should be integrated, precautionary and anticipatory.
In Program Area C of Chapter 17, recognition is given to the contemporary problems of high seas fishing. The provisions note that the 1982 Convention's management of high seas fisheries, including the adoption, monitoring, and enforcement of effective conservation measures is inadequate. Thus, there are problems of unregulated fishing, overcapitalization, excessive fleet size, vessels reflagging to escape controls, insufficiently selective gear, unreliable data bases and lack of sufficient cooperation between States.
As part of the Agenda 21 blueprint for change, each subject heading provides a proposed framework on how to effect improvement. Thus, the Agreement provides Objectives, suggested Activities, and a program for Means of Implementation. Of particular relevance to regional fishery bodies, Program Area C makes numerous references to subjects requiring cooperation at subregional, regional and global levels. These subjects include, inter alia, the convening of an intergovernmental conference under United Nations auspices on straddling stocks and highly migratory stocks; promoting enhanced data-collection and exchange of data; assessing high seas resource potentials and developing profiles of all target and non-target stocks; encouraging cooperation with other subregional, regional or global fishery bodies, and where none exist, States should cooperate to establish one; enhance human resource development training in high seas fishing techniques, resource assessment, and as observers
and inspectors on fishing vessels; and upgrade systems for monitoring, control and surveillance of marine resources.
In 1994, an Administrative Committee on Coordination/Sub-Committee on Oceans and Coastal Areas (ACC/SC) was established to monitor and review the implementation of Chapter 17. With regard to fisheries, FAO and the United Nations were assigned joint responsibility for overseeing the implementation of Program Area C (marine living resources of the high seas), while only FAO is responsible for the implementation of Program Area D (marine living resources in national jurisdictions).
CODE OF CONDUCT FOR RESPONSIBLE FISHERIES
The Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries was principally the outcome of the International Conference on Responsible Fishing held in Cancun, Mexico, from 6 to 8 May, 1992.
The primary aim of the Conference was to attain consensus on the need for an International Code on Responsible Fishing. The consensus was reached and formalized in the Declaration of Cancun which sets out a list of subjects requiring attention to preserve the marine environment. Thus, Paragraph 10 of the Declaration of Cancún provides for responsible fishing within zones of national jurisdiction, and paragraph 11 provides that:
"States should cooperate on bilateral, regional and multilateral levels to establish, reinforce and implement effective means and mechanisms to ensure responsible fishing on the high seas, in accordance with relevant provisions of UNCLOS ..."
To address the matters raised in the Declaration of Cancún, it was intended that the Code would cover fishing activity both within and beyond zones of national jurisdiction, and embrace a wide range of subjects leading to better conservation and management of fisheries including, inter alia, the gross overcapacity of the global fishing fleet, the inadequate control of vessels by flag States, the inadequate provision of fishery data to both flag States and coastal States, and trade restrictions intended to achieve environmental protection,
In content, the Code is comprised of twelve articles and two annexes. Articles 1 - 5 cover the nature and scope of the Code; its objectives; its relationship with other international instruments; implementation, monitoring and updating procedures; and the special requirements of Developing Countries. The substantive provisions are in Articles 6 - 12. Article 6 describes the general principles of the Code, making reference to the subsequent more detailed Code provisions. Article 7 deals with Fisheries Management, Article 8 with Fishing Operations, Article 9 with Aquaculture Development, Article 10 with Integration of Fisheries Into Coastal Area Management, Article 11 with Post-Harvest Practices and Trade, and Article 12 with Fisheries Research.
These subjects allow the Code to cover a considerable number of controversial and problematic issues in contemporary fisheries conservation and management. For example, the Precautionary approach is adopted and specifically related to those fishing practices which are particularly damaging to the environment such as uncertainty relating to the size and productivity of stocks, and the impact of fishing activities (including discards) on non-target and associated or dependent species, as well as environmental and socio-economic conditions. On the issue of insufficiently selective fishing gear, and environmentally damaging fish practices, the Code provides management objectives which include measures providing that:
"pollution, waste, discards, catch by lost or abandoned gear, catch of non-target species, both fish and non-fish species, and impacts on associated or dependent species are minimized, through measures including, to the extent practicable, the development and use of selective, environmentally safe and cost-effective fishing gear and techniques."
Of particular relevance to this report, the Code makes numerous references to the role of RFBs in establishing a responsible international fisheries regime. Article 1.2 notes that the Code is global in scope, and directed towards fishing entities that include RFBs. From Article 4.1, such entities are charged with collaborating in the fulfilment and implementation of the Code. In Article 6.5 RFBs should apply a precautionary approach to the conservation, management and exploitation of living aquatic resources. The Article 7 provisions on Fisheries Management make numerous references to the role of RFBs in attaining Management objectives; providing a Management framework and procedures; data gathering and management advice; application of the Precautionary approach; describing management measures; and implementation of the Code.
Article 1.1 of the Code states that it is a voluntary instrument. Thus, it does not have to be formally accepted by Governments in the manner of the below mentioned UN Fish Stocks Agreement and the Compliance Agreement.
AGREEMENT TO PROMOTE COMPLIANCE WITH INTERNATIONAL CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT MEASURES BY FISHING VESSELS ON THE HIGH SEAS
A parallel legal initiative that took place at the same time as the Code of Conduct were the negotiations to construct an international agreement that would deal with the problem of reflagged fishing vessels on the high seas. Thus, the Declaration of Cancún specifically provides in paragraph 13 that States should take effective action, consistent with international law, to deter the practice of reflagging of vessels as a means of avoiding compliance with applicable conservation and management rules for fishing activities on the high seas.
The matter of reflagging of fishing vessels was further addressed by Agenda 21 of UNCED where paragraphs 17.51 - 17.53 deal with duties of a flag State, and 17.53 specifically provides that:
"States should take effective action, consistent with international law, to deter reflagging of vessels by their nationals as a means of avoiding compliance with applicable conservation and management rules for fishing activities on the high seas."
In September, 1992 the issue of reflagged fishing vessels was taken up by the FAO Technical Consultation on High Seas Fishing, and at the one hundred and second session of the FAO Council, the Council agreed:
"that the issue of reflagging of fishing vessels into flags of convenience to avoid compliance with agreed conservation and management measures, ...should be addressed immediately by FAO, with a view to finding a solution which could be implemented in the near future."
The Compliance Agreement was negotiated under Article XIV of the FAO Constitution, and adopted by the FAO Conference on 24 November 1993.
The Compliance Agreement requires that each State party shall take measures to ensure that fishing vessels entitled to fly its flag do not engage in any activity which undermines the effectiveness of international conservation and management measures. Further, no party should allow any of its vessels to be u
