C. Presentation of the B.R. Sen awards for 1996 and 1997
3. The awards, honouring the name of the late B.R. Sen, Director-General of FAO from 1956 to 1967, are conferred annually. Each year, the award is presented to the field officer who has made the most outstanding contribution to the country or countries to which he or she has been assigned.
4. The 1996 award was conferred to Mr. Hon Tat Tang, a national of Malaysia, in recognition of his major contribution to the work of the South Pacific Forestry Development Programme in Fiji. Under his leadership the South Pacific Forestry Development Programme had provided an effective and interactive forum that had elevated the forests and trees sector into regional prominence. Mr. Tang was unable to come to Rome to receive the award, and it was collected on his behalf by Mr. Sofara Aveau, Director of Agriculture, Forests, Fisheries and Meteorology, Samoa.
5. The award for 1997 was conferred on Mr. Les Clark, a national of New Zealand, in recognition of his outstanding contribution to fisheries policy and planning in Namibia. During the past five years as Special Adviser to the Minister for Fisheries and Marine Resources in Namibia, Mr. Clark had designed, documented and assisted in the implementation of a policy of fishing rights and quotas which had made a substantial contribution to the restructuring and strengthening of the Ministry of Fisheries.
D. Presentation of the A.H. Boerma award for 1996-97
6. The A.H. Boerma Award is presented biennially to a journalist or journalists whose work has helped to focus attention on important aspects of food problems, and has stimulated interest in, and support for, measures leading to their solution.
7. The award for 1996-97 was shared by the Association of Food and Agriculture Journalists (AFAJ) of Kenya, for its strong commitment to the coverage of food, agricultural and environmental issues with particular reference to the water hyacinth weed multi-media campaign; and to the Inter Press Service (IPS), a Third World news agency based in Rome, for its significant contribution over the past thirty years to covering sustainable agriculture and rural development issues in more than one hundred countries, thereby filling the information gap between developed and developing countries.
E. Presentation of the Edouard Saouma award for 1996-97
8. The Edouard Saouma Award is conferred biennially on a national or regional institution which has implemented with particular efficiency a project funded by the Technical Cooperation Programme (TCP).
9. The Award for 1996-97 was shared by two national institutions, one from the People's Republic of Bangladesh, and the other from the Islamic Republic of Iran, for their outstanding contributions to the implementation of TCP-funded projects. The Award was received by the representatives of these two institutions.
10. The Department of Fisheries of the Ministry of Fisheries and Livestock of Bangladesh, represented by Mr. Liaquat Ali, had developed a "Trickle-Down" Extension System, that was successful in disseminating an improved, appropriate, pond-fish culture technology throughout the country under a TCP project. The concerned FAO technical unit for the project was the Inland Water Resources and Aquaculture Service (FIRI) of the Fishery Resources Division.
11. The Technical Infrastructure Directorate of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Islamic Republic of Iran, represented by Mr. Darab Malekghasemi, had effectively contributed to improving the water management situation in the country under a TCP project. The concerned FAO technical unit for the project was the Water Resources Development and Management Service (AGLW) of the Land and Water Development Division.
12. Both projects succeeded exceptionally well due to the dedication, enthusiasm and drive of the national staff, and the commitment by their technical counterparts in FAO both in the field and at Headquarters. In their acceptance speeches, the representatives of the two national institutions briefed the Conference on the achievements and catalytic effects generated by the TCP-funded projects and thanked the Organization for the valuable assistance it had provided.
F. In memoriam
13. The Conference observed one minute of silence in memory of those staff members who had died in the service of the Organization since the Conference had last met. The names of the deceased staff members were read aloud and are contained in the Verbatim Records of the Conference.

III. Resolution 1/97
A. The conservation and sustainable use of genetic resources for food and agriculture
B. Major trends and policies in Food and Agriculture
A. The conservation and sustainable use of genetic resources for food and agriculture
THE CONFERENCE,
Considering the importance given in Agenda 21 to promoting the conservation and utilization of biotic and abiotic resources for sustainable agricultural development of the world and the role of genetic resources for the promotion of sustainable agriculture and rural development,
Noting the call of the FAO Council, of the 7th Session of the Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture, and of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) for an effective and speedy completion of the revision of the International Undertaking on Plant Genetic Resources,
Welcoming the outcome of the 4th International Technical Conference on Plant Genetic Resources, in particular the Leipzig Global Plan of Action as adopted,
Recalling the World Food Summit Plan of Action committed governments with the support of international institutions to promote the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity:
1. Emphasizes that the conservation and sustainable use of genetic resources for food and agriculture is a key objective in FAO policies and relevant programme areas and is a priority issue in the 1998-99 Programme of Work and Budget;
2. Encourages FAO to collaborate closely with the Executive Secretary of the CBD;
3. Calls upon Member Nations to continue negotiations for the revision of the International Undertaking on Plant Genetic Resources in a constructive spirit of compromise in order to be able to report considerable results to the Fourth Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity and to finalize these negotiations, as early as possible;
4. Invites members to contribute extra-budgetary resources to support the convening of extraordinary meetings, if needed, necessary to finalize the negotiations;
5. Encourages FAO to facilitate and promote the implementation of the Leipzig Global Plan of Action, as adopted, by all stakeholders;

(Adopted on 17 November 1997)
B. Major trends and policies in Food and Agriculture
The World food summit and its follow-up
49. The Conference endorsed the report prepared by the Committee on World Food Security (CFS) and submitted to it through the Council, in accordance with Resolution 2/95, on all aspects of the World Food Summit and its follow-up. It expressed appreciation for the contribution of all concerned to making the Summit a success and, stressing the importance of maintaining the momentum generated in order to permit achievement of the Summit's goals, welcomed the information provided on action already undertaken to ensure follow-up at the country, regional and international levels.
50. The Conference underlined the primary responsibility of national governments for implementing the WFS Plan of Action, and supported arrangements already made by the CFS for monitoring implementation, drawing mainly on national reports. Noting that the June 1998 session of the CFS would be crucial to establish a benchmark against which future progress would be measured, the Conference urged all countries to submit their reports on the first year of implementation of the Plan of Action by 31 January 1998, and subsequent reports in an equally timely fashion, to enable the CFS to fulfill the crucial role assigned to it by the Summit.
51. The Conference recalled that reporting on follow-up to the International Conference on Nutrition (ICN) would already occur as part of the monitoring of implementation of the WFS Plan of Action. Considering the scope of the Plan of Action and its coverage of the goals and issues covered by the Programme of Action of the World Conference on Agrarian Reform and Rural Development (WCARRD), the Conference considered that progress reporting could be covered in the CFS process, and therefore decided to discontinue separate progress reporting on WCARRD. It recommended that ECOSOC, which would be receiving reports on WFS follow up, adopt the same approach.
52. The Conference underlined the importance of coordination and cooperation within the UN System in the follow-up to the World Food Summit. In view of the multi-disciplinary nature of food security, the Conference encouraged other organizations, in particular those of the United Nations system, to participate actively in supporting follow-up efforts, and to provide information on their activities to the CFS. Bearing in mind the calendar of meetings in the forthcoming biennium, the Conference requested the CFS to provide, through the Council, a first report on implementation of the WFS Plan of Action to ECOSOC in 1999. It further decided to examine progress in follow-up to the World Food Summit at its Thirtieth Session in the same year.
53. During the debate many Member Nations reported on actions taken or underway at national level to implement the Summit commitments, including the preparation of national reports and action plans. Several countries also indicated that in preparing their plans or their reports to the CFS, they were making active efforts to involve all stakeholders, including civil society organizations. In this connection, it was recalled that the CFS would be considering ways of facilitating broader participation by non-governmental observers in its work. It was also noted that at the 1998 session of the CFS, the original reports to the CFS from all countries and organizations would be made available for reference. The Secretariat would provide a synthesis of these reports to facilitate the work of the Committee. With regard to the regional and subregional dimensions of the Plan of Action, the Conference noted that one full day would be devoted, by each FAO Regional Conference in 1998, to
the question of Summit follow-up, and that the results of these debates would be reported in due course to the CFS and to the Council. Mention was also made of the need to give special attention to the particular problems of Small Island Developing States (SIDS), if possible by convening a special conference at an early date.
54. The Conference welcomed the establishment of the ACC Network on Rural Development and Food Security, operated jointly by FAO and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) in close cooperation with the World Food Programme (WFP), as an important means of ensuring a multi-disciplinary input by the UN system to support national efforts to implement the Plan of Action. It was noted that the network was conceived as a two tiered mechanism, with a focus on action at the country level undertaken by inter-agency thematic groups on rural development and food security operating within the UN Resident Coordinator system. At the headquarters level, the network was to provide support for country level action and obtain feedback on experience which could be shared, as well as to facilitate dialogue between participating organizations largely through electronic means. It would also serve as a channel to mobilize reporting on follow-up to the WFS by UN System
organizations, as required by the CFS, to monitor progress on the Plan of Action.
55. The Conference noted with appreciation the initiative taken by FAO to play a catalytic role in elaboration and definition of a Food Insecurity and Vulnerability Information and Mapping System (FIVIMS) in collaboration with concerned UN System organizations, competent national institutions and non-governmental organizations, and supported plans for its further development. It considered that accurate and timely data was fundamental to national and international response to the problem of hunger and malnutrition, and stressed the need for full participation by developing countries in the establishment of national FIVIMS to be linked within the decentralized international system. The Conference was informed that arrangements envisaged reliance to the maximum extent possible on existing data bases and mechanisms. The suggestion was made that the range of partners could be broadened to include other large-scale data bases covering themes related to food security.
56. The Conference welcomed the conclusion of the Memorandum of Understanding of May 1997 between FAO and the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and expressed its support for the actions being taken. It welcomed, in particular the holding by the Committee on Economic Social and Cultural Rights of a general discussion on 1 December 1997 on the normative content of the right to food, to be followed by an expert seminar to better define and propose ways to implement the right to food, organized by the High Commissioner with support from relevant UN agencies including FAO. In this connection, one country raised a question as to the appropriateness of FAO providing technical assistance to the Committee or the High Commissioner on this matter. Some countries stressed the importance of national legislation on the right to food, with the assistance of FAO where necessary.
57. The Conference adopted the following Resolution:
<section>4</section>

Recognizing the important contribution by FAO to the follow-up of Objective 7.4 of the World Food Summit Plan of Action in co-operating with the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the Commission on Human Rights:
1. Welcomes the work already undertaken by the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights regarding the right to food and the cooperation in this respect with FAO;
2. Urges the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights to give priority to her ongoing work on a better definition of the rights related to food in Article 11 of the Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and to propose ways to implement and realize these rights as a means of achieving the commitments and objectives of the World Food Summit, taking into account the possibility of formulating voluntary guidelines for food security for all;
3. Invites the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights to inform the Committee on World Food Security, at its next session on the progress of her work in this regard;

(Adopted on 17 November 1997)
58. In referring to initiatives launched by FAO to assist countries in pursuing Summit objectives, several Members made particular reference to the FAO initiative to prepare draft documents on national strategies for agriculture and food security towards the year 2010. A number of Members supported the Special Programme for Food Security (SPFS). Some Members mentioned the positive roles of the SPFS, such as the replicability of the modules, and its role as a catalyst for mobilizing investment resources and triggering policy reforms. A number of Members welcomed the South-South Cooperation Scheme, including one country where the Scheme was operational and had been successful in transferring technology, contributing to a doubling of grain yields.
59. The Conference welcomed the information provided on the first TeleFood (TeleFood 1997) which had taken place on 19 October 1997, in connection with World Food Day, with the main aim of raising awareness and mobilizing support around the globe for the fight against hunger and malnutrition. It noted that in accordance with the provisions of Financial Regulation 6.7 and the General Rules of the Organization, the Director-General would be reporting to the Finance Committee on the collection and utilization of the TeleFood proceeds. One Member Nation, concerned about possible competition with NGO activities, stated that it could not consider itself bound to promote TeleFood nationally.
