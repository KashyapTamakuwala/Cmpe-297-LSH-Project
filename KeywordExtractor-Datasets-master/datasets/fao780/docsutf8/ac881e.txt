Programme de Développement Integré des Pêches Artisanales en Afrique de l'Ouest - DIPA Programme for Integrated Development of Artisanal Fisheries in West Africa - IDAF.
With financial assistance from Denmark and in collaboration with the Republic of Benin, the Fisheries Department of FAO is implementing in West Africa a programme of small scale fisheries development, commonly called the IDAF Project. This programme is based upon an integrated approach involving production, processing and marketing of fish, and related activities, it also involves an active participation of the target fishing communities. This report is a working paper and the conclusions and recommendations are those appropriate at the time of preparation. The working papers have not necessarily been cleared for publication by the government(s) concerned nor by FAO. They may be modified in the light of future knowledge gained at subsequent stages of the Project and issued later in other series. The designations employed and the presentation of material do not imply the expression of any opinion on the part of FAO or a financing agency concerning the legal status of any country or territory, city or area, or concerning the determination of its frontiers or boundaries.

REGIONAL SEMINAR ON ARTISANAL FISHERMEN'S MIGRATIONS IN WEST AFRICA.
Cotonou - 3rd to 5th December 1991 Report A regional seminar on artisanal fishermen's migrations in West Africa (from Mauritania to the Congo) took place in Cotonou from the 3rd to the 5th of December 1991, in Cotonou, on the initiative of the FAO/IDAF.
OBJECTIVES.
This seminar brought together fisheries officials from ten countries in the region and was organized as a follow-up to the Round Table of experts held in Kokrobite from the 6th to the 9th of November 1990. Its main objectives were :.
to convey the considerable amount of information brought to light at the Kokrobite meeting to fishery officials in the region.
to gather information as to national policies and official points of view concerning fisheries migrations in the region.
to encourage an exchange of opinions on these different questions and to formulate recommendations to serve as reference in the setting-up of national and regional policies on the specific theme of artisanal fisheries migrations.
PARTICIPATION.
Of the 14 countries invited 4 (Togo, Sierra Leone, Gabon, Guinea) were unable to attend the seminar for diverse reasons. The absence of Togo (like that of Liberia which could not even be invited) is explained by the exceptional political context prevailing at present in this country. Sierra Leone, Guinea and Gabon were unable to attend because of reasons pertaining to the invitation itself or for logistic problems. Considering the importance of migration in these countries, particular care will be given to inform them of the results (see appendix 1 for the list of participants).
2 It is also regrettable that the ECOWAS, with whom informal contact had been made as of last July, did not reply to the invitation and other official correspondence sent about it. The seminar did, however, benefit by the participation of Mrs. King, FAO consultant on mission for this organization. The seminar organizers expressed the hope that this participation would facilitate future involvement of this regional organization in the follow-up of the seminar's recommendations.
THE MEETING.
The seminar followed the established programme, with participants showing great engagement. It was chaired by Mr. George Everett, FIP/FAO, following an introductory note delivered by Mr. Mensah, Benin's Director of Fisheries (see appendix 2).
3.1.Review and discussion of the situation in the countries represented.
A review of the artisanal fishery context and the situation of migrant fishermen in the different countries represented was undertaken through a summary of the document "Migrant fishermen in West Africa : Problems and Prospects" (to appear in the IDAF Working Papers series). This full document had been handed out upon the arrival of participants. The country summaries were presented in English and French, respectively, by Jan M. Haakonsen and Chimère M. Diaw. They were followed by amendments and discussions in which special attention was given to the comments of the representative of the country concerned. Several participants had prepared written exposes to this effect. The discussions mostly concerned the statistics for the fishery sector (FAO, 1986) which the participants requested to be brought up to date using more recent data obtainable in the different countries. The presentation of the migratory patterns, their impact and future prospects for the migrant fishermen in each of the countries considered, also stimulated lively discussion which brought to light the concerns of fishery administrators as well as national policies on the topic. On the whole, a distinct willingness to work towards greater integration of migrant communities in the economic and social life of the host countries was expressed, as well as a desire to obtain more active collaboration between immigrant and emigrant countries (coastal and continental) in the management of this particular phenomenon. In the discussions it was also reminded that other aspects of the problem should not be neglected ; in particular, the question of internal migrations, continental migrations and that of auxiliary workers to the fishery sector (such as women) or other sectors connected with fisheries.
3 The revised version of the document "Problems and prospects" will take into account a significant part of the complementary information gathered during these discussions.
3.2 Presentation of the results of the questionnaire sent to fisheries departments in the region.
This questionnaire had been distributed to the 14 countries long before the seminar was to take place. It covered certain legislative or regulatory aspects concerning artisanal fishery and migrant fishermen. It also included a section dealing with the way in which the responsible services perceive the conditions and contributions of migrant fishermen to the economy of their respective countries. 13 countries replied and the results, as presented in the course of the seminar, are included in appendix 3.
3.3 Aspects of ECOWAS policies relevant to artisanal fisheries.
In the absence of an official representative from the ECOWAS, Mrs. Hannah King made a concise summary of the regional organization's engagement in the subject, especially on food security. It was emphasized that, although the ECOWAS has not really looked into the matter of fishermen's migrations, the connection between these and food security objectives are sufficiently evident to justify increased interest. In the general recommendations made during a reunion of regional fishery experts in Dakar in 1985, the ECOWAS also emphasized the importance of scientific research and the necessity to coordinate scientific studies on a regional level so as to facilitate the establishment and utilization of the data bases, as well as the carryingout of different quantitative measures, of validation or follow-up of research.
Group work.
Three working groups were assembled as a result of the general discussions in order to formulate recommendations on the subject. Their first task was to look into a fictitious case (appendix 4) in which different problems and different levels of comprehension concerning them were presented. The purpose of this simulation was to encourage active collaboration within the groups, through problems to which everybody would be neutral. Although conceived so as to avoid any resemblance with real situations in the region, the simulation nonetheless handled plausible problems, for which all participants actively took part in trying to find a solution. Following the three cases studied during this exercise, the participants elaborated a certain number of recommendations which they were able to use later on when considering the real situation in the region.
4 This simulation work was thus followed by a second meeting of working groups to discuss the problems in the region and elaborate the recommendations of the seminar. This work, the results of which are presented below, was also carried out in excellent spirit. All the working group meetings were followed by discussions in full session.
RECOMMENDATIONS.
As a result of the seminar held from the 3rd to the 5th of December 1991 in Cotonou, on the theme of artisanal fishermen's migration, the participants recommend : I. Information and follow-up of the question.
Wide diffusion of the information and recommendations resulting from the seminar in Cotonou and that of Kokrobite (6th - 9th November 1990) to : · · the Governments of the countries in the region, with copies to the Ministries supervising fisheries, Fishery Departments and marine research institutes. Regional and Sub-regional Organizations : o ECOWAS ; UDEAC ; CEAO. o Ministerial Conference on Fisheries Cooperation Between States Bordering the Atlantic Ocean (from Morocco to Angola). o Sub-regional Fisheries Commission (Mauritania, Cap-Verde, Senegal, The Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, Guinea). o Regional Fisheries Committee of the Gulf of Guinea - COREP (Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Sao-Tomé and Principe, Gabon, Zaïre). o Lake Chad Basin Commission - CBLT (Cameroon, Niger, Nigeria, Chad). o CECAF.
5 · Continental and International Organizations o OAU ; ADB ; o FAO ; ILO ; World Bank. It is also recommended :.
That the question of migrant fishermen be followed closely by all the organizations and institutions concerned and that active research be carried out so as to define the means of management more adapted to the diverse situations found in the region.
To set up means to follow the movements of people and property associated with artisanal fisheries in those countries where such means are non-existent and to periodically evaluate the socio-economic importance of such movements.
To facilitate, in accordance with those measures that can be taken on a regional level, the comparability of information relating to these movements as well as the exchange of information between national institutions.
To encourage collaboration between fisheries administrations, representatives of the fishing communities and consular representatives of the countries concerned, so as to improve the monitoring of fishermen's migrations. II. REGIONAL AND SUB-REGIONAL COORDINATION AND COOPERATION Recognizing that artisanal fishermen's migrations are but a reflection of the characteristics of the fishery sector as well as the great interdependency of the different fisheries and their economies in the region, the seminar recommends :.
To work towards the harmonizing of legislation and regulations through mutual consultations between the different countries in the region or a given sub-region.
To encourage and coordinate national and regional research efforts on fisheries management and migrations and to stimulate cooperation between research institutes and national fishery departments in the region.
To encourage the signing of bilateral and/or multilateral agreements facilitating the movements of artisanal fishermen as well as the interregional flow brought about as a result, especially in regards to commerce and food supply.
To work together and in close collaboration with the ECOWAS, UDEAC, the Ministerial Conference and all other competent institutions, towards the gradual establishment of a regional framework responsible for the management of artisanal fishermen's migrations and other associated migrations. 10. To bear in mind the isolation of certain communities, as well as the problems of convertibility of different currencies. III. NATIONAL MANAGEMENT OF FISHERIES Recognizing the positive impact of migrant fishermen on national fisheries economies, especially with respect to the production and supply of animal protein, the creation of employment and technological progress, but also recognizing the occasional occurrence of friction and even conflicts caused mainly by misunderstandings or management problems in the sector, the participants recommend : 11. To make migrant fishermen aware, in their country of origin as well as in the host country, of the laws, regulations and agreements applicable to artisanal fisheries and fishermen's migrations in the countries or zones of destination, and to ensure that existing national arrangements be applied. 12. To protect migrant fishermen, a particularly vulnerable category of people, against administrative misuse of authority, and to this end carry out active policies aimed at sensitizing relevant national services. 13. To advise host country governments to help facilitate the reception and sojourn procedures concerning migrant fishermen and allow them access to the same subsidiary services as the local population. 14. To take into account migrations auxiliary to fishing in the above-mentioned measures as well as in the management of fisheries in general. 15. To prioritize the prevention of conflicts and to try to solve them at a local level, with the help of local administrations.
7 16. To encourage integration of the economic activities of the migrants and local populations within the fishing sector (crew formation, transfer of techniques), within artisanal processing as well as the commercialization of marine products. Within this context and bearing in mind the vital and dynamic role played by women in West African fisheries, it is particularly recommended, when relevant : 17. To encourage cooperation between the migrant and local women in the processing and commercialization of the fish rather than exclude one or the other of these two categories. The seminar finally recommends : 18. That host countries allow migrant fishermen to carry out their customs and traditions, within the limits of the laws in force in these countries. 19. To acknowledge the positive role of traditional and community institutions set up by the migrant fishermen, or local communities, and therefore to try to include them into fisheries management, inter-communal relations and solution of conflicts. 20. To work towards creating relationships of confidence between the administrators and fishermen, including migrant fishermen, by making the administrations more accessible to the fishermen. 21. To encourage the diffusion of existing information on artisanal fisheries and the role of migrant fishermen, for the purpose of improved fisheries management and educating communities and administrative agents.

OPENING SPEECH.
delivered by Mr. Gilbert Mensah Director of Fisheries, Benin LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, DEAR GUESTS: We are particularly honoured to host this first seminar for West African fisheries officials on the important question of migrant fisherman. This meeting is also important in that it constitutes a precise - and certainly precious - attempt to transmit a certain number of research findings to those who are responsible for the application of development policies in the area. This meeting has therefore the intent of providing a valuable setting for exchange and synergy based on the acknow-ledged fact that our fisheries are interdependent, not only on an environmental and biological level, but also from the point of view of social and economic exchanges. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, The round table of experts on West African fisheries migrations which took place in Kokrobite (Ghana) a year ago, has considerably increased our knowledge of these kinds of movements, though there still remain a certain number of points requiring closer examination. One could perhaps start by intimating that the secret behind the vitality of African canoe fisheries may well lie in its flexibility and continuance as well as in the historical role played by migrations, which go back to the 5th century at least, in their evolution and consolidation. Even today, on the strength of this formidable heritage, West African marine fishermen daily brave the sea, fate and frontiers. As we will most certainly see in the course of this seminar, the studies presently available on fishermen's migrations cover a significant number of themes, in particular their extent in both quantitative and qualitative terms, their range, patterns, impact and variations ; both on national, sub-regional and regional levels. The participants at the Kokrobite meeting came to the conclusion that the migrant fishermen have, on the whole, a mainly positive impact on the evolution of the fisheries.
11 They tend to create new possibilities of employment and income both in the host countries and in their countries of origin, and are active agents in the diffusion of technology and new fishing methods. In certain cases, their presence can serve as a pretext for friction or conflicts. However, it should no doubt be possible to minimize these conflicts, by identifying the true causes and by establishing appropriate rules and measures to deal with it. That is why the Round Table in Kokrobite judged it absolutely necessary to seriously inform the governments of the region on the importance of fishermen's migrations. Such information is essential to increase our ability to manage national fisheries. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, The objective of this seminar that I have the honour to inaugurate today, is thus linked to a desire to improve the position of fishery administrators and decision-makers faced with the question of fisheries migrations in West Africa. In spite of the availability of the interesting scientific reports and documents published on the subject, it would seem that direct dialogue between national fisheries officers is an irreplaceable element in the setting-up of liable standards of management. That is the actual purpose of our presence here today and the main aim of this seminar. The second aim of this meeting is to obtain the points of view of the governments and acquire better understanding of the considerations behind them. Closely connected to this is the third aim of the seminar which is to identify the governmental policies applied to migrant fishermen and artisanal fishermen in general, and evaluate the context of their application. The underlying goal of the seminar as a whole is, of course, to be able to formulate suggestions and conclusions as expressed by official government representatives. Combined with the information presented at Kokrobite, these could then serve as a basis for IDAF and FAO to formulate a common reference framework for governmental policies in the region. Wishing you all a fruitful session, I reiterate my welcome and hope you will have a pleasant stay in Benin.

SYNTHETIC TABLE OF OFFICIAL POLICIES PERTAINING TO ARTISANAL FISHERIES AND MIGRANT FISHERMEN.
(based on the replies given by 13 countries to a questionnaire distributed to fishery departments in the West African region) I. FISHING ZONES RESERVED FOR ARTISANAL FISHERY (map N° 1) All the countries in the region (apart from Liberia for which the information was not available) have established a fishing zone reserved for artisanal fishery. However, considerable variations may be observed in the different countries ; the Côte d'Ivoire has the most narrow limit (1 nautical mile although an extension to 2 miles is probable) and Guinea-Bissau the widest (12 nautical miles). In between these extremes, one may distinguish two groups: a group with a relatively narrow reserved zone ranging from 2 (Cameroon and Nigeria) and 3 n. miles (Mauritania, Benin and Gabon) to 4 n. miles (Togo). a second group with relatively wide reserved zones ranging from 5 (Sierra Leone) and 6 n. miles (Senegal, Guinea) to 8 n. miles (Congo). In the case of Ghana, this distance from the coast could not be measured as the artisanal fishing zone is determined according to bathometric depth (30 meters). In addition, some countries tolerate the used of the reserved zone by certain types of vessels. This is the case in Senegal where sardine-boats are allowed to fish within 3 miles of the coast and in Ghana, where the limitation is not applied to pelagic vessels. In addition, Guinea reserves the zone between 6 and 15 nautical miles for "advanced" artisanal fisheries. Other countries, on the other hand, have restrictions to certain types of artisanal fishing, some of which are totally prohibited. This is the case of beach seines in The Gambia and drift nets in Benin.
13 All the countries impose sanctions on industrial vessels (and semi-industrial ones in some cases) that violate the reserved zones. These sanctions take the same form everywhere, that is to say fines (the amount of which varies according to the country), coupled with confiscation of the catch and/or temporary seizure of the vessel. There are only two countries (Senegal and Mauritania) where these measures are theoretically coupled with prison sentences, while Benin and Gabon give the offender the choice between prison and payment of the fine. II. TAXES, RIGHTS AND FEES.
Fees and fishing rights The first significant fact is that no country admits to any official distinction between national fishermen and foreigners. When categorial distinctions appear, notably in the payment of fees or fishing rights, these are made according to technological differences so as to the type of fishery (Guinea-Bissau excepted). This is the case in the Congo where the big motorized canoes (of the Popoh type) pay 25.000 F CFA, double the annual fee paid by the smaller motorized boats (Vili type). The same differentiation is to be found in the Cameroon, where there are 4 categories of fishing licence. The large artisanal boats are classed as category A ; that is "semi-industrial fishing" and pay an annual fee of 50.000 F CFA compared to "sport fishing" (25.000 F CFA), shrimping (5.000 F CFA) and "lucrative artisanal fishery" (3.000 F CFA). Guinea-Bissau, along with Togo, seems to be the only country making a real distinction between national and foreign fishermen in the payment of fishing licences. In the former, the scale is from 1 to 10 in disfavours of the foreign fishing units : 25.000 Guinean pesos (5 US $) compared to 250.000 PG (50 US $) for non-motorized canoes ; 100.000 PG (20 US $) to 1.045.000 PG (209 US $) for motorized canoes. In Togo, however, the scale is of 1 to 2, whereas the amount of the fees is minimal anyway (1.000 F CFA for nationals and 2.000 F CFA for foreigners). Generally though, disregarding the case in Togo, and The Gambia where fishermen are shortly to be exempted from the payment of fishing licences, one may observe the existence of two types of policies, greatly contrasted, with regards to rights and licences or taxation of artisanal fishery products. On the one hand, a group made up of Mauritania, Senegal, Ghana, Benin, and Nigeria, where artisanal fishery units are exempted from all taxes and fees. On the other, a group made up of Guinea-Bissau, Côte d'Ivoire, Cameroon, Gabon, Congo and Guinea, where the taxes and fees to be paid are considerable. We have already looked at GuineaBissau, Cameroon and Congo. As for the last 2 countries, one must also add a production tax of 2 F CFA/kilo (Cameroon) as well as 25 F CFA/kilo on tuna landed in the Congo. However, it is not clear whether this last tax concerns artisanal fisheries (small tuna).
14 In Côte d'Ivoire, fishing rights are collected in two ways ; the licence itself (15,000 F CFA/year) and a boat tax (36.000 F CFA) for a total of 51.000 F CFA per annum. In Gabon, the fishing rights are even higher, being 25.000 F CFA a quarter, or a total of 100.000 F CFA per annum. Lastly, Guinea (Conakry) applies a particularly heavy system of taxation whereby the merchant navy collects five different taxes : inspection for putting into service, exceptional technical inspection, navigation licence, driving licence and professional card (for a total of FG 37.000) and the fishery department two other fees - fishing licence and professional card, the latter at FG 500 per horse power of the engine. The total amount paid in taxes is therefore FG 49.500 to FG 57.000 or more, depending on the power and number of engines, FG 500 worth about 1 US $. (According to another source - see IDAF/WP/36, p.110 - both the merchant navy and the fisheries department in Guinea apply two additional fees each bringing the total taxes to somewhere between FG 118.000 and FG 159.000).
Customs duty exemptions on equipment and fuel Customs duties complete the picture of taxation policies as applied to artisanal fishery in the region. None of the countries make any distinction between national and foreign fishermen at this level. One does observe however, with slight variations, the same tendencies already apparent in the area of fishing rights. In fact, Mauritania, Senegal, the Gambia, Togo and Ghana all apply a policy of exemption to artisanal fishermen for all duty due on equipment and fuel (only partial exemption for fuel in Ghana) whereas the Congo, Gabon, Guinea and Guinea-Bissau do not practice any kind of exoneration whatsoever. Between the two tendencies, we may situate Cameroon where only the equipment in exempted from duty ; Côte d'Ivoire and Benin (partially) where only the fuel is exempt. Lastly, in Nigeria, the equipment is taxed, but the locally produced fuel is the cheapest in the region (0,60 Naira per litre, about 0.06 US $ or less than 20 F CFA).
Import and export taxes Senegal, probably taking advantage of its limited imports of fishery products, is the only country, together with Guinea, that does not collect import or export taxes. Côte d'Ivoire recently abolished VAT on exported products and even established a bonus on exports. Mauritania, the Gambia, Guinea-Bissau and Congo thus remain the only countries still taxing exports of fishery products. However, for reasons perhaps similar to Senegal, Mauritania does not collect customs duties on imports. All the other countries, except for Guinea, collect import tax on different categories of products at a rate of 5 to 30 - 35 % of their value.
15 III. CONDITIONS AND CONTRIBUTIONS OF MIGRANTS IN TERMS OF HOST COUNTRIES AND COUNTRIES OF ORIGIN The second part of the questionnaire inquired about the migrants' situation but also on the way they are perceived by official services. It was presented with two types of questions; those directed at countries receiving large immigrant communities and those directed at countries "exporting" migrant fishermen. Benin and Nigeria are the only countries concerned by both aspects in a significant way. The present summary is based on the assumption that the replies given are a general reflection of the true situation.
Countries of immigration : Mauritania, The Gambia, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Côte d'Ivoire, Togo, Benin, Nigeria, Cameroon, Gabon and Congo Certain facts appear to apply massively to all these countries with respect to the access migrants have to motors, equipment and credit. This access is considered by those answering the questionnaire to be the same for all, regardless of origin. Only Togo and Gabon admit to differentiate on the subject of credit, and Mauritania did not reply to this question. However, the latter is the only country where it is not considered that the migrants posses better equipment than nationals. As for transfer of technology from migrants to nationals, only Cameroon and Gabon consider that this does not occur, while Mauritania was unable to answer. Lastly, conflicts are considered as rare except in Côte d'Ivoire and Gabon where they are said to occur frequently.
Countries of emigration : Senegal, Ghana, Benin and Nigeria No distinct pattern appears except for those questions concerning consular registration (only Senegal affirms that it actually takes place) and the signing of bilateral agreements. The situation of Senegal and its neighbours (Guinea-Bissau, the Gambia and Mauritania) differs greatly from the pattern of migrations in the Gulf of Guinea as a whole, where no bilateral agreements have been singed between countries of immigration and emigration. As for the other subjects raised (importance of income repatriated to the country of origin, importance of migrants contribution to the host country, flight of subsidized equipment and qualified labour force), the situation is appraised differently depending on the countries and even constitutes in some cases (on the subject of subsidized equipment for example) problems of interpretation. On the whole however, it would appear that Ghana is the country where the impact of emigration is least felt (in terms of income as well as drain) in contrast to Benin and to a lesser degree, Senegal, followed by Nigeria.

PRESENTATION OF GROUP WORK.
Welcome to Equatoria ! You are members of a team of fisheries officials from the inter-regional Association of Coastal African States (ACAS) and have been sent by the organization to advise the government of Equatoria on how to resolve problems arising from the presence of substantial numbers of artisanal fishermen from Tropica in the country. Attached you will find some basic data on Equatoria, particularly those concerning the fisheries sector the last 30 years, including statistics on catches, number of canoes, etc. You will be travelling to Equatoria several times, each time to deal with a specific question or set of questions, so do not try to solve all of Equatoria's fisheries problems at one time. Please bear in mind that this exercise is a simulation. Equatoria is a fictitious country which is not modeled on any specific West African nation, though some of Equatoria's problems may be encountered here and there in real countries. Any possible similarities between Equatoria and actual African nations are however unintended and purely coincidental. Good luck with your assignment !.

BACKGROUND NOTES ON EQUATORIA.
General The Republic of Equatoria is a West Africa country which gained independence in 1960. At the time, it has the most part in the rich agricultural areas of the Central Province. It's coastal belt has traditionally been sparsely populated. The sandy plains of
