<title>Social communication in nutrition: A methodology for intervention. Sorghum and millets in human nutrition</title>
<section>1</section>
Preface
For millions of people in the semi-arid tropics of Asia and Africa sorghum and millets are the most important staple foods. These crops sustain the lives of the poorest rural people and will continue to do so in the foreseeable future. Sorghum and millets grow in harsh environments where other crops do not grow well. Improvements in production, availability, storage, utilization and consumption of these food crops will significantly contribute to the household food security and nutrition of the inhabitants of these areas.
Sorghum and millets in human nutrition is a new addition to the FAO Food and Nutrition Series. The publication is broad in scope and coverage, starting with the history and nature of sorghum and millets and dealing with production, utilization and consumption. It provides extensive information on the nutritional value, chemical composition, storage and processing of these foods. In addition, the anti-nutritional factors present in these foods and ways of reducing their health hazards are discussed. The authors have described formulations of various popular foods prepared from sorghum and millets and their nutritional composition and quality, and they have compiled many recipes for the preparation of foods from regions where sorghum and millets are important dietary staples. An extensive bibliography is included as well.
Readers of this book may also be interested in the standards for sorghum and pearl millet grains and flours prepared by the Codex Alimentarius Commission under the Joint FAD/WHO Food Standards Programme.
FAO appreciates the collaboration and assistance of the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) in the preparation of this book. The Organization acknowledges the contributions of Dr R. Jambunathan and Dr V. Subramanian, both of ICRISAT, to Chapters 1, 2, 3 and 5 as well as those of Dr Y.G. Deosthale, of the National Institute of India, to Chapters 1, 4 and 6 and the Annex.
Sorghum and millets in human nutrition is intended to provide up-to-date scientific and practical information to scientists, government officials, extension workers, university professors and others interested in these foods. It is hoped that this text will assist them in the development of training programmes for their staff and students.

Chapter 1 - Introduction
Sorghum and millets have been important staples in the semi-arid tropics of Asia and Africa for centuries. These crops are still the principal sources of energy, protein, vitamins and minerals for millions of the poorest people in these regions.
Sorghum and millets are grown in harsh environments where other crops grow or yield poorly. They are grown with limited water resources and usually without application of any fertilizers or other inputs by a multitude of small-holder farmers in many countries. Therefore, and because they are mostly consumed by disadvantaged groups, they are often referred to as "coarse grain" or "poor people's crops". They are not usually traded in the international markets or even in local markets in many countries. The farmers seldom, therefore, have an assured market in the event of surplus production.
The cereals considered in this publication include sorghum, pearl millet, finger millet, foxtail millet, common millet, little millet, barnyard millet and kodo millet (Table 1). Teff (Eragrostis tef), which is extensively cultivated in Ethiopia, is not strictly a millet and is therefore not included. Other millets such as fonio (Digitaria exilis) and Job's tears (Coix lancryma-jobi) are of minor importance and are not described here.
Sorghum
Sorghum, Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench, is known under a variety of names: great millet and guinea corn in West Africa, kafir corn in South Africa, dura in Sudan, mtama in eastern Africa, jowar in India and kaoliang in China (Purseglove, 1972). In the United States it is usually referred to as milo or milo-maize (Table 1). Sorghum belongs to the tribe Andropogonae of the grass family Poaceae. Sugar cane, Saceharum officinarum, is a member of this tribe and a close relative of sorghum. The genus Sorghum is characterized by spikelets borne in pairs. Sorghum is treated as an annual, although it is a perennial grass and in the tropics it can be harvested many times.

In 1753 Linnaeus described in his Species platarum three species of cultivated sorghum: Holcus sorghum, Holcus saccaratus and Holcus tricolor. In 1794 Moench distinguished the genus Sorghum from the genus Holrcus, and in 1805 Person suggested the name Sorghum vulgare for Holcus sorghum (L.). In 1961 Clayton proposed the name Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench as the correct name for cultivated sorghum and this is currently being used.
The classification of sorghum by Snowden ( 1936) is detailed and complete. Other classifications proposed since that time have been modifications or adaptations of the Snowden system. Harlan and de Wet (1972) published a simplified classification of sorghum which has been checked against 10 000 head samples. They divided cultivated sorghum into five basic groups or races: bicolor, guinea, caudatum, kafir and durra. The wild type and shatter cane are considered two other spikelet types of S. tricolor. A study of polymorphism of 11 enzymes permitted classification of sorghum into three enzymatic groups. The first includes mainly guinea varieties of West Africa; the second southern African varieties of all five races; and the third durra and caudatum types of Central and East Africa (Ollitrault, Escoute and Noyer, 1989).
The cultivated sorghum of the present arose from a wild progenitor belonging to the subspecies verticilliflorum. The greatest variation in the genus Sorghum is observed in the region of the northeast quadrant of Africa comprising Ethiopia, the Sudan and East Africa (Doggett, 1988 ). It appears that sorghum moved into eastern Africa from Ethiopia around 200 AD or earlier. It was adopted and carried to the savannah countries of eastern and southern Africa by the Bantu people, who used the grain mainly to make beer. The Bantu people probably began their expansion from the region of southern Cameroon about the first century AD, moved along the southern border of the Congo forest belt and reached eastern Africa possibly before 500 AD. The present-day sorghums of central and southern Africa are closely related to those of the United Republic of Tanzania and more distantly related to those of West Africa, as the equatorial forests were an effective barrier to this spread.
Sorghum was probably taken to India from eastern Africa during the first millennium BC. It is reported to have existed there around 1000 BC. Sorghum was probably taken in ships as food in the first instance; chow traffic has operated for some 3 000 years between East Africa (the Azanean Coast) and India via the Sebaean Lane in southern Arabia. The sorghums of India are related to those of northeastern Africa and the coast between Cape Guardafui and Mozambique.
The spread along the coast of Southeast Asia and around China may have taken place about the beginning of the Christian era, but it is also possible that sorghum arrived much earlier in China via the silk trade routes.
Grain sorghum appears to have arrived in America as "guinea corn" from West Africa with the slave traders about the middle of the nineteenth century. Although sorghum arrived in Latin America through the slave trade and by navigators plying the Europe-Africa-Latin America trade route in the sixteenth century, the crop did not become important until the present century. The case is similar for Australia.
Grain sorghum grown primarily for food uses can be divided into milo, kafir, hegari, feterita and hybrids (Purseglove, 1972). There are other classes of sorghums such as sorghos, grass sorghums, broom-corn sorghum and specialpurpose sorghum.
The sorghum kernel varies in colour from white through shades of red and brown to pale yellow to deep purple-brown. The most common colours are white, bronze and brown. Kernels are generally spherical but vary in size and shape. The caryopsis can be rounded and bluntly pointed, 4 to 8 mm in diameter (Purseglove, 1972). The I 000-kernel weight has a very wide range of values, from 3 to 80 g, but in the majority of varieties it is between 25 and 30 g. The grain is partially covered with glumes. Large grains with corneous endosperm are usually preferred for human consumption. Yellow endosperm with carotene and xanthophyll increases the nutritive value. Sorghum grain that has a testa contains tannin in varying proportions depending on the variety.
Pearl millet
Pearl millet, Pennisetum glaucum, is also known as spiked millet, bajra (in India) and bulrush millet (Purseglove, 1972). Pearl millet may be considered as a single species but it includes a number of cultivated races. It almost certainly originated in tropical western Africa, where the greatest number of both wild and cultivated forms occurs. About 2 000 years ago the crop was carried to eastern and central Africa and to India, where because of its excellent tolerance to drought it became established in the drier environments.
The height of the pearl millet plant may range from 0.5 to 4 m and the grain can be nearly white, pale yellow, brown, grey, slate blue or purple. The ovoid grains are about 3 to 4 mm long, much larger than those of other millets, and the 1 000-seed weight ranges from 2.5 to 14 g with a mean of 8 g. The size of the pearl millet kernel is about one-third that of sorghum. The relative proportion of germ to endosperm is higher than in sorghum.
Minor millets
Minor millets (also referred to as small millets) (Seetharam, Riley and Harinarayana, 1989) have received far less attention than sorghum in terms of cultivation and utilization. They include finger millet (Eleusine coracana), foxtail millet (Setaria italica), kodo millet (Paspalum scrobiculatum), common or prove millet (Panicum miliaceum), little millet (Panicum sumatrense) and barnyard or sawa millet (Echinochloa crus-galli and Echinochloa corona) (Table 1). More information is available on finger millet than on any of the others. Minor millets account for less than one percent of the foodgrains produced in the world today. Thus they are not important in terms of world food production, but they are essential as food crops in their respective agro-ecosystems. They are mostly grown in marginal areas or under agricultural conditions where major cereals fail to give sustainable yields. Detailed descriptions of these millets are given by Purseglove ( 1972).
Finger millet
Finger millet, Eleusine coracana L., is also known as African millet, koracan, ragi (India), wimbi (Swahili), bulo (Uganda) and telebun (the Sudan). It is an important staple food in parts of eastern and central Africa and India. It is the principal cereal grain in northern and parts of western Uganda and northeastern Zambia. The grains are malted for making beer. Finger millet can be stored for long periods without insect damage (Purseglove, 1972) and thus it can be important during famine. Numerous cultivars have been identified. In India and Africa, two groups are recognized: African highland types with grains enclosed within the florets; and Afro-Asiatic types with mature grains exposed outside the florets. It is believed that Uganda or a neighbouring region is the centre of origin of E. coracana, and it was introduced to India at a very early date, probably over 3 000 years ago. Though finger millet is reported to have reached Europe at about the commencement of the
Christian era, its utilization is restricted mostly to eastern Africa and India.
The height of cultivars varies from 40 cm to I m and the spike length ranges from 3 to 13 cm. The colour of grains may vary from white through orange-red deep brown and purple, to almost black. The grains are smaller than those of pearl millet, and the mean I 000-seed weight is about 2.6 g.
Foxtail millet
Foxtail millet, Setaria italica L., is also known as Italian, German Hungarian or Siberian millet. It is generally considered to have been domesticated in eastern Asia, where it has been cultivated since ancient times. The main production area is China, but S. italic a is the most important millet in Japan and is widely cultivated in India (Purseglove, 1972). It is believed to have been one of the five sacred plants of ancient China (from 2700 BC). Because of its short duration it is a suitable crop for growing by nomads, and it was probably brought to Europe in this way during the Stone Age, as seeds abound in the Lake Dwellings in Europe.
The height of the plants varies from 1 to 1.5 m and the colour of the grain varies from pale yellow, through orange, red and brown to black. The 1 000-seed weight is about 2 g.
Common millet
Common millet, Panicum miliaceum L., is also known as prove millet, hog millet, broom-corn millet, Russian millet and brown corn. This millet is of ancient cultivation. It is the milium of the Romans and the true millet of history. It was cultivated by the early Lake Dwellers in Europe. It is believed to have been domesticated in central and eastern Asia and because of its ability to mature quickly was often grown by nomads.
The shallow-rooted plant varies in height between 30 and 100 cm. The grain contains a comparatively high percentage of indigestible fibre because the seeds are enclosed in the hulls and are difficult to remove by conventional milling processes. The 1 000-seed weight is about 5 g (varying between 4.7 and 7.2 g). Common millet is particularly suited to dry continental conditions and grows in more temperate climates than other millets.
Little millet
Little millet, Panicum sumatrense Roth ex Roemer & Schultes, is grown throughout India to a limited extent up to altitudes of 2 100 m but is of little importance elsewhere. It has received comparatively little attention from plant breeders. The plant varies in height between 30 and 90 cm and its oblong panicle varies in length between 14 and 40 cm. The seeds of little millet are smaller than those of common millet.
Barnyard millet
Barnyard, Japanese barnyard or sawa millet [Echinochloa crus-galli (L.) P.B. and Echinochloa colona (L.) Link] is the fastest growing of all millets and produces a crop in six weeks. It is grown in India, Japan and China as a substitute for rice when the paddy fails. It is grown as a forage crop in the United States and can produce as many as eight harvests per year. The plant has attracted some attention as a fodder in the United States and Japan. The height of the plant varies between 50 and 100 cm.
Kodo millet
Kodo millet, Paspalum scrobiculatum L., is a minor grain crop in India but is of great importance in the Deccan Plateau. Its cultivation in India is generally confined to Gujarat, Karnataka and parts of Tamil Nadu. It is classified into the groups Haria, Choudharia, Kodra and Haria-Choudharia depending on panicle characters. Kodo is an annual tufted grass that grows to 90 cm high. Some forms have been reported to be poisonous to humans and animals, possibly because of a fungus infecting the grain. The grain is enclosed in hard, corneous, persistent husks that are difficult to remove. The grain may vary in colour from light red to dark grey.

Grains and their structure
Kernels of sorghum and millets show considerable diversity in colour, shape, size and certain anatomical components (Table 2).
The basic kernel structure is similar in sorghum and different millets. The principal anatomical components are pericarp, germ or embryo and endosperm. In finger, prove and foxtail millets the pericarp is like a sack, loosely attached to the endosperm at only one point. In these utricle-type kernels the pericarp easily breaks away, leaving the seed-coat or testa to protect the inner endosperm. The kernels of sorghum and pearl millet are of the caryopsis type, in which the pericarp is completely fused to the endosperm.
The relative distribution of the three main kernel components varies. In the sorghum kernel the distribution by weight is pericarp 6 percent, endosperm 84 percent and germ 10 percent (Hubbard, Hall and Earle, 1950). In pearl millet, it is pericarp 8.4 percent, endosperm 75 percent and germ 16.5 percent (Abdelrahman, Hoseney and Varriano-Marston, 1984). The ratio of endosperm to germ in pearl millet is 4.5:1, while in the sorghum kernel it is 8.4:1. In finger and prove millets the germ is very small and therefore the endosperm-togerm ratio, 11:1 to 12:1, is much higher than in sorghum.
Pericarp
Pericarp is the outermost structural component of the caryopsis and is composed of three sublayers, namely epicarp, mesocarp and endocarp. The epicarp is further divided into epidermis and hypodermic. In the sorghum caryopsis, the epidermis is composed of thick, elongated, rectangular cells which have a coating of cutin on the outer surface. Often a pigment is present in the epidermis. The hypodermic is composed of slightly smaller cells than the epidermis and is one to three cell layers in thickness. The mesocarp, the middle part, is the thickest layer of the sorghum pericarp, but its thickness varies widely among genotypes. Mould resistance in sorghum is associated with thin mesocarp. Grains with thick mesocarp on a hard endosperm are preferred for dehulling by hand-pounding. The endocarp, the innermost sublayer of the pericarp, consists of cross cells and a layer of tube cells which transport moisture into the kernel. During dry milling of sorghum, the breakage occurs at
the cross and tube cell layers.

The pericarp of the pearl millet caryopsis consists of an epicarp with one or two cell layers, a mesocarp that varies in thickness because of genetic factors and an endocarp made up of cross and tube cells. The mesocarp layer of pearl millet does not contain starch granules; these are found only in sorghum mesocarp. During decortication or milling, the pericarp of pearl millet breaks at the cross and tube cell layers and fragments of endocarp may remain with the endosperm.
Seed-coat or testa
Just underneath the endocarp is the testa layer or seed-coat. In some sorghum genotypes the testa is highly pigmented. The presence of pigment and the colour are a genetic character. The thickness of the testa layer is not uniform. It is thick near the crown area of the kernel and thin near the embryo portion. In some genotypes there is a partial testa, while in others it is not apparent or is absent. In pearl millet the testa layer is thin and sometimes pigmented. In other millets the testa is always pigmented and is only a single layer thick. In finger millet the testa is very thick, with five cell layers, and is also pigmented.
Endosperm
The largest component of the cereal kernel is the endosperm, which is a major storage tissue. It is composed of an aleurone layer and peripheral corneous and floury zones. In all the millets and sorghum, the aleurone layer is a single layer of cells which lies just below the seed-coat or testa. The aleurone cells are rich in minerals, B-complex vitamins and oil and contain some hydrolysing enzymes.
The peripheral endosperm is distinguished by long rectangular cells which are densely packed and contain starch granules and protein bodies enmeshed in the protein matrix. The starch in these cells is therefore not easily available for enzyme digestion, unless the protein associated with it is also reduced (Chandrashekar and Kirleis, 1988). The matrix protein in general is alkalisoluble glutelin and the protein bodies are alcohol-soluble prolamins which account for the largest proportion of total protein in the kernel.
The protein bodies in the endosperm of sorghum and millets are spherical and differ in size among species and also within the endosperm of a single kernel. In sorghum the number of protein bodies decreases as the starch content increases from the peripheral zone to the central core where the floury endosperm is located. In pearl millet the protein bodies are more numerous in the floury than in the corneous zone. Adams, Novellie and Liebenberg (1976) have reported the presence of several enzymes, e.g. protease, 3-glucosidases, 3galactosidase and phosphatases, in the protein bodies of sorghum. The protein bodies of sorghum, pearl millet and finger millet also contain phosphorus, calcium, potassium and magnesium.
The starch granules of corneous endosperm are polyhedral and differ in size in different millet species. In floury endosperm the starch granules are spherical and bigger than the starch granules of the corneous zone. The starch in the floury zone is more amenable to enzyme digestion. In pearl and finger millets, the starch granules of the floury endosperm are spherical and big. The starch in pearl millet is hydrolyzed more slowly than that of sorghum by hog pancreatic amylase (Sullies and Rooney, 1977).
The proportions of corneous and floury endosperm determine the texture of the millet kernel. In soft-textured kernels there is more floury than corneous endosperm. In hard-textured kernels, on the other hand, there is more densely packed corneous endosperm than floury endosperm. Foxtail millet contains very little floury endosperm and is of a hard, corneous texture. Finger and prove millet kernels, with the endosperm evenly divided between the corneous and floury zones, are of intermediate texture. In pearl millet and sorghum the kernel texture varies widely, from all floury, very soft endosperm to all corneous, very hard or vitreous endosperm.
Grain texture is one of the most important determinants of the processing and food quality of sorghum and millets (Rooney, Kirleis and Murty, 1986). Hardendosperm sorghum when decorticated gives fewer brokers and more full grains than softer-endosperm sorghum (Desikachar, 1982). In dry milling, the flour yield is higher in corneous than in soft floury types. On the other hand, in wet milling the starch yield is higher in soft-endosperm genotypes. In the preparation of thick porridge, varieties with a higher proportion of vitreous endosperm are preferred. Such varieties are also suitable for popping (Chandrashekar and Desikachar, 1986; Murty, Patil and House, 1982). For preparation of bread, fermented or unfermented, the flour of soft-endosperm sorghum is highly preferred (Rooney, Kirleis and Murty, 1986).
Germ
The embryonic axis and the scutellum are the two major parts of the germ. The scutellum is a storage tissue rich in lipids, protein, enzymes and minerals. In pearl millet the ratio of germ to endosperm is larger than in sorghum and other millet kernels. The oil in the sorghum germ is rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids and is similar to corn oil (Rooney, 1978).

Chapter 2 - Production and utilization
The production and consumption data on sorghum and millets can be considered as only the best estimates that are available, as production data from small subsistence farms are difficult to obtain in any country. It is also likely that grain distribution and consumption throughout the semi-arid tropical regions vary widely among seasons, communities and families. Detailed and reliable data on the variety of products made from sorghum and millets and the prevalence of their use are either scanty or currently unavailable. One reason for the lack of information is the fact that to collect this information extensive surveys are needed. Several factors such as cost, time, labour, transportation and accessibility of villages in rural areas have to be considered before a survey is carried out. In several developing countries, inadequate infrastructure and other constraints have contributed to the lack of information on consumption of sorghum and millets.
Sorghum production
The total production of sorghum in the world in 1990 was 58 million tonnes, a decrease from 60 million tonnes in the year 1989 and 62 million tonnes in 1988 (FAO, 1991). A decrease in yield from 1 340 kg/ha in 1989 to 1 312 kg/ha in 1990 was reported, while the area remained around 44 million hectares in both years. Table 3 provides data on area, yield and production of sorghum in various regions of the world.
The five largest producers of sorghum in the world (Table 4) are the United States (25 percent), India (21 .5 percent), Mexico (almost 11 percent), China (9 percent) and Nigeria (almost 7 percent). Together these five countries account for 73 percent of total world production.
Of the total world area devoted to sorghum, over 80 percent is in developing countries. In Africa, sorghum is grown in a large belt that spreads from the Atlantic coast to Ethiopia and Somalia, bordering the Sahara in the north and the equatorial forest in the south. This area extends through the drier parts of eastern and southern Africa, where rainfall is too low for the successful cultivation of maize. Sorghum is the second most important cereal (after maize) in sub-Saharan Africa.

Because of higher yield per unit area, North and Central America produce the highest quantity of sorghum (37 percent of total production). In Central and South America sorghum is grown in the drier parts of Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala, Nicaragua, dry lowland interior areas of Argentina, dry areas of northern Colombia, Venezuela, Brazil and Uruguay. In North America, sorghum is cultivated in parts of the central and southern plains of the United States where rainfall is low and variable. Kansas, Texas, Nebraska and Arkansas are the major producing states, accounting for about 80 percent of total production in the United States.
In Asia, sorghum is extensively cultivated in India, China, Yemen, Pakistan and Thailand. Production in Europe is limited to a few areas in France, Italy, Spain and the southeastern countries. In Oceania, Australia is the only producer of significance; the production is concentrated in Queensland and northern New South Wales, where about 95 percent of the total crop is produced.
World sorghum production expanded from 40 million tonnes at the beginning of the 1960s to 66 million tonnes in 1979-81. However, by 1990 it had fallen to 58 million tonnes, though the area under sorghum declined only slightly, from 45.6 million to 44.4 million hectares, during the same period. The reduction in production from 1979-81 to 1990 was largely due to a decline in two major sorghum-producing countries, the United States and China. These two countries accounted for 6.2 million tonnes or 85 percent of the reduction in the global production figures. There are several reasons for the declining trend in the production of sorghum, including unpredictable and erratic distribution of rainfall (most of the sorghum grown is rain-fed), declining soil fertility, the inefficient production systems employed in individual countries, biotic and abiotic stresses and declining demand for sorghum. The growth in food demand (2.9 percent) for the period 1980 to 2000 in 90 developing
countries will marginally exceed projected agricultural production growth (2.8 percent) (FAO, 1981). However, the imbalance will be more pronounced in Africa (demand 3.4 percent, production growth 2.6 percent). In the least-developed countries, production growth is predicted to lag 25 percent below the growth of demand.

In 1987-89, vegetable products supplied the bulk of dietary energy (90 percent or more) and more than 80 percent of total daily protein in four of the ten major producers of sorghum in the world, namely, India, China, Nigeria and Burkina Faso (Table 5). In Mexico and the Sudan, vegetable products supplied more than 80 percent of dietary energy.

Sorghum utilization
Total consumption of sorghum closely follows the global pattern of output, since most of it is consumed in the countries where it is grown. Sorghum is used for two distinct purposes: human food and animal feed. Although in the early 1960s a very large part of the sorghum output was used directly as human food, its share has continuously declined since then. In fact, consumption of sorghum as animal feed has more than doubled, from 30 to 60 percent, since the early 1960s, while the volume of total food use has remained unchanged or has slightly declined (Table 6). In North and Central America, South America and Oceania most of the sorghum produced is used for animal feed.
