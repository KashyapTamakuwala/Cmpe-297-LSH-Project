<title>Graft-transmissible diseases of citrus. Graft transmissible diseases of citrus Handbook for detection and diagnosis</title>
<section>1</section>
Foreword
Chester N. Roistacher has been specializing in the detection and diagnosis of citrus virus and virus-like diseases for many years. During this time, he has developed a general philosophy on indexing that has led to the concept of the plant laboratory as a most important means of detecting several of the citrus virus and virus-like diseases.
The International Organization of Citrus Virologists, from its very inception, has had a history of international cooperation for the study, detection and ultimate elimination of citrus virus and virus-like diseases. Since its foundation over 30 years ago, one predominant principle has emerged: the problems related to citrus virology in one country, no matter how remote or distant that country may be, are similar to the problems in any other citrusgrowing country. Thus, the findings of workers in one institute are applicable and helpful to workers in another. This handbook exemplifies the spirit of cooperation that has prevailed in our organization in the sharing of knowledge among citrus scientists.
The importance of the practical applications of the material of this handbook might best be appreciated by relating the story of my own meeting and personal relationship with the author. I first met Chet Roistacher in1972 while working at the University of California in Riverside, attempting to define and improve the shoot-tip grafting method and to understand its mechanisms and principles. I had accumulated in test-tubes many hundreds of small plants. I had worked very hard during many long and late hours under a hood and using a microscope in cutting extremely small tips from their microscopic shoot apices, carefully grafting them to small, toothpicksized seedlings, and then putting the grafted seedlings back into the test-tubes. I was now ready to transplant these many small growing plants to the soil. However, past experience with other greenhouses led me to fear that, once these small plants were removed from their sterile and secure homes in the test-tubes, they might
easily be destroyed by phytophthora infection, poor soil or neglect. At this point I was introduced to Chet at the Rubidoux greenhouse, and he enthusiastically explained to me many of the concepts and principles now detailed in this handbook. Most important, he gave me hope and confidence that my many hard months of research would not be destroyed and we would have success with survival of my test-tube plants.
In truth, we achieved over 95 percent success in survival and growth of the plants which had been successfully transplanted to the UC soil mixture. We watched them grow from small, fragile plants just after the shock of transplanting to mature, vigorous plants in the greenhouse, and ultimately to fruiting trees in the field. I became a convert to this system of plant growth, which recognized the extreme importance of sanitation, nutrient balance, a good soil mixture with balanced fertilization plus responsible care. We later went on to index all of these shoot-tip grafted plants, and I was able to see and study at first hand the importance of good plants for the detection of citrus viruses. I also came to appreciate better the concept of the plant laboratory. I copied the formulae and concepts learned at Riverside and brought them back to Spain. At my request, Chet came to Spain in1975 to teach and to see if those principles, which worked so well at Riverside, would work
equally well in Valencia. They did!
Chet has always enthusiastically shared his knowledge with his many visitors from all over the world who go to the University of California at Riverside, in his many trips to most citrus-growing areas, and with all the members of the International Organization of Citrus Virologists. At the meetings of this organization, Chet has made many important contributions not only with his formal presentations of papers but also in his long discussions with everybody on the concepts and procedures for indexing citrus virus diseases.
Detection and diagnosis of graft-transmissible diseases of citrus is a most significant contribution to the citrus industries of all countries and for the advancement of citrus virus research. I feel it will be extensively used, both by new scientists entering this field and by scientists with wide experience in citrus virus diseases.
Finally, on behalf of the IOCV, I wish to acknowledge the wisdom and foresight of FAO in stimulating and supporting the publication of this handbook.

Preface
Citrus is one of the most important commercial fruit crops grown in all continents of the world, and areas under citrus are in continuous expansion. While citrus fruit contributes to the nourishment and refreshment of the people, citrus products and by-products provide the basis for local agricultural industries, generate employment, raise income and, in many cases, constitute an important source of foreign revenue to developing and developed countries.
As with any commercial crop, citrus is subject to various pest problems. These include insects, mites, fungi, bacteria, nematodes, viruses, viroids etc. that can cause varying degrees of damage and affect the quality and quantity of the produce on the one hand and the vigour and longevity of the trees on the other. Most of these pest problems can be solved in the field through conventional control measures, i.e. cultural practices, field sanitation, chemotherapy etc. Exceptions are problems posed by virus and virus-like diseases for which the only known cure is to provide healthy (virus-free) planting material, usually within the framework of a phytosanitation programme based on diagnosis, detection and elimination of the causal agent(s) and the maintenance and distribution of healthy stocks.
Detection of virus and virus-like diseases of citrus has significantly developed over the last half-century. At present, a wide variety of indicator plants exists for the detection of almost all known virus and virus-like diseases within a reasonably short time, provided that appropriate indexing facilities are available. In addition to biological indicators, many laboratory methods, ranging from culturing of the causal agent to molecular biologybased techniques, have also been developed during the last two decades. Such rapid detection methods are now used for quarantine purposes and large-scale surveys as well as for sanitation programmes in conjunction with biological assays.
When virus and virus-like diseases have been diagnosed by any of the above methods, and no source of healthy planting material is available, the only solution is to eliminate the infection from the diseased material. To accomplish this, various methods have been developed, including the production of nucellars, thermotherapy and shoot-tip micrografting. Such methods, used singly or in combination, have proved effective in eliminating virus and virus-like diseases, thus enabling the reutilization of valuable, sanitized resources.
The first attempt to collate information on detection techniques of citrus virus diseases was made over 20 years ago, when the United States Department of Agriculture published Indexing procedures for 15 virus diseases of citrus trees. This was prepared by the Committee on Indexing Procedures, Diagnosis and Nomenclature, established by the International Organization of Citrus Virologists (IOCV). With the continuing flow of knowledge and new findings on virus and virus-like diseases, the need for an up-to-date publication on detection techniques for citrus graft-transmissible diseases was expressed on various occasions. Such a publication was needed to assist in the detection of quarantine-significant citrus diseases before any introduction of citrus planting material; to help in conducting regular surveys to detect and avoid the potential spread of citrus vector transmitted diseases such as tristeza, greening and stubborn; and, more important, to aid the various national and
regional citrus sanitation programmes in the diagnosis and detection of citrus virus and virus-like diseases.
Realizing the importance of such a publication, FAO and IOCV cooperated in the preparation of this handbook on detection of citrus graft-transmissible pathogens. It was written somewhat in the form of a "recipe book" wherein all available knowledge on detection techniques is presented in the simplest and most straightforward way.
The handbook has been prepared by C.N. Roistacher, Emeritus Plant Pathologist of the University of California, Riverside, United States of America, who has devoted almost 40 years to the detection of citrus viruses and has played a significant role in the development of the California citrus clonal improvement programme. Other contributors to the handbook are scientists acknowledged as world authorities on the various detection techniques presented here. The author and most of the contributors are also members of the International Organization of Citrus Virologists. Without the dedication and generosity of all those who have voluntarily agreed to give their time and share their experience, this handbook would not have been written.
It is worth mentioning here that, although Part III of the handbook deals with laboratory detection techniques of citrus graft-transmissible pathogens, some of these techniques are also applicable to other viruses and virus-like pathogens of various field crops, vegetables, fruit trees and ornamentals.
As a follow-up to this handbook, and in order to make available to all interested parties the current technology on production of healthy citrus planting material, another publication on the elimination of citrus graft-transmissible pathogens is being prepared and will be published by FAO in due course.
Finally, it is hoped that this handbook will help to boost existing citrus phytosanitation programmes and will encourage the development of new citrus phytosanitation activities.

Introduction
This working handbook is designed to facilitate the detection of the major citrus graft-transmissible pathogens (CGTPs) and their associated diseases. Most aspects of detection are included. The primary object of this handbook is to enable users anywhere in the world to "see" or detect CGTPs, thereby assuring their elimination from citrus tissue. The ultimate objective is the elimination of these pathogens from propagative budwood and the establishment and maintenance of disease-free primary or foundation budwood source trees and nurseries to produce healthy, high-yielding citrus groves.
The importance of a good indexing programme as a means of identifying causal agents of transmissible diseases cannot be overemphasized. A prime responsibility of those in charge of a certification programme is the prevention of the distribution of thousands or millions of trees contaminated with pathogens via propagation of infected budwood. This handbook is an aid and guide toward reaching that goal.
Indexing may be defined as any test that will consistently confirm the presence or absence of a transmissible pathogen, or identify a disease. The index test should be specific for the pathogen or disease. Inoculation of plants is the primary means by which most graft-transmissible diseases of citrus are diagnosed (Table 3). Inoculation is primarily by graft-transmission, but can al so be effected by vector or mechanical transmission. Other approaches to indexing are direct observation of the pathogen in plant cells by light or electron microscopy, by microscopic observation of inclusion bodies or gum deposits within the plant cells, by antibody-antigen reaction, by analysis of pathogen-induced chemical changes, by culturing an organism, by observation of pathogen-specific nucleic acids via polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) or by molecular hybridization. Other indexing techniques involve detection of physiological changes, such as in water uptake or mineral content
of trees as used in testing for blight.
In general, any consistent, measurable or striking change in the morphology or chemistry of a plant brought about by the direct or indirect presence of a pathogen, or the direct observation of the pathogen, its by-products or constituents, can be considered as an index.
Many diseases can be diagnosed by specific field symptoms. Where these field symptoms are diagnostic, they are presented and illustrated. However, many graft-transmissible diseases are symptomless in commercial citrus, and these can be detected only by indexing.
The majority of the citrus diseases dealt with in this handbook are detected primarily by graft-transmission to indicator plants. Proven indexes are given in Part I. Some new detection techniques are mentioned under the heading of "Miscellaneous". These may be promising and useful but are not yet fully proved.
A listing of the indicator plants needed for a comprehensive indexing programme designed to detect the known major CGTPs reviewed in this handbook are given in Table 1. Other CGTPs not mentioned in this handbook (psorosis-like pathogens, Dweet mottle virus, yellow vein virus and other CGTPs) can also be detected by many of the listed indicator plants.

A controlled-climate greenhouse, i.e. a plant laboratory for the production and maintenance in isolation of indicator plants, is essential to any successful programme for detection and diagnosis of these diseases. Details for the plant laboratory and its requirements, together with grafting techniques and inoculation procedures, are given in Part II.
Detailed procedures and pertinent references for laboratory methods of detection of virus and virus-like diseases are given in Part III.
MAJOR GRAFT-TRANSMISSIBLE DISEASES OF CITRUS
The graft-transmissible pathogens of citrus have two general effects. Either they are destructive and cause sharp decline and death of the tree, or they do not kill the tree but cause severe stunting, loss of vigour, reduced fruit size and yield, and result in extensive long-term losses.
The major graft-transmissible diseases of citrus are presented below, based on economic impact and transmissibility:
o Diseases which induce severe loss and where vector transmission is known, i.e. tristeza, greening and stubborn, or which are suspected to be vector-transmitted, i.e. blight and related diseases.
o Diseases which induce moderate loss, are mechanically transmitted and also bud-transmitted or vectored by unknown means, i.e. exocortis, cachexia, satsuma dwarf, tatterleaf, infectious variegation and ringspot psorosis.
o Diseases which are readily controlled by use of virus-free budwood and are primarily bud-transmitted by humans, i.e. the psorosis-A family and the oak-leaf pattern family, including concave gum, impietratura and cristacortis.
o Diseases which are vector-transmitted but of minor economic impact, such as vein enation.
o Miscellaneous diseases and those of unknown etiology, i.e. gummy bark and abnormal bud-unions.
Table 2 lists these transmissible diseases of citrus grouped by causal agent (procaryote, virus, viroid etc.) and by primary mode of transmissibility (graft, vector or mechanical).
Vector-transmitted citrus tristeza and greening rank as the most serious and destructive of the citrus diseases. Where sour orange is the predominant rootstock and appropriate vectors are present, tristeza can spread rapidly and destroy an industry. Even where tristeza becomes endemic in an area and is contained by use of other rootstocks and cross-protection techniques, some of the stem-pitting forms can superimpose, decimate and destroy the industry. In many areas of the world, where greening has been introduced, citrus as a viable crop has declined. It is most important to understand the destructive potential of these two diseases and to develop every strategy to prevent, detect and destroy the pathogens before they can become established within an area, country or region. Recently, blight and related declines have inflicted severe damage on the industries of many countries, and some diseases, such as the Misiones disease or fruta bolita in northern Argentina, have
destroyed local industries.
Some of the graft and mechanically transmissible diseases of citrus such as tatterleaf, psorosis, ringspot and satsuma dwarf, are considered moderately destructive. Although they may severely limit crop production, these diseases can be readily detected in propagative budwood, are easily eliminated and their rapid spread curtailed. The mechanically transmitted viroid diseases, such as exocortis and cachexia, are destructive to certain varieties and, once introduced and established in a country, can spread relatively rapidly by mechanical means. These diseases can be readily detected by indexing and should not be permitted to enter expanding citrus industries of new or old regions.
Other citrus diseases, such as concave gum, cristacortis, impietratura, infectious variegation and vein enation, are generally less serious compared with the other diseases because they are relatively rare, do not cause severe effects or are spread only by grafting. Once eliminated from propagative budwood, they should not pose further problems.
Certain pathogens, once distributed throughout a region, are difficult to remove and may remain indefinitely with the citrus industry. Therefore, prevention by rigid quarantine should be the first priority. Detection by indexing and a programme for reducing inoculum, by either eradication or a certification programme, may have wide benefits.
BENEFITS AND OBJECTIVES OF INDEXING
The benefits derived from the development of an indexing programme will usually far outweigh the costs of development and maintenance of the programme. In those countries where no organized programme of testing has been established, most old-line citrus cultivars are infected with viruses, viroids or other graft-transmissible agents. Reports from Spain, Brazil, Florida and the Foreign Budwood Importation Program in California have shown that almost all citrus was infected with one or more CGTP.

The first benefit of a comprehensive indexing programme is accurate knowledge of the pathogens that are present in citrus within the country or area. This knowledge allows formulation of sound strategies in the development of a programme to avoid pathogens in propagative budwood.
One indirect benefit of establishing a comprehensive indexing programme is its potential for early discovery of introduced pathogens that could be highly destructive to citrus should they become disseminated via vector or budwood. In this world of rapid movement of people and plants by air transportation, budwood from other countries is continually being introduced by uninformed nursery staff and growers. This budwood can readily harbour pathogens potentially destructive to citrus. A well-equipped and properly staffed diagnostic laboratory can be a first line of defence for the rapid identification of these potentially destructive pathogens. If detected early, they may be eliminated before they can spread.
Perhaps the most rewarding aspect of a comprehensive indexing programme is the production of pathogen-free trees derived by shoot-tip grafting in vitro or by thermotherapy. Trees so produced are healthy, more uniform, higher-yielding with better coloured fruit, and ultimately more profitable to the grower. Those countries which have well-established indexing and certification programmes have demonstrated the economic benefits of such programmes to the grower. Production of disease-free trees requires the knowledge of which CGTPs are present and verification of their elimination by thermotherapy and/or shoot-tip grafting.
In summary, the ultimate objective or goal of any indexing programme should be the development of certified pathogen-free budwood to improve production in the industry, and also to have the means for detection of new, serious pathogens.
CONCEPTS IN DETECTION OF CITRUS GRAFT-TRANSMISSIBLE PATHOGENS
The visible diseases
Many CGTPs will induce specific symptoms in the field tree, and many of these symptoms are diagnostic for a specific disease. This handbook illustrates some of these field symptoms. However, the individual responsible for indexing should read and study the literature relative to each of the diseases. Although some pertinent literature is given with each chapter in this handbook, a study of the literature presented in all the volumes of the Proceedings of the International Organization of Citrus Virologists (IOCV) gives a more comprehensive and helpful reference guide. A historical review and bibliography for each of 14 diseases plus shoot-tip grafting is given by Roistacher (1988a). Recommended publications illustrating many of the citrus graft-transmissible diseases are: Bové and Vogel's Description and illustration of citrus virus and virus-like diseases (1980); the fourth volume of The citrus industry, containing articles by Wallace (1978) on citrus virus and virus-like
diseases and by Calavan et al. (1978) on registration, certification and indexing of citrus trees; and the Compendium of citrus diseases (Whiteside et al.,1988).
Diseases which may show characteristic and diagnostic symptoms in the field on certain varieties are cachexia, concave gum, cristacortis, exocortis, greening, infectious variegation, satsuma dwarf, psorosis-A, ringspot, stubborn, tatterleaf, tristeza and vein enation-woody gall (Table 3). However, clear diagnostic symptoms are not always obvious on infected trees in the field. It is very important to realize that trees infected with most of these same CGTPs are symptomless in various hosts and may show little or no diagnostic evidence of their presence in the field. Plants showing symptoms of one disease may also be infected with other pathogens. Thus, these CGTPs can unknowingly be spread throughout a country by bud-propagation or by mechanical or insect transmission. These are the "invisible diseases" which can be detected only by indexing.
The invisible pathogens
Most of the CGTPs listed in Table 3 exist in an invisible state in many citrus cultivars and can be detected only by indexing. Unless identified, the invisible pathogen can be readily spread in propagative budwood and can be distributed en masse within a country. The primary sources of infected budwood usually lie within the country, but with the current facility of air transport new, exotic and possibly destructive strains are being imported (often unwittingly) by nursery staff and growers.
