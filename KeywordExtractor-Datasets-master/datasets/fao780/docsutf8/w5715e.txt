Reasons for the inclusion in the PIC procedure
Formulations of the substance which exceed 600 g a.i./l are included because of their acute hazard classification and concern as to their impact on human health under conditions of use in developing countries (Fifth meeting of the Joint Expert Group).
There are several reports that the agricultural use of methamidophos causes health problems (China, Hong Kong, Korea). In the USA, methamidophos ranked second in percentage of cases displaying signs of life-threatening symptoms among occupational Poison Control Center cases, (see Annex 1).
In a study conducted by US-EPA regarding acute worker exposure risk assessment under conditions of use in Indonesia for chemicals of concern, a MOE-value (NOEL/Anticipated Exposure Level) of <1 was estimated for methamidophos. EPA generally considers a MOE of lower than 100 to present an unacceptable risk. (FAO Jakarta, 1996)
Registrars need to carefully consider the formulations actually used in each country when determining the risks of continued use of this pesticide. The toxicity of the active ingredient is high, but many formulations will fall into a much lower category of hazard.

Protective measures that have been applied concerning the chemical
Measures to Reduce Exposures
Personal
WHO recommends that for the health and welfare of workers and the general population, the handling and application of methamidophos should be entrusted only to competently supervised and well-trained applicators who must follow adequate safety measures and use the chemical according to good application practices. Regularly exposed workers should receive appropriate monitoring and health evaluations. (IPCS. 1993).
Protection
Protective clothing as indicated in the FAO Guidelines for Personal Protection when Working with Pesticides in Tropical Climates (FAO, 1990) is required; a respirator should also be worn by mixers and when spraying tall crops. The use of flaggers should be avoided; if used, they require full protective clothing, including a respirator. All equipment and protective clothing should be washed thoroughly after use; clothing should be laundered separately from family clothing.
Unprotected workers should be kept out of treated areas for 48 hours. (FAO, 1990)
Application
The manufacture, formulation, agricultural use and disposal of methamidophos should be carefully managed to minimize contamination of the environment. To minimize risks for all individuals, a 48-hour interval between spraying and re-entry into any sprayed area is recommended. Pre-harvest intervals have been set in many countries. These intervals vary from 3 to 90 days (most falling within 14-21 days), depending on the crop, harvesting technique and the country.
In view of the high toxicity of methamidophos, this agent should not be considered in hand-applied ULV spraying practices. (IPCS, 1993; FAO, 1995)
Regulatory measures
Although the chemical has been included in the PIC procedure because it is a highly toxic pesticide that is likely to cause problems under conditions of storage, transportation and use in developing countries, some countries have reported control actions that may be of interest when considering its use as a pesticide (see below).
Control Actions regarding methamidophos have been reported by Indonesia, Samoa and Sri Lanka (see Annex 2).
Liquid formulations with 40% or more methamidiphos are restricted in the United States to use by certified applicators.
Not all of the reports have been determined to be of control actions which conform with the FAO/UNEP definitions of banned or severely restricted for health or environmental reasons. However, all reports are provided here since the FAO/UNEP Joint Expert Group on Prior Informed Consent decided that the substance should be included in the PIC procedure due to its potential to cause problems under conditions of use in developing countries regardless of the number of qualifying actions.
For further information on the control actions provided in Annex 2, contact the Designated National Authorities (Annex 3) in the country reporting the control action.
Alternatives
Indonesia and Samoa have indicated alternatives to methamidophos (see Annex 2). Alternatives have been reported in literature. (Gips, 1990)
It is essential that before a country considers substituting any of the reported alternatives, it ensures that the use is relevant to its national needs. A first step may be to contact the DNA in the country where the alternative has been reported (see addresses of DNAs in Annex 3). It will then be necessary to determine the compatibility with national crop protection practices.
Packaging and Labelling
Follow FAO Revised Guidelines on Good Labelling Practice for Pesticides (FAO, 1995).
The United Nations Committee of Experts on the Transportation of Dangerous Goods (IPCS, 1993) classifies the chemical in:
Hazard Class 6.1
poisonous substance
Packing Group 2:
substances and preparations presenting a serious risk of poisoning (formulations containing 15 -100 % active material)
Packing Group 3:
harmful substances and preparations presenting a relatively low risk of poisoning(solid formulations containing 3-15% active material and liquid formulations containing 1.5-15 % active material)
Waste Disposal
All waste and contaminated material associated with this chemical should be considered hazardous waste. The material should be destroyed by incineration in a special, high temperature chemical incinerator facility.
See FAO Guidelines on Prevention of Accumulation of Obsolete Pesticide Stocks and The Pesticide Storage and Stock Control Manual. (FAO, 1996)
It should be noted that the methods recommended in literature are often not suitable in a specific country. High temperature incinerators or secure landfills may not be available.
Exposure Limits
Type of limit
Value
Food
MRL's (Maximum residue limits in mg/kg) in specified products (FAO/WHO, 1996)
JMPR ADI (acceptable daily intake) in mg/kg diet (JMPR, 1995)
First Aid
Early symptoms of poisoning may include excessive sweating, headache, weakness, giddiness, nausea, vomiting, hypersalivation, stomach pains, blurred vision and slurred speech. If these symptoms occur, the person should remove contaminated clothes, wash affected skin with soap and water, and flush with large quantities of water. If in the event of collapse artificial resuscitation is used, vomit may contain toxic amounts of the substance. In case of ingestion, the stomach should be emptied as soon as possible by careful gastric lavage. Do not induce vomiting if the formulation contained hydrocarbon solvents.
Persons who have been poisoned (accidentally or otherwise) must be transported immediately to a hospital and put under the surveillance of properly trained medical staff.
Antidotes are atropine sulphate and pralidoxime chloride.
General surveillance and cardiac monitoring must be maintained for at least 14 days. (IPCS, 1986)

2. Toxicity
2.1 General
Mode of action
Methamidophos affects the nervous system by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase, an enzyme essential for normal nerve impulse transmission.
Uptake
Methamidophos can be absorbed following ingestion, inhalation and skin contact.
Metabolism
Biotransformation in mammals results in the formation of metabolites that are toxicologically insignificant (IPCS, 1986; IPCS, 1993)
2.2 Known Effects on Human Health
Acute Toxicity
Symptoms of poisoning
The organophosphate insecticides are cholinesterase-inhibitors. They are highly toxic by all routes of exposure. When inhaled, the first effects are usually respiratory and may include bloody or runny nose, coughing, chest discomfort, difficult or short breath and wheezing due to constriction or excess fluid in the bronchial tubes. Skin contact with organophosphates may cause localized sweating and involuntary muscle contractions. Eye contact will cause pain, bleeding, tears, pupil constriction and blurred vision. Following exposure by any route, other systemic effects may begin within a few minutes or be delayed for up to 12 hours. These may include pallor, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal cramps, headache, dizziness, eye pain, blurred vision, constriction or dilation of the pupils, tears, salivation, sweating and confusion. Severe poisoning will affect the central nervous system, producing incoordination, slurred speech, loss of reflexes, weakness, fatigue,
involuntary muscle contractions, twitching, tremors of the tongue or eyelids, and eventually paralysis of the body extremities and the respiratory muscles. In severe cases there may also be involuntary defecation or urination, psychosis, irregular heart beat, unconsciousness, convulsions and coma. Respiratory failure or cardiac arrest may cause death.
Short and long term exposure
Some organophosphates may cause delayed symptoms beginning 1 to 4 weeks after an acute exposure that may or may not have produced immediate symptoms. In such cases, numbness, tingling, weakness and cramping may appear in the lower limbs and progress to incoordination and paralysis. Improvement may occur over months or years, but some residual impairment will remain.
Repeated exposure through inhalation, ingestion or through skin may gradually lead to signs and symptoms of inhibition of cholinesterase activity.
Excessive human exposure to methamidophos may cause delayed neuropathy. (IPCS, 1993)
Epidemiological studies
no data available
2.3 Toxicity studies with laboratory animals and in vitro systems
Acute Toxicity
(Tomlin, 1994; IPCS, 1993; FAO/WHO, 1993)
oral
LD[50] (a.i.; mg/kg b.w.): 10-50; in different test species
dermal
LD[50] (a.i.; mg/kg b.w.): 50-110; in different test species.
inhalation
LC[50] (a.i.; mg/m^3 air- exposure 4 hrs) 162; (rat)
irritation
Moderate erythema and oedema were observed in skin tests on the rabbit ear. The chemical is also irritating to the eye.
Short and long term exposure
The following levels were published as not to cause any toxicological effect; rat: 0.1 mg/kg bw/day: dog: 0.06 mg/kg bw/day; chicken 0.3 mg/kg bw/day. (IPCS, 1993)
A long-term study (500 days) on the effects of low doses of methamidophos on mice was conducted. Mice given 0.03 mg methamidophos/kg body weight still showed significant effects (reduced number of muscarinic receptors in the brain), which can be valued as an important influence on the central nervous system. (Tigges, 1994)
Effects on reproduction
In reproductive studies, several parameters were affected at relatively low levels. (IPCS, 1993)
Mutagenicity
Methamidophos was found to be non-mutagenic in bacterial and in vivo assays. (IPCS, 1993)
Carcinogenicity
There were no indications of oncogenicity in a mouse oncogenicity study or in a long-term toxicity/oncogenicity study on rats.
3 Exposure
Food
Use of methamidophos may result in low level residues; but there should be no health hazards if preharvest intervals are observed. (IPCS, 1993)
Since 1987 in Hong Kong, there have been numerous cases of acute poisoning following the consumption of green leafy vegetables imported from China. In Shenzen, where the bulk of these vegetables originates, it is strongly suspected that methamidophos has been used by some farmers and that the sprayed vegetables have been harvested too early before the residue levels have fallen to save levels. (Chan, 1994)
In the US, methamidophos was found at unacceptable levels in preschoolers diets in a 1989 study. The average intake as a percentage of the ADI was 5.763%. Between 63%-97.6% of 1-5 year olds were estimated to be receiving average daily exposures above the ADI (NRDC, 1989).
Occupational
Higher occupational exposure (mainly through inhalation and dermal absorption) may occur in the case of accidents or as a result of incorrect handling.
There are several reports on methamidophos indicating it may cause health problems during occupational use. In the US, methamidophos was judged third-highest among 28 pesticides on measures of occupational hazard. Methamidophos had the third-highest ratio of handler poisonings per 1,000 applications in California when exposures in mixtures were included, and the second-highest overall for field workers. Methamidophos ranked second in percentage of cases displaying symptoms or life-threatening symptoms among occupational Poison Control Center cases. (US-EPA, 1996)
In China, 27 provinces reported a total of 48,377 poisoning cases, including 3,204 fatalities in 1995. 15,300 of these cases were caused by normal agricultural use and not by accidents or improper use. More than 50 % of these 15,000 cases were attributed to parathion, methamidophos and omethoate (Shuyang Chen, Peipei Yao, 1996; Chan, 1996).
Environment
The population is not generally exposed to methamidophos in air or water.
Accidental Poisoning
Accidental poisoning with methamidophos may occur due to incorrect handling.
4. Effects on the Environment
Fate
Persistence
The half-life in soil is a few days. Degradation products are CO[2], mercaptan, dimethyl disulfide and dimethyl sulfide.
Bioconcentration
On the basis of data on the solubility of methamidophos, bioaccumulation would not be expected to occur.

Reasons for Inclusion in the PIC Procedure
The pesticide is included because of its acute hazard classification and concern as to its impact on human health under conditions of use in developing countries.
After review by the FAO/UNEP Joint Expert Group on PIC, it was decided that certain formulations of parathion methyl emulsifiable concentrates (EC) with 19.5%, 40%, 50%, 60% active ingredient (a.i.) and dusts containing 1,5%, 2% and 3% (a.i.) should be placed in that category. A typically used formulation is 50% EC which falls into WHO Class Ib, Highly Hazardous. Dust formulations were included for consideration even though in WHO Class III because of the great variation of concentrations and uncertainty over potential doses by inhalation, especially because formulations of this pesticide are produced by many manufacturers with varying degrees of control over the proportion of respirable particles.
Some reports attribute specific cases of poisoning to methyl parathion. These reports refer both to occupational exposure and accidental poisoning (See Annex 1, section 3 for details).
Registrars need to carefully consider the formulations actually used in each country in determining the risks of continued use of this pesticide. The toxicity of the active ingredient is high, but many formulations will fall into a much lower category of hazard.

Protective measures that have been applied concerning the chemical
Measures to Reduce Exposures
Personal
WHO recommends that for the health and welfare of workers and the general population, the handling and application of methyl parathion should be entrusted only to competently supervised and well-trained applicators, who must follow adequate safety measures and use the chemical according to good application practices. Regularly exposed workers should receive appropriate monitoring and health evaluation. (IPCS 1986, IPCS 1993)
Protection
Protective clothing as indicated in the FAO Guidelines for Personal Protections when Working with Pesticides in Tropical Climates (FAO, 1990) is required; a respirator should also be worn by mixers and when spraying tall crops. The use of flaggers should be avoided; if used, they need full protective clothing including a respirator. All equipment and protective clothing should be washed thoroughly after use; clothing should be laundered separately from family clothing.
Unprotected workers should be kept out of treated areas for 48 hours. (FAO 1990).
Application
The manufacture, formulation, agricultural use and disposal of methyl parathion should be carefully managed to minimize contamination of the environment. To minimize risks for all individuals, a 48-hour interval between spraying and re-entry into any sprayed area is recommended.
Pre-harvest intervals should be established and enforced by national authorities
In view of the high toxicity of methyl parathion, this agent should not be considered in hand-applied ULV spraying practices. (IPCS ,1993)
WHO concludes that with good work practices, hygienic measures and safety precautions, methyl parathion is unlikely to present a hazard for those occupationally exposed. DNAs evaluating the use of methyl parathion in a specific country will need to consider whether the necessary precautions can be ensured in the country as part of the risk assessment of the use of the methyl parathion formulations subject to this Decision Guidance Document. (IPCS, 1975; IPCS, 1986; WHO. 1993)
Regulatory measures
Although the chemical has been included in the PIC procedure because it is a highly toxic pesticide that is likely to cause problems under conditions of storage, transportation and use in developing countries, some countries have reported control actions that may be of interest when considering its use as a pesticide (see below).
Control actions regarding methyl parathion have been reported by Colombia, the Congo, Indonesia, Japan, Sri Lanka and Tanzania (see Annex 2).
Not all of the reports have been determined to be of control actions which conform with the FAO/UNEP definitions of banned or severely restricted for health or environmental reasons. However, all reports are provided here since the FAO/UNEP Joint Expert Group on Prior Informed Consent decided that methyl parathion should be included in the PIC procedure due to its potential to cause problems under conditions of use in developing countries regardless of the number of qualifying actions.
For further information on the control actions provided in Annex 2, contact the Designated National Authorities (Annex 3) in the country reporting the control action.
Alternatives
No information on alternatives has been provided by countries taking regulatory actions. Alternatives have been reported in literature. (Gips, 1990)
It is essential that before a country considers substituting any of the reported alternatives, it ensures that the use is relevant to their national needs. A first step may be to contact the DNA in the country where the alternative has been reported (see addresses of DNAs Annex 3). It will then be necessary to determine the compatibility with national crop protection practices.
Packaging and Labelling
Follow FAO Revised Guidelines on Good Labelling Practice for Pesticides (FAO, 1995).
The United Nations Committee of Experts on the Transportation of Dangerous Goods (IPCS, 1993) classifies the chemical in:
Hazard Class 6.1
poisonous substance
Packing Group 2
substances and preparations presenting a serious risk of poisoning, for formulations containing 12-100% methyl parathion
Packing Group 3
harmful substances presenting a serious risk of poisoning, for solid formulations containing 3-12% active material, and liquid formulations containing 1.2-12% active material
Waste Disposal
Avoid skin contamination and inhalation of vapour. Absorb spilled liquid and cover contaminated areas with a 1:3 mixture of sodium carbonate crystals and damp sawdust, lime, sand or earth. Sweep up and place it in an impervious container. Ensure that the container is tightly closed and labelled before transfer to a safe place for disposal. (IPCS, 1992)
Large amounts should be incinerated at high temperature in a unit with effluent gas scrubbing or should be adsorbed on vermiculite and disposed of in an approved landfill, if incineration is impossible. (IPCS, 1992)
See FAO Guidelines on Prevention of Accumulation of Obsolete Pesticide Stocks and The Pesticide Storage and Stock Control Manual. (FAO, 1996)
It must be considered that the methods recommended in literature often are not suitable in a specific country. High temperature incinerators or secure landfills may not be available.

First Aid
Early symptoms of poisoning may include excessive sweating, headache, weakness, giddiness, nausea, vomiting, hypersalivation, stomach pains, blurred vision and slurred speech. If these symptoms occur, the person should remove contaminated clothes and wash the affected skin with soap and water, and flush with large quantities of water. If in the event of collapse artificial resuscitation is used, vomit may contain toxic amounts of the substance. In case of ingestion, the stomach should be emptied as soon as possible by careful gastric lavage. Do not induce vomiting if the formulation contained hydrocarbon solvents.
Persons who have been poisoned (accidentally or otherwise) must be transported immediately to a hospital and put under surveillance of properly trained medical staff.
Antidotes are atropine sulfate and pralidoxime chloride.
General surveillance and cardiac monitoring must be maintained fo
