PREFACE
The magnitude of the forests contribution to the lives of rural people is now understood in general terms. The forest provides a wide range of direct and indirect benefits. However, to comprehend forest resources' contribution to communities' income and well-being, their individual and collective value must be accurately assessed on the local and regional levels. The Community Forestry Programme of the Planning and Institutions Service, Forestry Department is working to develop the understanding of the social, economic and cultural importance of non timber forest products in different regions throughout the developing world.
Evaluating the use of forest products will provide a solid base of knowledge. As such, this paper is a beginning; one which, it is hoped, will serve as an example for other regional studies that stress the importance of this type of information and provide a foundation upon which participatory development projects advocating multipurpose forest management can be designed. By implementing programmes that meet traditionally important needs, non-consumptive, sustainable use of forest land will become more attractive to forest users.
The research for this study was carried-out by Julia Falconer in West Africa, Paris, and at the FAO in Rome. Her work has greatly added to the understanding of the variety and range of products used in the humid zone of West Africa. The book was edited by Carla R.S. Koppell. Funding for this work was provided by the FAO/SIDA Forests, Trees, and People Programme. The Forest, Trees, and People Trust Fund Programme develops methods, approaches and tools that support rural peoples' efforts to improve their own well-being through tree and forest management. Within FAO the Programme is coordinated by Marilyn W. Hoskins, Senior Forestry Officer for Community Forestry, Planning and Institutions Service, Forestry Department.

INTRODUCTION
Forests have traditionally been valued as a source of timber, pulp, and, more recently, fuel. All other products, regardless of their value to local people or the national economy, have been classified by foresters as "minor forest products". Yet even this term (minor forest product) often refers only to those products for which there is an industrial market such as gums, resins and tannins. For rural West Africans from the forest region, the forests are valued for a vast array of products. They form an integral part of the household economy. Forests provide the resources for a multitude of products which feature in people's day to day lives. The West African humid zone region is extremely diverse incorporating many different political and economic systems, cultures, histories, and land use practices. The forests (and fallow land areas) are as diverse as the ways in which people use them. Forests provide food, medicines, household equipment and building material, raw
materials for processing enterprises, materials for agricultural and other production equipment, as well as products for cash sale. Forests and trees are also socially and culturally important, serving as temples, cultural symbols, social gathering places and locations for social rites such as initiation ceremonies. Forest products are used in support of other productive sectors such as agriculture, providing the materials used for making implements, harvest and market transportation equipment, crop storage containers, crop dryers as well as fuel used for crop processing.
Ceiba pentranda, the multi-purpose tree
The multitude of "minor" ways a single forest species may be used is well illustrated in an example from Ho, Ghana, where Ceiba pentandra's fibrous fruit are used in medicines, domestically for pillow-making and commercially sold to help plug up holes in canoes; its seed oil is taken against rheumatism, is sold commercially for soap making and is used as a fire-lighter; its leaves are consumed in soups and also provide goat fodder; its ash provides a good mulch; the bark and stem are used as a medicinal mouthwash; the roots are used in the treatment of leprosy. A favoured mushroom grows at its base. It is also valued as a bee fodder tree (for honey production). Finally, it is a sacred tree; its leaves and bark are believed to expel evil spirits (Asamoah 1985).
This study examines all forest products, both tangible and intangible, that are garnered from forests by local people both for home consumption and sale. The study refers to them as non-timber forest products (NTFP). NTFPs are therefore defined as those forest products, including by-products such as bushmeat and mushrooms, that are not processed by large forest industries. The boundary between cultivated and uncultivated forest land is often not distinct in this ecological zone; as a result the use of fallow land and on-farm trees will also be considered. Forest product processing by households and small enterprises is examined.
Finally, the study examines the ways that increasing population pressure, changes in agricultural and hunting practices, and increasing commercialisation are affecting forest areas, their use and utility. More intensive forest management systems geared to meeting the needs of local people are required. Yet, little is known about how forest resources are currently used and valued locally, nor about the impact of forest decline on households in this region. This study begins to bridge the knowledge gap that currently exists.

THE PURPOSE AND SCOPE OF THE STUDY
This study focuses on the following issues:
- How are forest resources used at the local level, and how do they contribute to the sustenance of the household?
- In what ways do different communities value (both tangibly and intangibly) forest resources in this region? How are these values changing with the extreme environmental and economic evolution taking place throughout the region?
- How has commercialisation of rural economies affected exploitation of forest resources?
Little information exists in the forestry literature to directly address these issues. However, as forest resources are used in so many ways, they are discussed (if somewhat incidentally) under many guises: evaluations, socio-economic surveys, market studies, food consumption surveys, ethnobotanic studies, studies of the "informal" sector, and studies of farming practices. Information can therefore be gleaned indirectly. For example, information on the forest products that are used for house construction can be found in housing surveys and socio-economic evaluations (which include information on different housing types and their prevalence); economic studies (which can estimate the costs of living and often include information on the quantity of material required (or costs) for different house types); ethnobotanic studies (which can also include information on the materials used for house building).
The study draws on research conducted in many disciplines: anthropology, botany, economics, ethnobotany, ethnomedicine, farming systems, forestry, wildlife management, geography, nutrition, and rural development. In addition, it includes information from a variety of different government agencies and ministries as well as in-country NGOs and international development agencies. It draws together this information to examine the practical and symbolic importance of forest resources to rural households. It assesses the kinds of information that are available, and explores the ways in which forestry activities could better incorporate the needs and interests of local people.
The study is divided into two parts. Part I serves two purposes. The first four chapters review what is known about the way people use and value the forests of the region. It divides the uses of forest products by function. The second set of three chapters is analytical in nature. It examines: the way forest product use has changed and is changing; how the importance of non-timber forest products can be assessed; and those forestry activities that could be developed in order to incorporate the values and needs of people.
This is followed by Part II, an extensive annotated bibliography that includes an overview of the literature and assesses the availability of information. More than 300 sources are reviewed to provide more specific information about the studies and publications that are cited in the text. As many of the information sources are unpublished and difficult to locate, these summaries will often be structured to serve as detailed outlines of the works.

1.1 The consumption of wild animals
1.2 Household consumption of forest plant foods
1.3 The use of forest resources in traditional medicine
1.4 Household consumption of fuelwood
1.5 Forest resources used for house construction
1.6 Household equipment and utensils made from forest products
There are a diverse range of ways the people from different parts of humid West Africa exploit their surrounding forests and fallow lands. Forests provide food, medicines, household equipment and building materials, raw materials for processing enterprises, and materials for agricultural and other equipment. While the extent of forest resource use varies by household in the region, it is clear from existing reports that forest products are still widely consumed. Regionally, bushmeat, palm products such as oil and wine (and in some regions other supplemental foods), medicines, fuelwood, and building materials are the most highly utilized forest products.

1.1.5 Regional variations in bushmeat consumption
Although foresters rarely consider animals forest products, for many rural people from the West African region wild animals (known as "bushmeat" throughout the region) are highly valued forest products. They provide an important source of meat in both rural and urban household diets. Forests and fallow field areas provide the habitat for many commonly consumed wildlife species. Additionally, they ensure stream habitats for freshwater fish and crustacea; and mangrove areas which are essential for coastal fisheries. Forest dependent animals are of particular importance in humid West Africa as substitutes for wild meat are often not available. (Tsetse flies (a carrier of the cattle disease trypanosomyasis) are endemic to this ecological zone and make cattle production difficult.) While many households already have a few domestic animals (such as goats, sheep or chickens), these animals are generally consumed only on ceremonial and festival occasions and do not supply a regular
source of food (Ajayi 1979, Asibey 1974, and deVos 1977).
It is clear from the available evidence that bushmeat has been and still is a major food item (contributing from 20% to 90% of the total animal protein consumed) for most rural West Africans from humid regions. (A summary of information arranged by country is presented in Table 1.) The importance of wild animal meat in the diets of both rural and urban dwellers varies considerably depending on the availability of supply. The consumption and value of bushmeat is rapidly changing in many regions because of increased demand from urban areas and dwindling supplies of wild animals in rapidly degrading rural environments. As a result, in many cases, bushmeat consumption is declining. In many urban areas it has become a luxury food. The most commonly consumed species are now fish, small mammals, reptiles, birds and insects, where formerly large mammals were also consumed.
There is a growing body of literature on the importance of bushmeat in the West African forest region. Information on consumption is often based upon an estimate of the number of people who consume bushmeat (e.g. 72% of Southern Nigerians consume giant rat (Ajayi et al 1974)) or the percentage contribution of bushmeat to the diet (e.g. in the Cameroonian forest zone, bushmeat supplies 70-80% of the annual animal protein (Prescott-Allen et al 1982)). These kinds of estimates give a general idea of the importance of bushmeat in a region but give little indication of their importance at the household level. In most cases data from household level nutrition and anthropological studies indicates that the quantity of bushmeat being consumed is small. Bushmeat does, however, have an important nutritional role in the diet. It adds flavor and diversity, and encourages people to consume greater quantities of staple foods while providing them with vitamins and minerals (Annegers 1973,
Laburthe-Tolra 1981).
Perhaps the most important measure of the local value of bushmeat comes from studies which ask people what they value most from forests. In an evaluation of the Subri forestry project in Ghana, Korang (1986) found that 94% of those surveyed considered the worst impact of forest conversion to be the loss of bushmeat in the area. Villagers remarked that this decline was caused primarily by the loss of wild animal food resources (conversion to a plantation lowered species diversity).

COUNTRY
SOURCE
BENIN
Bushmeat is preferred over domestic meat and is commonly sold in markets. Grasscutter is the most favoured and widely sold species. Giant rat is common, but less popular (Baptist and Mensah 1986).
CAMEROON
Ajayi (1979) reports that bushmeat provides 70-80% of the animal protein consumed annually in the southern forest regions. An estimated 2000 tonnes of bushmeat are consumed annually in the country (Balinga 1977). In the southern regions, wild game provides the main source of animal protein. On average, Cameroonians consume 2.5 kg./yr./capita (Belisle 1987). Gartlan (1987) reports that in 1981 Cameroonians ate an average of 9 grammes of bushmeat a day per capita. One village level study in southern Cameroon found bushmeat (including fish) to be the sole source of animal protein in the diet. It found that men in all the study villages hunt for home consumption (Faure et al 1980). Another village study in southern Cameroon found that hunting was still an important activity, especially during the rainy season. It notes that the most common hunting method is trapping. It adds that snails, caterpillars, ants, and other insects are regularly gathered and consumed (Amat et al 1972).
CENTRE AFRIQUE
In the Kwanga district, an estimated 300 tonnes of dried caterpillars are traded yearly. 30 different caterpillar species are consumed (Leleup et al 1969).
CÔTE D'IVOIRE
Bushmeat provided an estimated 70% of the annual protein consumed in the southern rainforest area before hunting was banned in 1974 (Asibey 1986). Lacrouts and Tyc (1961) estimated that people consumed 9.7 kg. of wild meat a year - more than the consumption of all domestic meat, chicken, and milk. In a study in Bongouanou, they found that people consumed on average 87 g./day/capita of bushmeat in their field camps and an average 32 g./day/capita in their villages. In this region alone, they estimate that 2,000 tonnes of snails are eaten annually. A more recent study showed that in rural areas bushmeat consumption is still important, an average 11.3 kg./yr./capita compared with 4.3 kg./yr./capita among urban consumers. The same study notes that production of bushmeat is still greater than total domestic meat production. Bushmeat prices in Abidjan are at least 80% higher than beef prices (Asibey 1986). The Ministry estimates the total value of bushmeat in the southeastern
rural region at FCFA 630.4 million. Smoked bushmeat is far more common than fresh meat (an estimated value of FCFA 385 million, compared with FCFA 172 million) (Ministère des Eaux et Forêts, Côte d'Ivoire 1987).
GHANA
Approximately 75% of the population regularly consume wild animals, mainly game meat, fish, insects, caterpillars, termites, and snails (Asibey 1986). The Department of Wildlife and Game estimates that 80% of the rural population depend on game meat (Asibey 1987b). The most commonly consumed species are small animals such as grasscutter and duiker (Asibey 1978). For example, approximately 62,000 grasscutters were sold over a six year period in one Accra market (Asibey 1986). In two southern districts, Asibey (1986) reports that bushmeat contributed 44% and 31% of the protein consumed (fish contributed 35% and 31%, respectively). In a six year survey of one Accra market, Asibey (1987a) reported that a minimum 79,000 kg. of bushmeat was traded every year. Approximately 52,500 kg. of bushmeat was sold in a single Accra market in 1985 (Ntiamoa-Baidu 1987). Bushmeat is consumed in urban as well as rural Ghanaian households: for the country as a whole an average, 1.8 g. of
bushmeat is consumed per capita per day (Clottey 1969). Asibey (1974) estimates daily consumption at 1.7 g. for bushmeat and 1.6 g. for domestic meat. Clottey (1969) asserted that 61% of the animal protein consumed in Ghana came from "wild" sources which included both fish and game. A nutrition study conducted in 1968 estimated that Ghanaians consumed 9 g. of bushmeat and 1 g. of snails daily per capita in rural forest areas, 1 g. of bushmeat and 9 g. of snails per capita daily in coastal areas, and 8 g. of snails per capita per day in urban areas. The study estimated that the total annual consumption of bushmeat was 27,700 tonnes (Genelly 1968).
LIBERIA
Bushmeat contributes between 80 and 90% of the animal protein consumed throughout this country (Ajayi 1979). Another study estimates its contribution to be 60-70% (Sale 1981). Small antelopes and various species of monkeys are the most popular species (Jeffrey 1977). Robinson and Peal (1981) note that there are no controls on hunting and wildlife resources are being rapidly depleted. Bushmeat is even imported from Sierra Leone and Guinea.
NIGERIA
The Federal Department of Forestry (1987) notes that wildlife is most highly valued as food. A number of studies have been conducted in Nigeria on bushmeat consumption. For example, Ajayi (1971) estimates that 80% of the people in southern regions consume bushmeat and that bushmeat supplies an average 20% of the animal protein consumed. Based on results from a market survey, some 53% of rural people and 40% of the urban population consumed bushmeat regularity (more than once a month) (Martin 1978). In another survey, Martin (1983) found that 95% of the people consumed bushmeat.
The most commonly consumed species are small animals. In a study of roadside bushmeat markets in Benin state, Nigeria, Martin (1978) found that grasscutter and small antelopes were most commonly sold. Ajayi and Olawoye (1974) learned that giant rat was consumed by the majority of both urban and rural people. And Akande (1979) found that 93% of those surveyed in the southwest like bush fowl (francolins). In another study of bush fowl consumption, Ayeni (1980) asserts that 79% of the people that were interviewed consumed guinea fowl. He estimates that there are 44 million semi-domesticated guinea fowl in Nigeria.
In rural areas the consumption of bushmeat is closely associated with the conditions of the surrounding forest resources. For example, Charter (1973) discovered that in Onitsha, a densely populated region with few forests, bushmeat contributes only 7% of the total meat consumed, whereas in forested regions, bushmeat provides the majority of meat consumed: 82% in Benin and 84% in Oyo.
In a recent study of meat consumption in southern Nigeria, Dietworst (1987) found that snails were regularly consumed (several times a week) by more than a third of the households interviewed in one community, while in another community in Oyo state, 80% of the households consumed bushmeat at least several times a month and 20% consumed it daily. However, bushmeat and snail consumption is less common in a third Oyo community. In 1983, Ajayi reported that average bushmeat consumption increased from 10.1 g./capita in 1968 to 13.2 g./capita (or an estimated 421,000 tonnes a year) in 1980. Olatunbusom (1972) estimates bushmeat supplies an average 9.7 g. of protein per capita per day and fish supplies 29 g. of protein per capita per day in rural areas. In an interesting study on the quantities of bushmeat produced by farmers in three different ecological zones, Adeola and Decker (1987) found that an estimated 1,320,000 tonnes of bushmeat were produced over a six month study
period.
SENEGAL
Cremoux (1963) estimates a minimum consumption rate of 373,600 metric tonnes of wild mammals and birds per year. Vincke, Singleton, and Diouf (1987) found that the Sereer (Sine region) consume an average 12.9 g. of bushmeat per person per day. The most commonly consumed animals were birds. They note that children consume the greatest quantities of bushmeat.
SIERRA LEONE
Bushmeat was once a staple food in the Sierra Leonian diet. However, wildlife has become scarce in all regions of Sierra Leone and, as a result, it is less regularly consumed. Nonetheless, it is available in most rural and urban markets (Teleki et al 1981). A farming survey revealed that 22% of the households considered hunting an important off-farm activity and 40% considered fishing an important off-farm activity. According to a household nutrition study bushmeat is consumed by an estimated 55% of all Sierra Leonian households (Smith 1979). It notes that bushmeat and fish are the most common sources of animal protein.
TOGO
Den Hartog and deVos (1973) report that the estimated per capita consumption of rodent species in rural regions ranges from 0.5 g. to 12 g. per day.
1.1.1 Commonly consumed bushmeat species
By most accounts, the availability of game meat has declined in most parts of the West African region because of dramatic changes in the rural wildlife habitat and over-hunting. This is a result, in part, of an expanding urban market for bushmeat (Ajayi 1971, 1978, Asibey 1977, 1986, Blanc-Pamard 1979, Federal Department of Forestry, Nigeria 1987, Jeffrey 1977, Ntiamoa-Baidu 1987, Teleki et al 1981). Larger game species are no longer available (with the exception of some regions of Cameroon and some remote forest regions). As a result, the range of species that are consumed has increased (Asibey 1965, 1974); this indicates that people have become less selective about the types of wild animals they consume. Although taboos and restrictions prevent consumption of specific species by certain groups, over the region as a whole all types of animals are exploited for food.
The most commonly consumed species are small mammals such as the grasscutter and other rodents, duikers and other small antelopes, monkeys (where they are still plentiful), bushfowl, and reptiles. Grasscutters and other rodents have proven to be well-adapted to heavy exploitation (Asibey 1986, Ntiamoa-Baidu 1987, Jeffrey 1977, Martin 1983). In fact, the natural range of the grasscutter has increased with increased opening of forest areas (Asibey 1986). These small animal species are naturally more plentiful than larger species, as they have higher reproductive rates. Furthermore, hunting them is rarely restricted by protection laws (deVos 1977).
A study of farmers' hunting in different areas of Nigeria shows that the most commonly hunted species are bats, giant rat, grasscutter, squirrels, guinea fowl, lizards and snakes (Adeola and Decker 1987)'. Asibey's market studies in Ghana reveal that grasscutter is the most commonly marketed species (1965, 1974, 1987). In Senegal, birds are most commonly consumed (Vincke, Singleton, and Diouf 1987). Finally, in the forest zone of Côte d'Ivoire, duiker, squirrel, porcupine and rodents are the most commonly hunted (Blanc-Pamard 1979). (See Appendix 1 for a list of species commonly exploited in the region.)
1.1.2 The consumption of gathered animal resources
Many authors note that gathered animals (as opposed to hunted species) such as snails, turtles, termites, caterpillars and other insects also contribute significantly to the West African diet (Ajayi-1971 in Nigeria, Asibey 1974 in Ghana, Blanc-Pamard 1979 in Côte d'Ivoire, Dietworst 1987 in Nigeria, Dongmo 1985 in southern Cameroon, deVos 1977). Their consumption is only occasionally recorded, even in nutrition studies (Annegers 1973). They are especially valued for the flavouring and diversity they add to the diet (1973, Laburthe-Tolra 1981).
Some authors mention that these small animals are often eaten as "snacks" that are especially favoured by children. Children frequently catch and consume small animals such as insects, birds, and rodents (Blanc-Pamard (1979), Vincke et al 1987).
Snails are perhaps the most popular and widely consumed forest animals throughout the West African forest zone. They command high market prices in Côte d'Ivoire (Lacrouts and Tyc 1961), Nigeria (Martin 1983), and Ghana (Asibey 1986). In the southern part of Nigeria snails are the most popular "meat" consumed (Ajayi 1971). They are generally consumed during the rainy season. In a recent household study in southern Nigeria, Dietworst (1987) found that, in one community, snails were consumed regularly (several times a week) by more than a third of the households, and monthly by more than two thirds of the households.
1.1.3 The nutritional value of bushmeat
Many researchers emphasise the importance of bushmeat as a source of animal protein (Olatunbosum et al 1972, Asibey 1986, Ajayi 1979, Belisle 1987). Though there is little data on the nutritional composition of commonly consumed bushmeat species, what is known suggests that bushmeat provides an equivalent and in some cases greater quality food than domestic meats (see Appendix 2). Ajayi (1979) notes that wild animals are good sources of carbohydrates (ranging from 1% in river hog to 6% in forest genet) compared with domesticated animals from similar environments (ranging from 0.8% in pork and beef to 1.3% in mutton). He adds that the protein content of bushmeat ranges from 16-55% (compared to 11-20% for domestic animals). Snails, for example, provide a good source of protein, are low in fat, and are exceptionally high in iron, calcium and vitamin B. In addition, bushmeat is often a good source of minerals and vitamins. Generally, however, wild animals foods are consumed in
very small quantities; thus their contribution to overall protein needs may be minimal.
In a study examining the nutritional importance of forest foods, Hladik (1987) argues that bushmeat provides, most importantly, calories. Many highly prized bushmeat species are preferred for their fatty consistencies. In Southern Cameroon domestic meat is only consumed on festive occasions, whereas bushmeat supplies a regular source of food (Hladik 1987).
1.1.4 Seasonal changes in bushmeat consumption
Hunting and bushmeat collection are seasonal activities reflecting both seasonal availability of forest products and seasonal variations in agricultural labour requirements. Throughout the West African region, greater quantities of bushmeat are generally consumed during the rainy season than in the dry season (Hladik et al 1987, Dongmo 1985). In Southern Cameroon Amat and Cortadellas (1972) found that hunting (especially with traps) was most common during the rainy season. Gathering of animal foods and fishing (both generally women's activities) were also at their height during this time.
For many rural male farmers hunting is an important activity during the off-peak agriculture period. In Casamance, Senegal, Pélisser (1966) found that hunting was an important activity both for home consumption and bushmeat sale during the agricultural slack period. In Zaire, hunting is at its peak in the slack period in agriculture and is least common during the planting season (Mankoto ma Mbaelele et al 1987).
It should finally be noted that some forest animal products are only available seasonally; for example snails are available only in the rains (Dongmo 1985) while caterpillars are generally collected in the dry season (Hladik et al 1987). In his study of the Cameroonian pygmies, Bahuchet (1978) found that hunting techniques and hunted species varied by season.
1.1.5 Regional variations in bushmeat consumption
There are great regional variations in bushmeat consumption. Variations result primarily from differences in availability. Thus, the conditions of the forest resource have a direct impact on bushmeat consumption (deVos 1977). In Nigeria, where wild game is available, it supplies a great portion of the meat people consume (see Table 1). Similarly, in Cameroon, bushmeat contributes an estimated 70-80% of the total annual animal protein consumed in the southern forest region, compared with 2.8% for the country as a whole. In a consumer survey in southern Nigeria, Martin (1978) found that 62% of the rural and urban people interviewed stated that the lack of bushmeat limited their consumption.
Consumption also varies from village to village and household to household. Dietworst's (1987) meat consumption survey in Nigeria showed that bushmeat preferences, purchasing, and consumption varied considerably not only village to village but also household to household. (See also Orraca-Tetteh (1987) for similar information on Ghana.)
Conclusion
There are few studies which focus on the frequency with which bushmeat is consumed (such as Dietworst's study) or on the nutritional importance of bushmeat in the diet (e.g. Hladik study). General consumption figures can only be taken as indicative; they do not elucidate the role of bushmeat in the household diet. However, the information that is available does demonstrate that wild animal resources are still important components of the majority of rural and urban consumers' diets. The most commonly consumed animals are rodents such as grasscutters and antelopes such as duiker; bushfowl and snails are also extensively consumed. Smoked and fresh fish are the most common source of protein throughout the region. Generally, fish is consumed daily in small quantities (Orraca-Tetteh 1987). It is not, however, possible to distinguish between consumed species which are dependent on forest habitats, and those that come from other environments. In most areas bushmeat is preferred over
domestic varieties of meat, but its consumption is limited by dwindling availability and high market prices.

1.2.2 The contributions of forest foods to diets
1.2.3 Oil palm foods
1.2.4 The seeds of Irvingia gabonensis
There are vast numbers of edible plant products garnered from forests, including seeds and nuts, leaves, fruits, roots and tubers, fungi, and salt. Collectively they add diversity and flavour to the diet while providing protein, energy, vitamins and essential minerals. The contribution of forest foods to diets varies considerably from region to region. Throughout West Africa, however, they supplement staple foods and are consumed during seasonal food shortages when agricultural crop supplies dwindle. Forest foods, especially leaves and nuts, supplement rural diets by contributing to sauces that accompany carbohydrate staples. Some forest fruits are often consumed throughout the day as snacks. They also supply buffer food sources during emergency periods (Irvine 1952, Okigbo 1986). In some regions, forest species that are valued for their food products are protected in farm and fallow fields (see Appendix 3 for a list of commonly consumed forest species).
There is a great deal of descriptive information available on edible forest foods (Okigbo 1985, 1986, Gbile 1983, Irvine 1952, Ake Assi 1984, Abbiw 1989). However, few studies have attempted to examine the frequency with which foods are consumed, the nutritional value of various foods, the prevalence of foods' use, or how resident populations value foods. There are a few household level analytic studies which help to illustrate the importance of these resources to local populations (Department of Forest Resource Management 1986, Hladik et al. 1987, Koagne 1986, Okafor 1981, O
