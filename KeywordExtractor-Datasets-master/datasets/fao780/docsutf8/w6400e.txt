Why Forest Energy Forum? The motivations are many. First, we want to offer our readers and colleagues a new quick and direct source of information on wood energy. Second, we wish to establish a simple mechanism for dialogue (south-south and north-south), which is the reason why we have adopted the word "forum" for this newsletter. We hope that through Forest Energy Forum readers from different disciplines and sectors concerned with wood energy can express their views and disseminate their experiences for the benefit of their wood energy colleagues and also their community in general.
The materialization of these ideas has led us to forfeit our Energy Corner in Non-Wood News and to create a sister newsletter, Forest Energy Forum, with which we hope to achieve the above-mentioned objectives and through which we wish to reach all our readers and colleagues in the sector while building a multisectoral dialogue between the different actors from all the disciplines in the wood energy field.
The findings derived from our publications and studies, among which is Wood energy today for tomorrow (WETT), show that wood energy continues to make a large contribution to the energy sector and is a vital ingredient in meeting the energy needs of millions of people in developing countries. However, the most relevant factor is that there is increased interest in wood energy from the industrial and commercial sectors of developed countries because it is renewable, competitive and environmentally friendly.
In fact, nowadays there are different initiatives for new projects, offers of novel technologies and technical assistance within the forestry and agro-industrial sectors where wood fuels alone, and/or combined with by-products derived from their production processes, are becoming an attractive source of thermal and/or electrical energy, and any surpluses can be sold to the energy market as another commodity with benefits for all involved. The case of two Nicaraguan sugar mills (which will be described in detail in the next issue of Forest Energy Forum) is a good example of the changes occurring in the sector. Such is the importance of this subject that it was the main item discussed during the meeting of the national coordinators of the Latin American Technical Cooperation Network on Dendroenergy, held in Cuba from 4 to 7 November 1997.
The use of forest fuels offers interesting synergies which make them a competitive source of energy, even with the present oil prices. But the many interrelations, both within and outside the forestry and energy sectors, constitute a complex system (sometimes not properly known) which hampers its massive utilization. Forest Energy Forum wishes to clarify these important interrelations in order to promote sustainable forest management.
The development of wood energy initiatives involves many disciplines, including the forestry and energy sectors, and the areas of climatic change and rural development. Unfortunately, good and effective channels of communication have not yet been developed, which is another drawback affecting the development of wood energy initiatives. With Forest Energy Forum we hope to create a constructive dialogue among the main actors of the different wood energy sectors and disciplines.
FAO, through the Wood Energy Programme of its Forestry Department, has been actively involved in this process for many decades. It has provided technical assistance to member countries for the promotion of sustainable production, equitable market structures and rational utilization of wood fuels as a renewable, locally available source of energy for use in the residential, commercial and industrial sectors. Through Forest Energy Forum, we are pleased to continue with our efforts and our modest contribution to the development of this old, but completely renovated, source which is gradually receiving the attention it deserves.
In this way, the experience shared with our colleagues of Non-Wood News, through its four issues published since 1994, is consolidated and expanded through Forest Energy Forum in the hope of reinforcing our contribution and making a new energy and forestry order that is more in tune with society's needs - an aim we all desire.
We would like Forest Energy Forum to become a regular meeting point every six months. Meanwhile, we wish to maintain contact between one issue and the next. Please send your comments, ideas, new experiences, projects and information either through our Internet web page, or by E-mail, fax or simply by letter to the address below. We look forward to hearing from you!

Wood energy today for tomorrow (wett)
During the activities of the current biennium, we decided to carry out a qualitative and quantitative study of the past and present consumption of wood fuel at the national level for the most relevant regions. The study was based on information and statistical data available in the most relevant databases of the organizations and agencies involved in this field, at the global as well as the regional level, in order to overcome the main problems derived from lack of or insufficient data in this sector.
We established regional studies, Wood energy today for tomorrow (WETT), aimed at revising data on wood fuel utilization in order not only to assess the actual contribution of forests, woodlands and trees to the energy sector, but also to scrutinize the possible future contribution of forest biomass to the energy sector - an energy sector which is ever thirsty for more energy to support the process of globalization, especially in some emerging countries of Asia and Latin America.
We also felt that these studies could help identify the main data gaps, weaknesses and inaccuracies of the present statistical databases available in different regional (the Latin American Energy Organization [OLADE], the Asian Institute of Technology [AIT], Environment and Development in the Third World [ENDA], etc.) and international organizations such as FAO (Forest Products Yearbook), the UN (Energy Statistics Yearbook) and the International Energy Agency (IEA) and thus identify the action required to tackle these information gaps. In addition, this analysis could also lead to the identification of several important aspects and issues concerning the main users in different sectors and supply sources.
The results of the first regional study undertaken are described in the document Background overview of available data on wood energy in Europe and OECD countries which gives an overview and comparison of available data on wood energy in FAO, the UN Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), the Statistical Office of the European Communities (EUROSTAT), the International Energy Agency (IEA) and the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in Paris.
The main results of this analysis are compiled in eight tables for each organization covered (a total of 40 tables), in order to facilitate mutual comparison of data available for 42 countries grouped as follows: the European Union (EU), OECD non-Europe and Europe non-EU countries. Based on the data collected, a best estimate was made on the use of wood energy for the three country groups.
The data collected led to the preparation of another technical document, The role of wood energy in Europe and OECD countries, which clearly shows that wood energy accounts for approximately 3 percent of the total primary energy supply in the 15 EU countries. However, in Sweden and Finland this reaches more than 16 percent and in Austria 13 percent.
In general, in all the groups examined, approximately 30 to 50 percent of the total wood removed from forests is ultimately used for energy purposes, of which only a small amount is directly derived from the forests; a large amount of wood fuels is derived from other sources, such as forest industry by-products, black liquor from pulp and paper industries and recovered wood.
It should also be noted that in most of the countries analysed, wood fuel is still mainly used in households, with the exception of Sweden and Finland where industrial wood energy constitutes an important contribution to the final energy mix.
Other regional WETT studies covering countries in Asia and Latin America have already been carried out. Draft documents describing the information collected and the main findings are currently being edited. More detailed information on these studies will be provided in future issues of Forest Energy Forum.
Unified wood energy terminology (uwet)
A careful analysis of the wood energy data available in different organizations and agencies has been carried out through the above-mentioned WETT studies, even though it has been difficult (and in some cases almost impossible). Much has been learned, on which we need to reflect carefully, but a lot of work still needs to be done in order to improve our wood energy database and information systems.
From this analysis, we would like to bring to your attention the following three main topics which have direct implications on our future activities:
* The wood energy statistics for the EU provided in the FAO Forest Products Yearbook are considerably lower than those provided by UNECE and EUROSTAT. The main explanation for these tremendous differences is that FAO includes only wood fuels (fuelwood and charcoal) directly removed from the forests, without taking into consideration wood fuels from non-forest lands.
* In other cases, the data (when available, i.e. from EUROSTAT) are highly aggregated, which makes it not only difficult to know what kind and type of biomass is used, but also extremely difficult to compare the data with those from other sources.
* In view of the considerable variety of terms, units and conversion factors used for the collection, processing and presentation of wood energy data, it is not easy to compare and exchange information among the different organizations involved.
These three issues have led us to revise our wood energy figures and the mechanisms for their collection, processing and presentation. One of the first steps adopted by the Wood Energy Programme has been the preparation of what we call UWET (unified wood energy terminology), which also includes definitions, units and conversion factors.
We are making considerable progress in this area. A preliminary draft has already been sent to a small group of individuals from different international organizations for their views, opinions and comments. More details on this crucial subject will be provided in future issues of Forest Energy Forum.

Earth Summit
One of the results of the Special Session of the UN General Assembly, which met in New York in June 1997 to assess the progress made since Rio, is a new intergovernmental panel on forests called the Intergovernmental Forum on Forests (IFF), which has been established under the aegis of the UN Commission on Sustainable Development with a secretariat based in New York.
Sustainable development: development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs ...
The following extract is taken from the text on Forests which was adopted at the Special Session of the General Assembly.

Latin American Technical Cooperation
Network on Dendroenergy (land)
The Technical Cooperation Networks are mechanisms established by national institutions, either public or private, aimed at the exchange of experiences and knowledge among the countries, basically by making use of their own technical, human and financial resources.
In view of the necessity to establish a broad basis of cooperation on dendroenergy in the region, owing to the importance of wood as a source of energy for domestic and industrial use, LAND was formally established in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in October 1984, with the initial participation of nine countries. The first Regional Coordinating Institution of the Network was the Instituto Nacional de Tecnología Industrial (INTI) of Argentina, followed by the Escuela Superior Politécnica del Litoral (ESPOL) in Guayaquil, Ecuador. Since 1995, the regional coordinating institution has been the Escola Federal de Engenharía de Itajuba (EFEI) in Itajuba, Brazil.
To date, 16 countries have joined the Network: Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Costa Rica, Cuba, Chile, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Peru and Uruguay.
The Network is composed of national institutions (one for each country) that undertake activities in the field of dendroenergy. In general, these institutions are of a governmental nature; however, non-governmental institutions may also be members of the Network, if so determined by the respective countries.

Biomass Summer School, Austria
Graz University of Technology (Austria), together with the Austrian Biomass Association and the Austrian Ministry of Science and Transport, organized the Second Biomass Summer School at Graz University of Technology from 8 to 12 September 1997. Attendance was limited to 35 participants from all parts of the world.
The topics discussed covered the most important points of energy production from biomass: the characterization of biomass fuels, pretreatment technologies, the conversion steps combustion and gasification, possibilities of small-scale combined heat and power production, the production and utilization of biofuels (RME, AME and ethanol), as well as environmental aspects. Lectures focused on important new developments, such as biomass pellet production, a new technology for efficient dust precipitation (the rotational particle separator), gas engines, biomass fuel engines and an innovative technology for small-scale CHP systems (the screw-type engine). A field trip demonstrating thermal biomass utilization as well as RME and AME production from biomass in practice closed the one-week seminar.
The Third Biomass Summer School will take place in 1998, and there are also plans to organize a Biomass Summer School in Latin America during 1998.

World Energy Council
The Developing Countries Committee agenda, at its meeting at Kusadasi, Turkey, on 7 October 1996, included a forum on rural energy development. Speakers included Francisco Guitierrez, former Executive Secretary of OLADE, on the rural energy situation in Latin America, and Gerald Leach of the World Bank on the findings of the Bank's study, Rural energy development: improving energy supplies for 2 billion people. Regional coordinators will present their draft chapters for the rural energy study at the next meeting of the Steering Committee. The study report is due to be completed before the 1998 World Energy Council Congress in Houston, Texas, United States. (Source: Bulletin d'Information [World Energy Council], Issue 3, March 1997.)
FORESTS FOR ENERGY
(Extracted from World Food Summit Fact Sheet The role of forests in food security)
Wood energy is drawing increasing attention as an environmentally friendly source of energy. Wood is still people's main source of fuel for cooking, processing and preserving food, and will continue to be for many years to come. Worldwide, 2 000 million people depend on wood for cooking, a basic step in ensuring proper nutrition. In many developing countries, fuelwood supplies as much as 97 percent of total energy consumption. Wood-based energy systems are the most readily available in many areas and, when properly managed, they are not only versatile and sustainable but also effective in generating income and jobs.
Des résidus source d'énergie
Désireuses de disposer de leurs résidus selon un objectif de développement durable, les papeteries utilisent à des fins énergétiques des écorces, des résidus de sciage, la liqueur issue de la cuisson des copeaux ou encore des résidus provenant du désencrage des papiers rebuts et du traitement des eaux de procédés. Selon une étude récente, les papeteries et les scieries québécoises engendrent annuellement plus de 4 millions de tonnes d'écorces, de sciures, de planures et de boues qui peuvent être valorisées à des fins énergétiques, horticoles ou autres. Dans la cogénération, par exemple, ces résidus deviennent de précieuses ressources. Au fil des ans, les usines de la pâte et du papier du Québec ont augmenté considérablement leur utilisation de biomasse.
Les combustibles renouvelables issus de la biomasse, telles les écorces, couvrent aujourd'hui près de 50 pour cent des besoins en énergie thermique des usines de papeterie du Québec. En plus de réduire l'accumulation d'écorces aux bords des scieries, cette option a permis aux usines de la pâte et du papier de réduire considérablement l'utilisation des combustibles fossiles. Cette dernière facette est importante, car elle contribue grandement à réduire les émissions de dioxyde de carbone. L'industrie forestière considère donc important de privilégier la valorisation énergétique de la biomasse.

Rice straw to ethanol project
The United States Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) is working with a private company to evaluate the potential of turning rice straw into ethanol. The project's first phase consisted of laboratory-conducted pre-feasibility studies which, according to the Biofuels UPDATE, determined the conversion yields and rates of rice straw and combustion properties of residuals from fermentation. The project is now entering its second phase which will be geared towards obtaining data to develop a business plan, as well as pilot-scale testing and refining costs.

LEAP 2000: new directions in energy analysis
A new century is approaching with new demands on incorporating environmental externalities and greenhouse gas mitigation costs in energy planning. With a need for better simulation techniques and more user-friendly tools, the Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI) is developing a new energy planning software tool - LEAP 2000.
LEAP 2000 builds on almost a decade of experience embedded in the use and development of the Long-range Energy Alternatives Planning (LEAP) system developed by SEI. (Source: Renewable Energy for Development [newsletter of the Energy, Environment and Development Programme of the Stockholm Environment Institute], March 1997.)
LEAP HAS THREE MAIN PROGRAMME GROUPS: ENERGY SCENARIOS, AGGREGATION AND THE ENVIRONMENTAL DATA BASE (EDB).
Energy scenarios
Aggregation
Environmental
data base
Demand
Transformation
Biomass
Environment
Evaluation
The Energy scenarios
group consists of several closely
linked programmes: Demand,
Transformation, Biomass, Environment
and Evaluation.
These are the main tools used to perform an
integrated energy-environment planning exercise for a single area (country, province, region, etc.).
The Aggregation programme is a tool used to
display multi-area results from analyses carried
out in different areas.
EDB can either be used as a stand-alone reference tool, or linked to the rest of LEAP to calculate
automatically emissions and other environmental impacts of energy scenarios.

Eco-efficiency: business and the environment
The business community is taking on a greater role in preventing environmental hazards, as well as in correcting them when they do occur. More and more companies take into account economic, technological and social implications when designing, producing and marketing their products.
This was not the scenario a decade ago. Those concerned about the environment often cast business in the role of the villain: the primary source of pollution and the main misuser of resources. Today, however, the countries in which business has been most successful in creating wealth for society are those most able to clean up pollution and manage resources. Nowadays these same countries must encourage developing nations to avoid the more polluting aspects of the early northern industrial revolutions and of the industrialization of centrally planned economies. "So much of the world needs to improve its standard of living," said Mr Livio DeSimone, Chief Executive Officer of 3M and Chairman of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD). "Unless that growth is controlled in a sustainable way, we will put undue stress on the planet's scarce resources."
WBCSD is committed to being a partner in protecting the environment. In a recent report, entitled Signals of change: business progress towards sustainable development, the group notes a number of changes in direction and momentum towards sustainable development. "We think that these changes signal a paradigm shift in the way in which business does business. It is a shift from a fractured view of environment and development issues to a holistic view of business and sustainable development," say the authors Stephen Schmidheiny, Chairman of Anova Holding, and Rodney Chase, Managing Director of British Petroleum - both former chairmen of the WBCSD - and Mr DeSimone. (Source: International Herald Tribune, 23 June 1997.)
Biomass in tropical countries
Tropical countries enjoy favourable conditions for growing biomass. However, constraints to optimal use as an energy source are still to be resolved. The main issues are legal and institutional barriers, as well as a lack of information and technology transfer. Furthermore, common misconceptions about biomass energy have to be redressed. It should be emphasized that the larger part of wood fuels comes from non-forest land; wood fuel use is not the root cause of deforestation; biomass energy is more than a traditional commodity; and biomass energy will not phase itself out in the foreseeable future.
Managed properly, biomass energy (or bio-energy) can be sustainable, environmentally benign and economically sound. Moreover, biomass energy creates substantial local employment. The advantages are also being recognized in industrialized countries, and several governments have successfully adopted articulate policies for promoting biomass energy.

How sustainable are energy crops in Europe?
Energy crops may play an important part in the supply of energy to the European Union. Increasing attention has been paid to these renewable energy sources since the 1970s. The contribution of biomass to the European energy supply is currently about 2 percent, and its use has increased considerably during recent years. An important stimulus for this has been the permission extended to farmers to cultivate non-food crops on fallow land, while retaining the fallow premium. Besides this, transport fuel based on agricultural crops is sold free of excise duty in a number of countries, such as France and Germany. During 1995/96, nearly 800 000 ha of fallow land in the European Union lay under rape oilseed. So the importance is clear, but how sustainable are these crops?
The Centre for Agriculture and the Environment (CLM) has developed a methodology for a systematic assessment of the ecological and socio-economic sustainability of energy crops. The report, Sustainability of energy crops in Europe - a methodology developed and applied, can be ordered from CLM. The research has been conducted with financial support from the Netherlands National Research Programme on Global Air Pollution and Climate Change (NRP/MLK) and the Netherlands Agency for Energy and the Environment (NOVEM).

Diesel fuel substitutes - Jatropha curcas L.
Following the oil crisis of the 1970s and recognition of the limitations of world oil resources, plant species which can be processed to provide a diesel fuel substitute have received special attention. Most of the research was carried out in temperate regions with the aim of making available to farmers possibilities for diversifying in view of the increasing subsidy-driven surpluses in traditional commodities. Another argument for the cultivation of oil crops for energy purposes is the increasing global warming/greenhouse effect. When these fuels are burnt, the atmosphere is not polluted by carbon dioxide, since this has already been assimilated during the growth of these crops. The CO[2] balance, therefore, remains equable.
Special interest has been shown in the physic nut (Jatropha curcas L.) for this purpose, especially since it is drought resistant and can potentially be used to produce oil from marginal semi-arid lands, without competing with food production. (Source: Extracted from Physic nut [Jatropha curcas L.] by Joachim Heller, published as No. 1 in IPGRI's Promoting the Conservation and Use of Underutilized and Neglected Crops Series.)

International symposium - Jatropha curcas
The symposium was organized by Sucher & Holzer, Austria, in cooperation with the Technical University, Managua, Karl-Franzens University, Graz and the Technical University, Graz. Sucher & Holzer is a private consultant agency which is running a project on the production of physic nut methyl esters as a substitute for diesel fuel in Nicaragua. The project is being funded by the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In the last seven years, 1 000 ha of physic nut plantations were established on private land around the town of León and a pilot plant for the production of methyl esters, aimed at producing 1 500 tonnes of methyl esters annually, is in the final stage of completion. This will eventually substitute 0.3 percent of Nicaragua's diesel fuel demand. Considerable research has recently been carried out on certain aspects of Jatropha curcas (e.g. characterization/evaluation, toxicology, pest and diseases, insecticidal properties, etc.), mainly by the Technical University,
Managua to give the Austrian development project scientific support. There is now increasing awareness of the need for provenance trials, before establishing plantations. Numerous provenances were collected from all over the region and are being characterized and evaluated in Nicaragua and Mexico. However, this happens in a rather uncoordinated way and the establishment of an informal network (which was not the objective of the symposium) would improve efficiency of these and other activities.

The vertical shaft brick kiln
The vertical shaft brick kiln (VSBK) has become widespread in China and is slowly gaining a foothold in Pakistan. In India, Bangladesh and Pakistan, the relatively energy-efficient Bull's trench kilns are standard; although VSBKs are using 30 to 50 percent less energy, this new technology still has to prove its worth locally. However, with a growing awareness of the environmental impact of the brick industry, new emission standards are now being introduced and enforced, thus providing an opportunity for the VSBK technology which pollutes less than other methods.

FAO Starts Wood Energy Project In Honduras
Following the success of its recent activities in Mexico (with the Secretaría del Medio Ambiente y Recursos Naturales [SEMARNAP]), the Dominican Republic and the northern states of Brazil, the Wood Energy Programme has initiated technical cooperation assistance with the Government of Honduras.
The main aims are to: provide advice to the National Forestry Service, COHDEFOR, for the preparation and formulation of a wood energy policy and programme to promote the development, sustainable production and use of forest biomass as a source of energy; help COHDEFOR assess the wood fuel flows around some large urban centres in order to collect field information and data to understand the dynamics of the wood fuel flow from the supply sources to the users; and identify the action required to promote more sustainable and efficient wood energy systems.
The project, funded by FAO within the framework of its Technical Cooperation Programme, has a duration of 24 months and an estimated budget of US$252 000 to cover the costs of activities and hiring international and national consultants.
