Introduction
The Monographs on the residues of the thirtheen eleven compounds contained in this volume were prepared by the forty-seventh meeting of the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA), which was held in Rome, 4-13 June 1996. JECFA has evaluated veterinary drugs at previous meetings, including the 12th ^1, 26th ^2, 27th ^3, 32nd ^4, 34th ^5, 36th ^6, 38th ^7, 40th ^8, 42nd ^9, 43rd ^10, and 45th meetings.
In response to a growing concern about mass-medication of food producing animals and the implications for human health and international trade, a Joint FAO/WHO Expert Consultation on Residues of Veterinary Drugs was convened in Rome, in November 1984^12. Among the main recommendations of this consultation were the establishment of a specialized Codex Committee on Residues of Veterinary Drugs in Foods (CCRVDF) and the periodic convening of an appropriate body to provide independent scientific advice to this Committee and to the member countries of FAO and WHO. At its first session in Washington D.C. in November 1986, the newly-created CCRVDF reaffirmed the need for such a scientific body and made a number of recommendations and suggestions to be considered by JECFA ^13. In response to these recommendations, the thirty-second JECFA meeting was entirely devoted to the evaluation of residues of veterinary drugs in foods. Subsequently, the 34th, 36th, 38th, 40th, 42nd, 43rd,
45th, and 47th meetings of JECFA were also dedicated exclusively to evaluation of veterinary drugs.
The ninth session of the CCRVDF, held in Washington D.C. during December 1995, revised the priority list of veterinary drugs requiring evaluation. The drugs evaluated during the 47th meeting of JECFA included these compounds, except ceftiofur sodium, porcine somatotropin and spectinomycin.
The present volume contains summary monographs of the residue data on all of the thirteenth compounds on the agenda. The two b -adrenoceptor blocking agents, clenbuterol and xylazine, had not been evaluated before. The two anthelminthic agents, abamectin and moxidectin had been considered before by the 45th meeting of JECFA.
From the seven antimicrobial agents, chlortetracycline, oxytetracycline, tetracycline, neomycin and spiramycin had previously been evaluated by the Committee. The remaining antimicrobial agents, thiamphenicol and tilmicosin had not been evaluated before.
The insecticides, cypermethrin and a -cypermethrin, had not been considered before.
The pertinent information in each monograph was discussed and appraised by the entire Committee. The monographs are presented in a uniform format covering identity, residues in food and their evaluation, metabolism studies, tissue residue depletion studies, methods of residue analysis and a final appraisal of the study results. More recent publications and documents are referenced, including those on which the monograph is based. A summary of the JECFA evaluations from the 32nd to the present 47th meeting is included in Annex 1.
The assistance of the experts and FAO consultant in preparing these monographs is gratefully acknowledged.

Abamectin

ADDENDUM
to the Abamectin residue monograph prepared by the 45th meeting of the Committee and published in FAO Food and Nutrition Paper 41/8, Rome 1996
Abamectin is an agricultural compound approved as a plant protection agent which is used also as a veterinary drug for control of endo- and ectoparasites. The compound was evaluated as a pesticide by JMPR in 1992 and again in 1994 where an ADI of 0-0.2 m g per kg body weight was established. This ADI was based on a no-observed adverse effect level of 0.12 mg/kg of body weight using a safety factor of 500 because of concern about the teratogenicity of the D -8,9 isomer identified as an abamectin photodegradation product found in plant products.
Abamectin was on the agenda for the 45th JECFA in 1995 for evaluation of its use as a veterinary drug, intending to rely On the toxicological evaluation performed by the 1994 JMPR Meeting. On reviewing the data related to the use(s) of abamectin, the 45th JECFA concluded that the D -8,9 isomer is not present in animal tissues when abamectin is used as a veterinary drug. Therefore, the 45th meeting of JECFA recommended that consultations be held as soon as possible by JMPR and JECFA to resolve this problem. A joint JECFA/JMPR ad-hoc meeting was held in Geneva in September 1995 on this issue. The ad-hoc meeting recognized that consideration be given for a different ADI for abamectin as a pesticide and as a veterinary drug. As a consequence the JMPR meeting held in September 1995 agreed that the ADI of 0-0.2 m g/kg bw was not appropriate for abamectin residues in animal derived food that do not contain the D -8,9 isomer. In order to accommodate this situation, this JMPR meeting
allocated an ADI of 0-1 m g/kg of body weight to abamectin on the basis of the NOEL of 0.12 mg/kg bw per day in the study of reproductive toxicity in rats and using a safety factor of 100 for veterinary drug use.
The JMPR meeting emphasized that MRLs that are recommended by JMPR and JECFA should be harmonized to include residues from the use of abamectin as a veterinary drug and the consumption by animals of fodder containing residues of abamectin.
The MRLs recommended by JMPR concerning cattle are the following
- muscle:
0.01 mg/kg
- liver, kidney:
0.05 mg/kg
Considering that:
- the ADI of 0-1 m g/kg bw established by JMPR results in a maximum allowable intake of residues of 0-60 m g for a 60 kg person
- Abamectin used as a veterinary drug is only intended for use in beef cattle
- Avermectin B[la] is considered as the appropriate marker residue
- Liver and fat are considered as the appropriate target tissues
- Abamectin does not lead to bound residues in fat tissues and that bound residues account for less than 15 % in liver
- Avermectin B[la] accounts for 42% of the total residues in liver, 25% in fat tissue and 50% in kidney at 21 days post dosing
- There is an analytical method available
The committee recommended the following values for MRLs in cattle which, for abamectin used as veterinary drug, are expressed as avermectin B[la]:
- fat, liver:
100 m g/kg
- kidney:
50 m g/kg
As abamectin is only intended for beef cattle, there is no need for an MRL in bovine milk. Recognizing that liver, kidney and fat are the only tissues appropriate for monitoring residues of abamectin in animal tissues, there is no need for an MRL in bovine muscle where residues deplete to non-detectable concentrations at the recommended withdrawal time. Nevertheless, the JECFA recognized that JMPR has established MRL's for abamectin used as pesticide that are suitable for residues in cattle muscle and milk.
These MRLs result in a theoretical maximum daily intake of total residues of abamectin of 49 m g which, considering the total intake of 60 m g, gives an acceptable margin of safety for the possible additional ingestion of residues from pesticide use by consumption of fruits and vegetables and from the consumption of meat from cattle ingesting some contaminated fodder.

Chlortetracycline and tetracyline
First draft prepared by

ADDENDUM
to the chlortetracycline and tetracycline monographs prepared by the 45th meeting of the Committee and published in FAO Food and Nutrition Paper 41/8, Rome 1996
Introduction
The 36th Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives meeting in 1990 established MRLs for oxytetracycline of 600 m g/kg in kidney; 300 m g/kg in liver; 100 m g/kg in muscle; 100 m g/kg in milk; 200 m g/kg in eggs; and 10 m g/kg in fat ^1 for all species for which residue depletion data were provided (cattle, swine, sheep, chickens, turkeys and fish). These MRLs were approved through the CODEX Alimentarius Commission in 1994.
^1 Note, die FAO Food and Nutrition Paper 41/3, incorrectly reports the MRL for fat as 100 m g/kg.
An ADI of 0-3 m g/kg of body weight was assigned to oxytetracycline. The MRLs assigned by the Committee were based on the lowest values which could be monitored with the microbiological methods of analysis available at that time. Consequently, the 36th JECFA panel concluded that "the estimated maximum daily intake of oxytetracycline is 150 m g in milk, 30 m g in muscle, 0.5 m g in fat, 20 m g in eggs, 30 m g in liver, and 30 m g in kidney taking into account the food intake data as stated on page 9 of the 36th report of the Committee, WHO Technical Report Series 799, Geneva 1990, yielding a total of approximately 260 m g. This value slightly exceeds the ADI of 200 m g per person (one-tenth of the no-observed-effect-level of 2 mg per day). Since the ADI was derived from a conservative value of 2 mg per person per day and the consumption data are at the upper limit of the range for individual intake of animal products, the Committee concluded that the recommended MRLs do not
present a risk for the consumer.
The MRL of 100 m g/kg recommended for milk contributed 150 m g to the theoretical food basket (daily consumption 1.5 1) and was the major factor in assuring that the ADI was exceeded by 30%.
The 45th Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives meeting in 1995 allocated the same ADIs and MRLs, except milk, to chlortetracycline and tetracycline as those previously allocated to oxytetracycline at the 36th meeting, 100 m g/kg for muscle (cattle, pigs, poultry), 300 m g/kg for liver (cattle, pigs, sheep, poultry), 600 m g/kg for kidney (cattle, pigs, sheep, poultry), and 200 m g/kg for eggs (poultry). The MRLs were temporary pending further information as indicated below. Although the Committee realised that it is unlikely that tetracyclines will be used in combination, the MRLs allocated to the tetracyclines were defined as applying to both individual tetracyclines or the sum of the combined tetracycline residues. The ADI of 0-3 m g/kg of body weight previously assigned to oxytetracycline was converted to a group ADI with chlortetracycline and tetracycline at that meeting.
In arriving at its determination of MRLs, the 45th JECFA considered the recommendations of the 36th JECFA for oxytetracycline outlined above in combination with the decision to allocate a group ADI to CTC, OTC and TC. Target tissues for the analysis of all three tetracyclines were kidney and muscle in cattle, pigs and poultry and, based on limited data, kidney was the target tissue in sheep.
The following information was required for evaluation by the 47th JECFA in 1996:
1. The results of residue depletion studies in milk (cattle), in fat of cattle, pigs and poultry and in muscle, liver, kidney and fat of sheep in accordance with approved uses of these substances.
2. New and validated methods of analysis of chlortetracycline, oxytetracycline and tetracycline.
TISSUE RESIDUE DEPLETION STUDIES
General
It was inferred during discussions at the 45th JECFA that possibly specific formulations were both registered and used on a regular enough basis perhaps to warrant demands for extra residue data.
The report of the 45th JECFA reflected these discussions by requiring results of residue depletion studies in milk (cattle), in fat of cattle, pigs and poultry and in muscle, liver, kidney and fat of sheep in accordance with approved uses of these substances. The problems raised by this requirement is that the various formulations, particularly those used in milk production, were not specifically identified. Indeed, it was not certain if many of the formulations mentioned by several Committee members during discussion of chlortetracycline and tetracycline were registered or even currently available.
The information supplied is almost entirely derived by a re-culling of the initial extensive dossier supplied by Cyanamid. Furthermore, it deals exclusively with chlortetracycline data with no mention whatever of tetracycline residue data. Most of the information given below was included in the FAO Food and Nutrition Paper 41/8, but is reiterated here for the reader's easy reference.
Sheep
Two studies detail work on the depletion of chlortetracycline residues in liver, kidney and muscle tissues and in fat from sheep following dosing with 50 mg/kg, of chlortetracycline with and without 50 mg/kg of sulfamethazine (SMZ) in the feed for 42 Days.

Milk
Soluble bolus formulations of chlortetracycline are used for vaginal or intrauterine administration in cows for reproductive infections. A study was conducted in which four lactating Holstein cows received intrauterine administration of four chlortetracycline soluble boluses (2 grams chlortetracycline) as a single treatment 1 to 3 days postpaltum. Average blood concentrations of chlortetracycline peaked at 0.149 mg/kg four hours after treatment, dropped below 0.05 mg/kg by day 3 post-treatment, and were not detected at 5 and 7 days post-treatment. Average levels of chlortetracycline in milk peaked at 0.146 mg/kg on day 1 post-treatment, dropped below 0.05 mg/kg by day 3 post-treatment, and were not detectable at 5, 6 and 7 days after treatment (Goodale, 1988a).
Residue data are available for two intramammary infusion products used for treatment of mastitis. The first study was conducted using an infusion product containing 426 mg of chlortetracycline per 6 mL syringe. One syringe was infused in each of the four quarters of the udder, and milk samples were assayed at 12-hour intervals until 120 hours post-medication. The 12-hour post-medication milk showed the highest activity, averaging 70 mg/kg chlortetracycline at that time. All milk samples were still positive at 96 hours post-treatment (average 0.07 mg/kg chlortetracycline). Four of the six cows still showed low activity (0.012 to 0.03 mg/kg) at the final sampling 120 hours post-treatment (Hewell, 1967). The second study was conducted with TARGOT^ (R) mastitis suspension containing 200 mg of chlortetracycline, 100 mg neomycin sulfate and 100 mg of dihydrostreptomycin sulfate (the latter two measured as base) per 6 mL syringe. One syringe was infused in each quarter of the
udders of 10 clinically normal Dairy Friesians yielding approximately two gallons of milk daily. Individual cow milk samples were taken at 12-hour intervals for 144 hours after treatment. All milk samples contained less than 0.03 mg/kg chlortetracycline/mL at 120 hours after infusion and less than 0.125 mg/kg dihydrostreptomycin sulfate-neomycin sulfate (combined assay) at 72 hours after treatment (Nelson, 1968). A summary of the mean milk chlortetracycline levels are shown in Table 2.

Mean chlortetracycline level (mg/L)
Assay limit (mg/L)
Studies have shown that milk from cows receiving 0.22 mg chlortetracycline/kg b.w. daily by feed medication has no detectable chlortetracycline residues (Henderson, 1953; Shor et al, 1959). When the feeding level of chlortetracycline was increased to 1.1 or 2.2 mg/kg b.w. daily, small amounts (up to 0.23 mg/L) were found in the milk. After 48 hours withdrawal of medicated rations, all milk samples were again negative. The sensitivity of the assay was 0.01 mg/L.
Cattle
Drain (1966a) report results of feeding 2.78 mg of CTC/kg to cattle for 30 days. Chlortetracycline residue levels in kidney and liver reached 0.37 and 0.16 mg/kg respectively whereas fat levels never exceeded the assay reporting level of 0.025 mg/kg. Similar negative fat results were obtained by Langner (1976) by feeding 1.01 mg of CTC/kg to cattle for 28 days and Colavita (1967) by feeding 2.01 mg of CTC/kg to cattle for 29 days.
The depletion of chlortetracycline from edible tissues of calves following a 10-day treatment at a dose of 22 mg/kg b.w. daily is presented in Table 3. These were young calves, averaging 42 kg b.w., receiving a milk replacer diet with medication supplied by soluble boluses once daily. Residues at zero-day withdrawal were highest in kidney, followed by liver, muscle and fat. After ten days withdrawal, residues of 0.06 to 0.15 mg/kg and 0.14 to 0.16 mg/kg remained in liver and kidney tissue, respectively. As has been shown in other species, the kidney and liver can be considered the target tissues.

A summary of recent chlortetracycline depletion studies from liver and kidney of young calves following therapeutic doses of the drug from various dosage formulations for 7 consecutive days is shown in Table 4.
The calves in two of the studies received a diet of whole milk (Berger, 1989b; Goodale, 1988c), while in the other two studies the calves received a diet of reconstituted milk replacer (Rooney, 1988b, 1989b)). The daily doses of chlortetracycline ranged from 13.3 to 30.2 mg/kg bw. Residues of chlortetracycline at zero-day withdrawal were not directly proportional to the administered dose. The comparative results at day zero withdrawal between bolus formulation, where the average daily dose of 21.7 mg/kg exceeded the average of 13.3 mg/kg given in a soluble powder formulation are particularly intriguing. The soluble powder gave liver and kidney residue values of 13.7 and 19.2 mg/kg, well in excess of those from the bolus formulation (1.82 and 2.18 mg/kg in liver and kidney respectively). No ready explanation could be advanced for such disparate results. Residues from liver and kidney samples did not exceed 0.05 mg/kg after the 25-day withdrawal or the 45-day withdrawal
respectively. Although not shown in Table 4, no detectable chlortetracycline residues were found in fat samples after the zero-day withdrawal.

In summary, it should be noted that it is only at very high chlortetracycline dosing levels that fat residues are found and that these residue are 10-fold lower that the residues found in kidney and liver. No residues have been detected in fat at a withdrawal time where kidney tissue meets the assigned group MRL for tetracyclines.
Pigs
Data from studies in which pigs received 110 mg/kg chlortetracycline in feed for periods of 31 and 98 consecutive days are summarised in Table 5. When 330 mg/kg chlortetracycline was fed for a 98-day period (Berger, 1966b - see FNP 41/8, p. 51), residue levels of chlortetracycline were about twice those for pigs fed 110 mg/kg chlortetracycline for the same time (Sass and Messersmith, 1964; Stoner, 1962b). Drug levels in fat were more than 10 times lower than found in kidney and liver at early stages of withdrawal and chlortetracycline could not be detected after 5 days following withdrawal of treatment.

Residue depletion data for edible tissues of pigs fed 440 mg/kg Chlortetracycline in feed for 14 days is presented in Table 6. These data demonstrate that swine are similar to other species in that the highest and most persistent residues occur in kidney and liver tissue but are more than 10-fold lower in fat (Berger, 1983).

Additional studies have been conducted in which 300 and 400 mg/kg Chlortetracycline in feed were given to pigs for 7 consecutive days (Gingher, 1990d). As shown in Table 7, levels of Chlortetracycline in fat were very much less than those in liver and kidney and were not detected 5 days after withdrawal.

Poultry
Chickens
Two separate studies (Drain, 1962a; Gingher, 1980) in older chickens adminstered 220 mg/kg Chlortetracycline in the feed showed residue levels of 0.66 and 0.71 mg/kg in liver and 0.42 and 0.75 mg/kg in kidney, respectively, at day 0 after withdrawal of medication compared to levels of 0.02 and 0.04 mg/kg in skin with adhering fat. At day 1 withdrawal no residues of Chlortetracycline were detected in fat. Similarly, Gingher (1979) found no Chlortetracycline residues in fat of chickens, fed medicated diets of 110 ppm Chlortetracycline with added monensin for 51 days, 1 day after withdrawal of medic
