This year's Commodity Market Review (CMR), FAO's annual publication on food and agricultural commodities and trade, introduces some innovations over earlier editions. The main focus of the CMR in the past was on a review of developments in commodity markets, describing the current situation and the shortterm outlook. This new edition includes five analytical articles which look beyond the current situation and outlook to explain in more detail and explain some of the implications of factors which shape commodity market developments and topical policy issues. In this edition there are articles on long term trends in basic foodstuffs prices, the influence of oil prices on agricultural commodity prices, tariff peaks and tariff-cutting formulae, African food deficits and surpluses, and the impact of the Uruguay Round Agreement on Agriculture. The situation and outlook of food and agricultural commodity markets is still here in Part II of the new publication, but in a slightly condensed form. Market reviews are presented for 19 food and agricultural commodities. Increasingly this material is being presented on the Commodities and Trade Division webpages on the FAO website at www.fao.org (under Economics, Commodities and Trade), which provide greater scope for timely dissemination of more detailed market information and more frequent updating than is possible with conventional printed publications. The webpages themselves are also undergoing some redesign to increase their content, but also to make them easier to access and to use.

The following symbols are used: ... $ "1999-01" "2000/01" = = = = = none or negligible not available US dollar average for three calendar years 1999, 2000 and 2001 a 12-month crop, marketing or fiscal year spanning the two years shown.
The metric system is used unless otherwise specified. Data on production, trade, etc. are given on a calendar year basis unless otherwise specified. Data on stocks refer to levels of national stocks at the end of calendar or respective marketing years as specified by commodity. Percentage changes and annual rates of change have been calculated from unrounded figures. Also, figures may not add up to the totals because of rounding. Differences between total exports and total imports may be due to several factors, including the time-lag between the dispatch of goods from the exporting country and their arrival in the importing country, and the use of a different classification of the same product by exporting and importing countries. In addition, total values of exports and imports differ because exports are generally valued at the point of export (fob) and imports include insurance and freight to the point of import (cif). Aggregate exports and imports of the EC and those of country groupings comprising the EC exclude intra-EC trade, unless otherwise stated. The EC data refer to EC-12 up to 1994 and EC-15 from 1995. Unless otherwise stated, all statistics for China include the Province of Taiwan, but not the Special Administrative Region of Hong Kong. Country groupings In the presentation and analysis of data, countries are grouped into two main categories: "developing countries" and "developed countries" unless otherwise specified. The designation "developing" and "developed" is intended for statistical convenience and does not necessarily express a judgement about the stage reached by a particular country or area in the development process. The country classification within these two broad groups is as follows: Developing countries include: Africa (all continental Africa, excluding the Republic of South Africa); Near East, comprising Afghanistan, Bahrain, Cyprus, Egypt, Islamic Republic of Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, Oman, Qatar, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Syrian Arab Republic, Turkey, United Arab Emirates and Yemen; Far East, comprising all other countries in continental Asia and the Pacific region, excluding those countries of the region classified as developed countries; Latin America and the Caribbean (including Mexico). Developed countries include: North America (excluding Mexico); Europe, comprising Western Europe (including the area of former Yugoslavia) and Eastern Europe (Albania, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Slovakia); the area of the former USSR; Oceania (Australia and New Zealand); other developed (Israel, Japan and the Republic of South Africa).
GENERAL REVIEW.
This chapter reviews recent market developments and comments on the short-term outlook for major agricultural commodities on the basis of the information available at the time of writing. Readers are referred to the Commodities and Trade Division webpages for the most recent statistical data and analysis. Agricultural commodity markets are much-influenced by global and regional economic growth, so the chapter begins with a brief review of global economic prospects as seen by the international macroeconomics forecasts of the World Bank, the IMF and the OECD.
The global economic background.
Global economic growth slowed considerably in the last quarter of 2000 and the first three quarters of 2001. There is broad consensus among the macroeconomic forecasts of the IMF, the World Bank and the OECD that 2001 will show a significant slowdown with the annual growth rate at 2-2.5 percent. This largely reflects the sharp downturn in the US economy, although the economic performance of most industrial countries has weakened. Recovery is expected in 2002 on the basis of stronger economic fundamentals world wide compared with the previous few years. The IMF predicts growth will accelerate to 3.5 percent for the year, although other forecasts are more pessimistic in the light of the potential economic repercussions of the terrorist attacks of 11 September. The June 2001 OECD Economic Outlook projects real GDP growth of 2 percent for the OECD member countries, somewhat higher than the IMF projection of 1.3 percent growth for advanced economies and the World Bank projection of 1.2 percent for high-income countries.1 Similarly, the OECD forecasts 2002 growth of 2.8 percent for its member countries, compared with lower projections by the IMF of 2.1 percent for advanced economies and the World Bank of 1.0-1.5 percent for high-income countries revised downwards after the attacks from 2.2 percent. However, all forecasts are in broad agreement regarding economic fundamentals. The IMF's forecasts made before the attacks of 11 September, predict that the 2001 economic slowdown in developing countries would be much shallower than that for industrialised countries, at 4.3 percent, recovering to 5.3 percent in 2002, or 2.9 percent and 3.9 percent respectively in per caput terms. However, the World Bank predicts that the events of 11 September will also have serious repercussions for developing countries, as the delayed recovery in high-income countries translates into slower growth for developing countries. Particularly hard hit, would be developing countries that are dependent on tourism, remittances from populations living overseas, and foreign investment. World Bank 2002 GDP growth projections for developing countries have been revised downward by 0.5-0.75 percent, to 3.5-3.8 percent. The strongest growth amongst developing countries is expected in Asia, although aggregate forecasts for Asia mask the divergent performance of China versus the rest of the region, where many countries are more exposed to global markets in the high technology sector. For these countries, the slow-down in the United States and Japan has a direct effect on economic performance. Developing countries in the Near East and the Western Hemisphere are forecast to have per caput growth rates only slightly above zero in 2001. The weak performance of the Near Eastern countries is attributed to the global slow-down, lower petroleum prices and the deteriorating security situation in the region. Per caput growth for this group of countries is projected to accelerate to 2.8 percent in 2002 assuming that oil prices strengthen. Recovery is predicted for the Western Hemisphere developing countries in 2002 on the basis of improving economic fundamentals in some of the major countries of the region. In contrast to other regions, the developing countries of Africa are predicted to post stronger GDP growth in 2001 than in 2000, improving further in 2002. In per caput terms, however, output growth in Africa is forecast to reach only 1.4 percent in 2001 and 1.9 percent in 2002. Sound macroeconomic and structural.

COMMODITY MARKET REVIEW 2001-02.
policies in many countries of Africa are credited with promoting a recovery in per caput growth, although in others prospects for growth and poverty alleviation continue to be hampered by economic and political uncertainties, including ongoing conflicts. For the countries in transition, per caput GDP growth is forecast at 4-4.5 percent in 2001 and 2002, higher than the corresponding aggregate rates due to continued population declines in many countries. From 1999, growth in these countries has recovered dramatically after a decade during which real GDP shrank almost 20 percent. Keys to continued growth, according to the IMF, are accelerating structural reforms, particularly strengthening institutions and governance, restructuring public enterprises and the financial sector, and defining the role of the state.
Agricultural export earnings and food import bills.
The value of exports of major agricultural products increased in 2000 by 4.2 percent, reversing the downward trend that began after 1996 (see Table 1.1). The increase in the value of exports of dairy products was the largest contributor to this (32.3 percent), followed by those of sugar (24.5 percent) and agricultural raw materials (9.3 percent). All other major commodity groups experienced declines in the value of their exports, with beverage crops leading the way with 17.9 percent. The declines for meat products, cereals and oilcrops were much smaller at 1.4, 0.3 and 0.6 percent, respectively. However, the extent of the increase in export earnings was not the same for developing and developed countries; the former experiencing a rise of only 1.0 percent as opposed to the 5.8 percent experienced by the latter, with the significant increase in the value of exports of dairy products from developed countries making the greatest contribution.

As for the value of imports of major food commodities (see Table 1.2), the developing countries experienced a 10.3 percent increase in their expenditures, with significant increases for dairy products (30.5 percent) and meat (12.6 percent), as well as for oils and fats (11.2 percent), which were, however, accompanied by increases in the volume of flows for all commodity groups, including cereals. But the expenditure on food commodities of Low Income Food Deficit Countries (LIFDCs) only rose by 0.4 percent, in part due to decreased volume of imports of especially meat products and oils and fats, of 13.2 and 1.4 percent respectively.

THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE FOURTH WTO MINISTERIAL CONFERENCE FOR AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FORESTRY.
At the Fourth World Trade Organization (WTO) Ministerial Conference held in Doha, Qatar from 9-14 November 2001, the WTO Members agreed to launch a new round of multilateral trade negotiations that will have important implications for agriculture, fisheries and forestry. In addition to the talks on agriculture and services that have been underway for over a year, the new round will cover a much broader agenda, including other sectors of the global economy as well as a range of implementation issues that have arisen since the Uruguay Round Agreements came into force. The outcome of the Conference improves the prospects that progress will be made in the negotiations on agriculture because it enhances the opportunities for trade-offs with other sectors and addresses a number of concerns that have hindered the negotiations thus far. The new round offers opportunities for further market liberalisation in non-agricultural goods. The negotiations will also cover foreign investment, competition policy, government procurement, as well as trade and environment, and will revisit WTO rules regarding trade-related intellectual property rights (TRIPS), dispute settlement, subsidies and countervailing measures and anti-dumping. A substantial work programme was agreed in the area of environment and trade. The Ministers also made a commitment to provide special and differential treatment for developing countries, including the objective of duty-free, quota-free market access for products originating from least developed countries (LDCs). The technical co-operation and capacity building needs of small, vulnerable and low-income transition economies were also recognised, and the delivery of technical assistance was emphasized. Elements of the negotiations that are particularly relevant to agriculture, fisheries and forestry are summarised below. Agriculture: The WTO Members recognized the work already undertaken in the negotiations that began in March 2000 under Article 20 of the Agreement on Agriculture. They agreed to undertake "comprehensive negotiations aimed at: substantial improvements in market access; reductions of, with a view of phasing out, all forms of export subsidies; and substantial reductions in trade-distorting domestic support." Special and differential treatment is to be provided for developing countries to enable them to take account effectively of their development needs, including food security and rural development. Non-trade concerns is to be taken into account. Modalities for the further commitments are to be established no later than 31 March 2003 and comprehensive draft Schedules of commitments based on these modalities submitted no later than the date of the Fifth Session of the WTO Ministerial Conference (which must be held before the end of 2003). The negotiations on agriculture will be concluded as part and at the date of conclusion of the negotiating agenda of the round as a whole. Market Access for non-agricultural products: Negotiations in this area will aim, by modalities to be agreed upon, to reduce or eliminate tariffs including the reduction or elimination of tariff peaks, high tariffs and tariff escalation, as well as non-tariff barriers. Product coverage shall be comprehensive and without a priori exclusions. Fishery and forestry products and agricultural products that were excluded from the Agreement on Agriculture such as rubber and hard fibres will be covered under the new round. TRIPS: It was agreed to negotiate the establishment of a multilateral system of notification and registration of geographical indications for wine and spirits. Issues related to the extension of the protection of geographical indications to products other than wine and spirits will be addressed in the Council for TRIPS. The WTO Committee for TRIPS was further instructed to examine inter alia the relationship between the TRIPS Agreement and the Convention on Biological Diversity and the protection of traditional knowledge and folklore. Subsides and Countervailing measures: Negotiations will aim at clarifying and improving disciplines under the Uruguay Round Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures. The Conference agreed specifically that the negotiations would "aim to clarify and improve WTO disciplines on fishery subsidies, taking into account the importance of this sector to developing countries." Trade and Environment: The Ministerial Declaration, for the first time, recognized the right of each country to take measures to protect the environment "at the levels it considers appropriate" on the same basis as measures taken for the protection of human, animal and plant life or health, i.e. provided such measures are not applied in an arbitrary or discriminatory manner or as a disguised restriction on trade and that they are in compliance with other WTO provisions. It was agreed that there would be negotiations on the relationship between existing WTO rules and specific trade obligations set out in multilateral environmental agreements and on the reduction of or elimination of tariff and nontariff barriers to environmental goods and services. The negotiations will be supervised by a Trade Negotiations Committee, which will hold its first meeting not later than 31 January 2002 to establish the appropriate negotiating mechanisms in each area as required. It was agreed that the negotiations will be concluded by 1 January 2005.
PART II REVIEW OF AGRICULTURAL COMMODITY MARKETS.
REVIEW OF AGRICULTURAL COMMODITY MARKETS.
Beverages, sugar and fruits.
The fall of coffee and cocoa prices to their lowest levels for several decades provides the most dramatic example of the current depressed state of most agricultural commodity markets. Prices for tea have also weakened as supplies have grown ahead of demand. There appears little prospect of an early recovery in beverage prices and attempts to coordinate international action to restrain supply growth have been unsuccessful. International attempts to stimulate demand by shifting consumer preferences may prove more effective, but with a longer lead time. Sugar prices fared rather better during 2000, but have declined during 2001, and again, expected production growth ahead of demand in the short term will make it difficult to achieve higher prices. In international markets for fruits, market imbalance appears currently to be more in the opposite direction, with reduced citrus production and continuing growth in import demand for tropical fruits, although even here any strengthening of prices is expected to be limited in the short run.
The ICO composite prices averaged 64 US cents per pound in 2000, more than 25 percent lower than the already depressed price level of 1999. Prices in 2001 are the lowest since 1973 in nominal terms and the lowest ever in constant terms. While prices for both Arabica and Robusta varieties have declined substantially, the fall in Robusta prices has been particularly pronounced.

The Association of Coffee Producing Countries' export retention scheme was effectively abandoned as prices continued to decline. Slow-down in the economies of many coffee importing countries and relatively high stock levels implies continuing sluggish demand at least for the near term. Improving quality has been suggested as one way to improving market prices. However, with current price levels below production costs of many coffee producers, investment is inevitably curtailed, and this could adversely affect quality and the prospects for price recovery. World green coffee production reached 6.6 million tonnes in 2000/01 crop year (October-September), a growth of 4 percent from the previous crop year. Production in Latin America declined, reflecting reductions in Brazil, the world's largest producer (by 1 percent to 1.9 million tonnes), Guatemala (down 14 percent), and Mexico (down 30 percent) as growers in the region adjusted to low world market prices. The only notable increase among Latin American countries occurred in Colombia, where production increased by 29 percent as a result of favourable weather and the earlier renovation of coffee plants under the scheme launched by the National Growers Federation. Output in Africa fell by 12 percent from 1999/00 to 2000/01 mainly because of a significant decline in output in Côte d'Ivoire to 190 000 tonnes from the abnormally high level of 354 000 tonnes in 1999/00. Most other major coffee producers in Africa increased output: production in Ethiopia, Kenya and Uganda registered a growth of 5 percent, 12 percent and 3 percent,.
respectively. In Asia, Vietnam's production remained unchanged at 700 000 tonnes, but still 68 percent higher than in 1998/99. Output in Indonesia increased by 23 percent from the previous crop year but was still 21 percent lower than in 1998/99. In terms of varieties, the share of arabicas in world coffee production in 2000/01 was around 66 percent, the same as in 1999/00. The increase in output of Colombian milds was sufficient to offset the considerable decline in production of other milds, particularly from Central America. Coffee stocks decreased by 6 percent in producing countries in 2000/01 mainly due to reduced production in Latin America. However, the significant increase in stocks in major coffee consuming countries, including the EC, Japan and the United States, more than offset the decline in producing countries. World exports of coffee reached 5.3 million tonnes in 2000, a growth of 4 percent from the 1999 level. Exports from Brazil fell by 22 percent to 1.1 million tonnes and accounted for 20 percent of world coffee exports in 2000. Exports from Colombia declined by 8 percent. Exports from Guatemala and Mexico increased by 4 percent and 22 percent respectively, but this was not enough to offset the decline in other Latin American countries. Most African coffee exporting countries except Uganda registered some growth, as did exports from Asian coffee exporting countries. Exports from Vietnam continued to grow rapidly, by almost 50 percent between 1999 and 2000. World coffee imports increased slightly to reach 4.8 million tonnes in 2000. The increase was mainly attributable to growth in the United States and Japan. Imports into the EC (15) were down marginally in the same year. Provisional data suggest a small decline in world coffee imports in 2001. Per caput consumption of coffee in importing countries as a whole decreased by nearly 4 percent between 1999 and 2000. Domestic consumption in producing countries as a whole increased by 6 percent between 1999/2000 and 2000/2001 Consumption in Viet Nam increased by more than 40 percent, and this emerging market has potential for further expansion.
The ICCO daily price averaged $888 per tonne in 2000, the lowest since 1973 in nominal terms. During the first 10 months of 2001 prices fluctuated around an average of $1 058 per tonne. This is 16 percent higher than the same period last year but still 12 percent and 38 percent lower than in 1999 and 1998.

World cocoa bean production reached 2.8 million tonnes in the 2000/01 crop year (October-September), 7 percent lower than in the previous season, but still slightly higher than in 1998/99. Production in major African cocoa producing countries as a whole declined in 2000/01, mainly due to a 16 percent fall in Côte d'Ivoire, the world's largest producer with more than 40 percent of world production. Côte d'Ivoire produced 1.2 million tonnes of cocoa beans in 2000/01, almost the same as in 1998/99. Output fell significantly in Ghana as a result of black pod disease, although production increased in Cameroon and Nigeria. Two major Asian producers, Indonesia and Malaysia, recorded declines of 1 percent and 11 percent, respectively partly because of reduced yields following lower investment. Most major cocoa bean producing countries in Latin America increased output: Brazil by 11 percent; Dominican Republic by 29 percent; and Ecuador by 5 percent. Global grindings of cocoa beans, a proxy for world cocoa consumption, reached 3 million tonnes in 2000/01, up 1.5 percent compared to 1999/00. Grindings in the EC, the world's largest cocoa consumer, reached 1.2 million tonnes in 2000/01, a growth of 1.6 percent. Among the major consuming countries, the area of the former USSR registered the highest growth at 11.8 percent over the previous year. Grindings in Canada were down by 11 percent and those in the United States remained at the previous year's level. Grindings in Côte d'Ivoire continued to increase and reached 265 thousand tonnes in 2000/01 as a result of the government's subsidy scheme to promote domestic processing. Grindings at origin accounted for about 32 percent of world grindings in 2000/01. Cocoa bean stocks fell by 15 percent to 1.1 million tonnes in 2000/01 as production decreased while demand slightly increased. The world stock-to-grinding ratio, a proxy for world cocoa availability, fell from 45 to 38 percent in 2000/01. However this decline was not large enough to change the price trend as current stocks are considered sufficient to meet world cocoa demand. World exports of cocoa reached 2.5 million tonnes in 1999/00, a growth of 13 percent from the 1998/99 level, reflecting increases in the world's three largest cocoa bean exporting countries. Exports from Côte d'Ivoire, the largest exporter, increased by 28 percent or nearly 300 000 tonnes echoing increased output. Exports from Ghana and Indonesia, the world's second and third largest exporters, continued to grow with increases over the previous year of 2 percent and 6 percent, respectively. World cocoa imports increased by 16 percent reaching 2.5 million tonnes in 1999/00, largely as a result of increased imports by the EC, Former USSR and the United States. Imports into the EC and the United States increased as manufacturers and processors took advantage of low world prices. The EC recorded an overall increase of 6 percent in 1999/00, reaching 1.2 million tonnes - 50 percent of world imports. Imports into the United States increased by 22 percent and accounted for about 20 percent of world imports. Imports into the Former USSR recovered to their 1997/98 level after being depressed over the intervening period by economic downturn and devaluation. World cocoa bean production in 2001/02 is expected to recover to its 1999/2000 level as a result of more favourable weather conditions in West
